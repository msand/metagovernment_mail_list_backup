<PRE>First, hi! I'm the guy who wrote the essay 'The &quot;Killer App&quot; of Public
Participation' being discussed on this list. Mr. Pastore was kind enough
to point out the discussion thread, so I figured I'd join and put my two
cents' in.

My user page on the Wiki is:

I believe you misinterpreted the intent there, perhaps because the essay
was a bit of a rush job, as I didn't find out about the contest until
fairly late. And I'm kinda wordy, so 1,500 words was a bit of a
straitjacket.

It's not that residency is required to vote, but that residency is a
valid criterion -- those reviewing the aggregated positions can use
residency information to help them sift through the results.

There is a positive incentive to provide residency (your positions are
more likely to be examined), but it is not required, nor does not being
a resident of a community prevent one from raising an issue or taking a
position.

&gt;<i> While I think geographic standing is a weighting factor, I do not
</I>&gt;<i> think it is at all good to exclude people because they do not meet a
</I>&gt;<i> geographic requirement.
</I>
Nobody should be excluded from taking a position or having said position
be included in the raw results for an issue.

&gt;<i> As I have mentioned before, locality is often
</I>&gt;<i> a false indication of interest/standing. For example, everyone
</I>&gt;<i> downstream of a city has an interest in the water-diverting industries
</I>&gt;<i> of that city. Or everyone in the world may have an interest in a
</I>&gt;<i> country's decision which affects the survival of an endangered
</I>&gt;<i> species.
</I>
True. However, bear in mind that decision-makers may or may not wish to
take that into account, and it is their right to examine the data and
make decisions as they see fit...at least in my vision for cooperative
democracy.

That represents a difference in philosophy between the Metascore
(&quot;intended to act as the *replacement* for the governance system of any
community which currently relies on representative democracy for
governance&quot;) and cooperative democracy (intended to serve as a
complement to representative democracy, not necessarily a flat-out
replacement).
