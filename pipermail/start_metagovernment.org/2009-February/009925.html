Aww, that's no fun.

I was enjoying the healthy debate, I am sorry if anything came across
as a subtle barb - we all want essentially the same thing - no hard
feelings intended.


&gt;<i> Thank you for your reply, Richard.  If the others on this list agree with

</I>
I hear your frustration, but I don't agree that nothing is being done.
We have a few developers who are working steadily towards the first
release - it's not a trivial endeavour. I know because I've been
independently coding my own metascore-ish type system for the last two
years.

I've found that it's not like designing a word-processor, it's like
designing the first ever word processor - there can be a bewildering
number of design choices, without precedent. Because of this, simply
throwing more developers at a v1.0 problem doesn't always help.


&gt;<i> I would like to clarify one item, because what I said was in error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I misspoke in my letter by saying our ideal is that someday we won't need a
</I>&gt;<i> leader.  This was incorrect.  We are building MetaScore to lead us by
</I>&gt;<i> synthesizing the collective opinion of participants.  We will certainly
</I>&gt;<i> still have a leader, it will just be the software which is pointing the way.
</I>
This might come across as meaningless semantic bashing, but I think
the distinction is important -- the primary aspect of a &quot;leader&quot; which
is deemed undesirable is human fallibility - ego, pride, corruption,
insanity - bias of all kinds.

So to say that Metascore will be a leader is misleading.


&gt;<i> The problem this is creating is that we are waiting, leaderless, for
</I>&gt;<i> MetaScore to lead us.  But MetaScore requires strong leadership to create.
</I>&gt;<i> And so we are in limbo.  I am trying to rouse us to action, and specifically
</I>&gt;<i> to encourage Ed, who is the figurehead of MetaGovernment, to step forward
</I>&gt;<i> and accept the mantle of leadership until it may be effectively passed to
</I>&gt;<i> MetaScore.
</I>
Can you point to any evidence that Metascore is in danger of not being
developed? Without seeing the problem I find it hard to take your
fears seriously, but I am perfectly willing to listen if you have the
patience to walk me through it.

Best regards,
Richard
