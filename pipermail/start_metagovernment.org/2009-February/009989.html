No, there will be an actual requirement for elected officials to
follow the consensus of the electorate.  The mechanics of that
requirement are discussed in detail, in the thread &quot;Time of trouble -
Premise 2&quot;:
  
  <A HREF="http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2009-February/024194.html">http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2009-February/024194.html</A>

See the term PD(o)?  That's a consensus - not about a proposal for the
consideration of elected officials - but about *who* should hold
office.  PD(o) is a continuous, on-line, cross-party primary, but its
votes will translate naturally into concrete, paper ballots at the
next general election (b.2).

So you can see the actual requirement here.  An elected official who
fails to support a consensus bill will immediately lose votes in the
PD(o) primary.  Unless she does something to regain them, she will
lose the next election.  She knows this, of course.  She knows it,
because she tracks the PD(o) polls - the real consensus - and not a
fake substitute.  The upshot is that no assembly - excepting the
unelected upper assemblies and judiciary - could lightly defy a public
consensus and expect to remain in office.  So they'll be passing
consensus bills, following consensus policy, and executing consensus
plans.

&gt;<i> In this regard, Metagovernment is certainly distinguished by its
</I>&gt;<i> intent to supersede decision-makers by making them
</I>&gt;<i> obsolete. Theoretically, other tools could start out as advisory and
</I>&gt;<i> then grow into full governance mechanisms, but MG is working from
</I>&gt;<i> the very outset on the idea that individuals should not have the
</I>&gt;<i> power of decision-making for the community...
</I>
That distinctive aim doesn't entitle you, however, to any sort of
priority, or super-project status.  You are a single project (or group
of prototype projects) working alongside all the others.  All are
peers, on a level.

&gt;<i> ...This means our initial approached all of our architecture is
</I>&gt;<i> built around bringing consensus out of conflict in such a manner
</I>&gt;<i> that end decisions can be reached by the crowd.
</I>
(I guess all of the projects have this same approach - we're all into
public decision-making.)

&gt;<i> &gt; ... I'm going to suggest that the crucial thing is transparency -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; laying out the cards so that everyone (tech, non-tech and user)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; knows it's a fair deal and can see the choices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, that fairly-well describes this organization. Everything this 
</I>&gt;<i> project does is publicly archived; anyone may join; most everyone uses 
</I>&gt;<i> their real name. There is nothing hidden and no one excluded. Sounds pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> transparent.
</I>
Likewise for Votorola.  Likewise for any open project.  But that's not
what I mean by transparency.  I mean transparency out in the
&quot;ecosystem&quot;, as Mark Murphy calls it, of all projects.  That ecosystem
needs to be free and open too.  Making it so, and keeping it so, is
going to require transparency - knowing what's out there, and how it
all relates.

&gt;<i> But I do agree that it would be great to have a larger API where other 
</I>&gt;<i> views can interoperate. This project certainly has the right name (ie, 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;meta&quot;) to enable that. If you want some server space or something to work 
</I>&gt;<i> on it, I'm sure we can help.
</I>
Thank you!  (Votorola will help, too.)

&gt;<i> I am busy today and honestly haven't had time to read through your entire 
</I>&gt;<i> explanation. But FWIW, from this group session at Transparency camp, I hope 
</I>&gt;<i> to get a meta-organization of electronic democracy groups going, at least 
</I>&gt;<i> as a separate list server if not more.
</I>
(I'll wait to hear what you propose.)

Just to clarify: My own proposal isn't for an organization.  It's for
a simple clearing-house that is unaffiliated with any organization or
project.  It has no staff, no authority, no budget, etc.  Its purpose
is to list and track standards in a fair and open way, so that all of
us - tech and non-tech alike - can see the range of choices on offer,
and get a sense of what's coming.  It doesn't matter where the
standards come from, or who rubber-stamps them - all will be listed.

Critique?  Counter-proposals?  Or is it too early?  Should we butt
heads a while longer.  (No problem, I'm hard-headed. ;)
