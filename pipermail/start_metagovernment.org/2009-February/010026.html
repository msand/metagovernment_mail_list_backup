<PRE>Hello together,

I have participated at the meeting last weekend but was not part of that list 
so this had to change. First I want to introduce myself.

I am from Austria and started a page presenting my ideas at 
<A HREF="http://www.opentution.org">http://www.opentution.org</A> which has the same goal as metagovernment. The idea 
for the platform came after the european constitution got rejected by the 
french and dutch people four years ago which started a lot of discussion about 
it. The main complaint at that time was that the constituion was developed 
with the people excluded. With that I realised that there is actually no 
possibility to take part in a development process for laws and thought that 
maybe the use of open source technics in this area could solve that problem.

My goal now is to implement such a system for austrian politics in the way 
that people first make proposals independently of the government and then if 
the proposals are good enough and accepted by a broad band of people from the 
platform the document will be sent to the government. My hope is that 
governments accept the proposals because of the good quality this kind of 
system will produce. Reason comes from the good quality of Wikipedia.

The Metagovernment project seems to move along very well and therefore I want 
to take part by bringing in my ideas. I can also offer you to include the UI 
from <A HREF="http://www.opentution.org">http://www.opentution.org</A> for Metagovernment as a starting point. 

Regards,
Gerold
