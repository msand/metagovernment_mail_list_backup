I was playing with it.  It's the first app I've seen that uses
federated Google Accounts.  It's a nice stepping stone, till OpenID
catches on.

My impressions as a user - just the things that hit me first:

   i) Confusion over the difference between a Position and a Policy.
      Both *sound* rather concrete, but I suspect that a Position is a
      somewhat abstract or general goal, wheras a Policy is supposed
      to be a particular action.

  ii) Impatience with the chore of rating abstract Issues, Values and
      Positions.  Why does it want to know (the user wonders)?  If it
      needs that info, then can't it be *induced* from the votes I
      place on particular, concrete questions (Policies, I guess).

      Anyway, it's only the concrete actions that I (user) care about.

And these are just quibbles:

 iii) Clicking on Postion(&quot;Tax Carbon&quot;), I can't see the vote tally
      until after I vote.  It's annoying that it hides this
      information from me.

  iv) I can't see how many people have voted, only the proportions.
      So there's no way to judge the extent/strength of consensus or
      dissensus.  (Should be easy to fix.)

&gt;<i> I'm working on a list of development priorities for our next (rapid)
</I>&gt;<i> iteration, and would appreciate any help or input this group can provide.
</I>&gt;<i> We've included a &quot;feedback&quot; button throughout the site, which allows for
</I>&gt;<i> easy page-specific suggestions.  Any comments you'd like to share with this
</I>&gt;<i> group are welcome here.
</I>
Anway, congrats!  You're only the second app to go beta.  The leaders
out of the starting gate are both commercial.  The open projects are
trailing:

Folks - please correct me if you see any errors, there.  Please fill
in the blanks for DeepDebate and Continuous Democracy, if you know
them.

Best,
