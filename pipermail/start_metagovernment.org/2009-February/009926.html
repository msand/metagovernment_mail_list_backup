<PRE>The reasons to organize more formally are more broad than just choosing a
leader, or agreeing on a leadership structure. We need to set a budget --
what are our fiscal requirements? How do we expect these to change over
time? What other requirements do we need, such as a paid programming staff
or server admin? and, how do we decide which requirements are necessary? If
we were to get funding, how would we decide on allocation? Who would process
forms, etc?

We should try to tackle these problems, we need to tackle these problems. If
we can use the metascore interface to tackle them, great!! but if we can't,
we need to find a way to tackle them so that we can build the metascore
interface to handle them.

I would say, the first step, rather than discuss leadership, is to make a
list of such requirements that a formal organization is meant to solve.
then, try to solve them. Solving them -- even without determining
membership, could be sufficient.

we will likely want to set these requirements/budgets/etc separately for
metascore and metagovernment, since the aims are somewhat different.

thoughts?
