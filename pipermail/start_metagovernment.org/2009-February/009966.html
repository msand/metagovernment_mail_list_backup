Yes, though &quot;API&quot; probably wasn't the right technical metaphor for what
I have in mind.

&gt;<i> Do you have a more complete design sketch?
</I>
In my noggin, yes. Written down, not in any comprehensive, coherent
form. I am trying to scrape together the time to tackle that project.
However, I've also started up a firm related to application development
on the Android platform, and it's taking up a goodly chunk of my time.

&gt;<i> Your 9 principles are
</I>&gt;<i> pretty solid.  I'm thinking that you have something practical in mind.
</I>
There's two tiers: principles and practice.

Do I intend to offer up something practical? Yes. However, I'm less
concerned about my technical solution being adopted than I am about the
principles being refined and used as a tool to validate whatever &quot;killer
app&quot; arises.

I will say this: it is my fervent hope that the &quot;killer app&quot; will be
less of an implementation and more of a set of standards backed by
implementations (plural). To draw an analogy, Disqus has a fair number
of blogs using them for blog comments and a decent amount of buzz...and
Disqus has zero chance of being a &quot;killer app&quot; the way RSS feeds were.
It's not that Disqus is bad, but Disqus does not create an ecosystem and
so its growth is limited by its own ability to sell.

&gt;<i> If not, then what is the practical obstacle, do you think?  Why has
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;killer app&quot; not been coded?
</I>
Perhaps it exists but hasn't reached critical mass yet to get on
anyone's radar. Perhaps the folk who might implement it were focused in
recent years on other applications (e.g., stuff for the US Presidential
election). Perhaps they're all off building those flying cars we all
have been waiting for. ;-)

In other words, I can cook up a bunch of theories for why it doesn't yet
exist, and those theories would all be merely wild guesses.
