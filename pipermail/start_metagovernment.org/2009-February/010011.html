<PRE>In the mailing list from the freedom foundation it was brought up that
the wiki being public is not the best medium to discuss the
technicalities of the next FP7 proposal. Mostly because other groups
who are competeing with us might steal ideas. I know that in general
the metagovernment position is: you cannot steal something that we
want to give you for free. But this is unfortunately not the position
from the other partners in the list. So what do would you suggest to
do?

Can we white list that page so that only logged in users can read it?

Do you see any other option?

I consider the support to this group to be really important, to the
point that if I am forced to chose I would give up the application
process and retain the group. I think the future is with open
collaborative process. But maybe it is possible to find a workable
compromise that although not making one totally happy does not make
anyone fully unhappy.

Please let me know what you think,
Pietro
