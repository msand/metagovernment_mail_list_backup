<PRE>I also signed up as a sponsor today, and booked airfare to DC.  Deb Bryant,
another DemocracyLab board member with Oregon State's Open Source Lab, will
also be there.  I'd be happy to participate in the Metagovernment session.
It's possible I'll add another session too.  I've thought of two topics,
either a case study describing our project with Oregon 150
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.oregon150.org/projects/youth-legacy/">http://www.oregon150.org/projects/youth-legacy/</A>&gt;  or a session on
values-focused &lt;<A HREF="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/KEEVAL.html">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/KEEVAL.html</A>&gt;  thinking,
describing how we're applying these principles in DemocracyLab (though we
weren't familiar with Keeney's work at the time of inception). 
 
Ed, it'll be great to meet you in person and to spend time with so many of
like mind.  I'm looking forward to it!

OK, despite our current budget of approximately zero... the Metagovernment
project is now a sponsor of Transparency Camp. In other words, I'll be
attending. :)

I notice DemocracyLab is a sponsor as well. Are you going, Mark? I added
myself to the presenter list:
<A HREF="https://barcamp.pbwiki.com/Tcamp-Sessions">https://barcamp.pbwiki.com/Tcamp-Sessions</A>
but if you or someone else form your project will be there, maybe we should
present together...?

That is a 30 minute bus/train ride from me. While attendance is sold out, I
could still go as a sponsor for $50. My only issue (other than the $50)
being that I may be out of town that weekend for a business trip. I will
however look into that and see if I can make it. It does seem like it would
be helpful to have us represented there.
 
I had been looking at Government 2.0 Camp:
<A HREF="http://www.barcamp.org/Government20Camp">http://www.barcamp.org/Government20Camp</A>
which is also sold out, but Transparency Camp seems a little more on-point
for us.

I learned today about Transparency

t=&amp;affiliate=&amp;eventpassword=&gt;  Camp taking place in DC in a couple of weeks.
The event is full, but the attendee list looks like a who's who of the open
government/virtual democracy movement.  It's possible to sign up to find out
about the next event, which I did.  It's encouraging to see that there
appear to be hundreds of people working towards the goals we share.
