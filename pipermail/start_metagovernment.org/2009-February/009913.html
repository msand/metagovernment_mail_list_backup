<PRE>Hi Robert,

I'd just like to point out the irony in your post. You're asking us to be more
active but you yourself aren't committing to be active, even though you
could probably make some valuable contributions to metascore. The project
isn't a top down company, so it's absurd to ask of Ed to tell us what to do.
It's bottom up, which means that if you think the project isn't doing well,
it's every individual participants fault.

Concerning metascore I would certainly like to be more active, but like most
I have other things going on, especially with exams coming up. You mentioned
a few areas where non programmers could be more active and I agree. We
shouldn't wait on metascore before we start promoting our ideas. A formal
organization is probably a good idea, since other organizations would take us
more seriously. Having some software to show would also help but we
shouldn't let it stop us.

Again for everybody lurking on the list. If you think as strong about
the project
as Robert, take a moment to consider how you could contribute and how you
could find the time to make that contribution. The success of metagovernment
depends on you, and your engagement.


Manuel
