<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Dear Ed, thank you very much for your proposal!
And Thanks to all the others who voted in favour of it already!
I was really hoping, that Metagovernment could develop towards such a 
Meta-Project. :-)

Through the communication in this list I began to discover more and more 
the common grounds I share with Michael Allen and the Votorola-Project.
Our exchange has deepened off-list and meanwhile I see myself now as 
both: a member of Votorola and a member of Metagovernment.

As a member of Metagovernment I would like to say:

I&#180;m looking foreward to contribute to the coordination group. Finally 
some things I as a non-developer can do.
Now, for me the question arises: Provided Ed&#180;s proposal reaches 
consensus, how do we approach the other projects with our plan of 
establishing this group?

I think it would be best if all projects found this group together.
That we inform them of our idea and formally invite them to participate 
in the founding.

In particular (and besides the voting-technology) we as Metagovernment 
have to offer:

- the wiki-pages
- the discussion list
- and the name &quot;Metagovernment&quot;


As a member of Votorola I would answer:

Halleluja! Thank you for your offer!
I am looking foreward to our teamwork.
And I like the name &quot;Metagovernment&quot; for this coordination project. For 
the sound of it and because it is connected with some recognition 
already and because it has partially been functioning as a Meta-group 
anyway.


What do you think?

With best regards,
Thomas

</I>&gt;<i> While many people in this project share a common vision for Metascore,

</I>&gt;<i> many online governance projects, this group is already well on its way  
</I>&gt;<i> to being the coordinating group for all of those projects, as is  
</I>&gt;<i> emerging in:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I would like to propose that the original software development  
</I>&gt;<i> group continue as the Metascore project, and the larger group of  
</I>&gt;<i> groups be called the Metagovernment project. This &quot;new&quot; group would  
</I>&gt;<i> not be as much of a formal organization as a &quot;tribe&quot; or coordination  
</I>&gt;<i> group, where all the great ideas of the various projects can be  
</I>&gt;<i> bounced off each other and promoted together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not meant to in any way diminish the great work we've done on  
</I>&gt;<i> Metascore. I still think that its focus on a distributed model and a  
</I>&gt;<i> consensus-through-synthesis mechanism probably is the way to go. But  
</I>&gt;<i> there is no reason why this open, global group can't embrace all the  
</I>&gt;<i> other projects as well, and let Metascore benefit from that  
</I>&gt;<i> coordination effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be a coordination group, we would have to revisit the Basic  
</I>&gt;<i> Principles. I would suggest that we make the first two principles the  
</I>&gt;<i> Basic Principles, while the next two would remain with the Metascore  
</I>&gt;<i> project but become Suggested Principles for the Metagovernment project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Mission statement would remain similar... perhaps something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to promote the  
</I>&gt;<i> development and use of software which can act as the primary  
</I>&gt;<i> governance mechanism of any community.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> And I think the Vision statement would not change very much at all.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would also have to do some re-writing of the website to make it  
</I>&gt;<i> more inclusive of the diversity of projects we'd like to encompass  
</I>&gt;<i> (using NationBuilder, Vilfredo, Votorola, DemocracyLab, and  
</I>&gt;<i> Telemetrics Freedom as the basis for defining the expanded group). I  
</I>&gt;<i> would also suggest that we revisit the word &quot;open source governance&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> and try for something a little broader... perhaps just &quot;open  
</I>&gt;<i> governance&quot; or &quot;online governance.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While there would be a lot of work involved... it would be work that  
</I>&gt;<i> we *all* could do. The current project is hampered by reliance on  
</I>&gt;<i> overtaxed developers to come up with software which can take us to the  
</I>&gt;<i> next level. Meanwhile, there are a lot of other people who want to  
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to the project but don't have the means/ability/time to  
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to the code. If we re-form as the coordinating group, there  
</I>&gt;<i> are suddenly lots of tasks that many people can perform, such as:
</I>&gt;<i> - re-thinking and re-writing the website (which involves a lot of sub- 
</I>&gt;<i> tasks, including the above)
</I>&gt;<i> - inviting more projects into the fold
</I>&gt;<i> - working on the particulars of inter-project coordination (which has  
</I>&gt;<i> many sub-tasks)
</I>&gt;<i> - outreach and promotion to small communities (to adopt *any* of the  
</I>&gt;<i> group's softwares)
</I>&gt;<i> - continuing the great philosophy, discussion, and brainstorming that  
</I>&gt;<i> has been conducted on this list
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is just a first blush suggestion. Please reply and discuss what  
</I>&gt;<i> you think of this idea. In accordance with the history of this  
</I>&gt;<i> project, we would need broad consent and consensus to go forward with  
</I>&gt;<i> this change. I am a little short on time right now, so haven't put any  
</I>&gt;<i> of this on the wiki, but for the moment it would make sense to just  
</I>&gt;<i> discuss it here and summarize there as the conversation develops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i>
