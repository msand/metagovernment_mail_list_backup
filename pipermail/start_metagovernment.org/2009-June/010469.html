<PRE>Thank you Christopher.
The chat with you are always very interesting.

Let me add that on VgtA a session does not last a single generation.
In other word, one of the &quot;KEY&quot; (sorry for the caps) elements of
Vilfredo is that you go through several generations, where the same
ideas are cooked over and over, while people try to integrate them one
with the other. To have that we need people committed to go through
the whole process of writing and voting a few times. The only time
where we really had it going was between me and Chris at the
beginning. Part of that was because we were really involved (we were
deciding what to do in the summer). If you can spare 120 seconds I
invite you to read the history of this question:
<A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=12">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=12</A>

At the first generation the ideas where:
1-Go to a festival;
2-Let us admit it. Summer in the UK sucks, so Chris should come to
Coimbra and help me build the house in an ecological way with a
permaculture garden. Bringing if she wants to come, his girlfriend.
3-go to a buddhafield camp together
4-Go camping
5-Go to a Go tournament
6-Go to a Tai Chi retreat
7-Pietro needs to make a long trip from Italy to Coimbra, bringing all
the stuff, and maybe Chris would like to travel with him.
8-go to the european go meeting in sweden for 2 weeks

Of those the winners were:
1-Go to a festival
2-Let us admit it. Summer in the UK sucks, so Chris should come to
Coimbra and help me build the house in an ecological way with a
permaculture garden. Bringing if she wants to come, his girlfriend.
3-go to a buddhafield camp together

Now look how those basic ideas got integrated:

Generation 2
1-In June/July/August, Chris and Jenny come to Coimbra. Together with
Pietro, we plant seeds, sit in deckchairs and pretend to sword-fight.
We drink hard spirits and swap war stories into the early hours, while
the sun goes down and back up again.
2-Let us admit it. Summer in the UK sucks, so Chris should come to
Coimbra and help me build the house in an ecological way with a
permaculture garden. Bringing if she wants to come, his girlfriend. We
would have also internet, so Chris can bring some work, if he wants.
3-There is a really cool community on the south of Coimbra, we should
go there for one week. They work a lot with the green, and with
interpersonal relations. All the person that live there have made a
COMMITMENT not to leave for 5 years.
4-Go to a festival
5-go to a buddhafield camp together
6-Let us admit it. Summer in the UK sucks, so Chris should come to
Coimbra and help me build the house in an ecological way with a
permaculture garden. Bringing if she wants to come, his girlfriend.
7-Go to a festival together, in particular to the buddhafield one.
8-We got to Buddhafields together, do lots of tai chi and chi gung,
and we play with Duffs circus toys. We sip non-alcoholic drinks into
the wee hours, along with a few bottles of cider we smuggled in.

Of those the winners were:
1- In June/July/August, Chris and Jenny come to Coimbra. Together with
Pietro, we plant seeds, sit in deckchairs and pretend to sword-fight.
We drink hard spirits and swap war stories into the early hours, while
the sun goes down and back up again.
2-Let us admit it. Summer in the UK sucks, so Chris should come to

3-There is a really cool community on the south of Coimbra, we should

Often someone will endorse an idea just to ignore it on the next
generation, when it is competing with much better ideas. Essentially
this is a work that goes through various partial approximation.

By now the general mood has been set, and what remains to fill in are
the details. Which is what we do in the next generation:

Generation 3:
1) In June/July/August, Chris and Jenny come to Coimbra. Together with
Pietro, we help work on the house to make it more
ecologically-friendly, and start making a permaculture garden. We also
sit in deckchairs, pretend to sword-fight, drink hard spirits, and
swap war stories into the early hours, while the sun goes down and
back up again. We also go to a really cool community south of Coimbra,
and meet the people working on green issues and interpersonal
relations.
2): In June/July/August, Chris and Jenny come to Coimbra. Together
with Pietro, we plant seeds, sit in deckchairs and pretend to
sword-fight. We drink hard spirits and swap war stories into the early
hours, while the sun goes down and back up again. Also there we visit
for one week the really cool community on the south of Coimbra, we
should go there for one week. They work a lot with the green, and with
interpersonal relations. All the person that live there have made a
COMMITMENT not to leave for 5 years. And regarding the work above,
Chris will bring with himself some work, and Pietro will have to work
at the Uni, but we shall take some time off, maybe one day every 2 to
work on the house, and in the garden. Ah, Chris should bring his
really cool book about renovating the earth.
3) In June/July/August, Chris and Jenny come to Coimbra. Together with
Pietro, we plant seeds, sit in deckchairs and pretend to sword-fight.
We drink hard spirits and swap war stories into the early hours, while
the sun goes down and back up again.
4) Let us admit it. Summer in the UK sucks, so Chris should come to
Coimbra and help me build the house in an ecological way with a
permaculture garden. Bringing if she wants to come, his girlfriend. We
would have also internet, so Chris can bring some work, if he wants.
5) There is a really cool community on the south of Coimbra, we should
go there for one week. They work a lot with the green, and with
interpersonal relations. All the person that live there have made a
COMMITMENT not to leave for 5 years. Endorsed Ignored
6) go to a buddhafield camp together


And the winner are the first two, which are essentially two version of
the same idea:
Chris comes down to Coimbra, he brings his gf, each does his work, we
visit this community, and we also work in the house and generally
enjoy each other company.


This is more than just a brainstorming session.

I find the discussion about the banking crises,
<A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=16">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=16</A>
and about the meaning of life
<A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=14">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=14</A>
to be equally interesting.

The great limit I feel was that the people participating were always
changing, which made finding a stable solution impossible.
(It might become possible if the community becomes so populated that
essentially every point of view is always represented). In any case I
hope I have partially avoided this problem by adding the necessity for
users to write their email, and the fact that the system sends you an
email, if you need to vote or write on a question you have been
involved in the past.

Cheers,
Pietro
