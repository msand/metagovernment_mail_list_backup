Without getting technical and putting everybody to sleep, here's a
link from the user's perspective:

  <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization#Free_Range_Voting">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization#Free_Range_Voting</A>

Whatever design (architecture) would allow participants to range
freely across the Internet, from site to site, without leaving behind
their accumulated work (proposals, votes, and so forth) - that's maybe
a good definition to start.

But also, add whatever it takes (technically) for the participants to
use that freedom, not just to choose sites that are better than
others, but also to weave multiple sites and multiple projects
together into a fabric of services that's stronger than any single
site could offer.  In other words, something like you and Pietro spoke
of here:

  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-May/001494.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-May/001494.html</A>

Does anybody know the technical jargon for this?  I'm not sure, so I
just call it by the general term &quot;open architecture&quot;.

More to Ed's point (as I take it), can anybody think of an example
where an application domain (like e-democracy) has been opened up to
the network in this way?  The only ones that come to mind are either
too narrow in scope (list archiving sites, monetizing mash-ups,
OpenID) or too wide (Internet itself).

On the other hand, I can't think of any domain in which the demands
for openess in everything are likely to be quite so intense, insistent
and impossible to defy as in e-democracy.  If I don't bury my head in
the sand, I can't foresee any technical response to those demands
other than an open architecture, and I can't foresee any social
response other than an open society.  I think some of us are feeling,
we can't have the one without the other.  What do you think?
