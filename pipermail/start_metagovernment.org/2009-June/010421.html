<PRE>I fully support this. I've had the feeling for a while now, that
people may be seeing the software as a prerequisite for
metagovernment. Emphasizing that they are separate could focus efforts
on promotion of open governance.

I'm not too optimistic that we are ready for standardization effort. I
have the impression that in most technologies there has to be a period
of dispersed competing development before the community can see what a
standard should look like and I'm not sure we are past that point yet.

Open Social emerged after myspace, facebook and many others I can't be
bothered to name, just as an example that was mentioned here.

Standardization may help the different projects with collaboration
though, so I may be wrong. The only way I can see this happening
though, is if each project sees a concrete way in which they can
complement each other. There has to be existing software and good idea
of how they can interface.

Overlooking all the projects we may be in a good position to see and
promote such opportunities.
