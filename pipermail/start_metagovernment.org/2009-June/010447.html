<PRE>As Jacki said, open source governance ideas go global, but  
implementation is better suited locally. I've reading the law  
(unpleasant task) about non-profit organizations in Argentina, I have  
both: good and bad news. Conforming the group of the first kind...  
mounting one costs around 90 dollars (plus some time, at least seven  
founders, and a lawyer&#8212;I'm trying to get one for free), and it can be  
legally related to similar foreign non-profit's (yes, we can have an  
international web of them). The bad news is the archaic conception of  
'civil organization' here, it seems made for neighborhood sportive &amp;  
social clubs (you need to relate the organization to a physical  
place, for example). But well, nothing that bad.

I speculate with forming one as soon as possible; so, it can be  
presented at Wikimania (along the new truly meta-project air of  
Metagovernment). As we've said, a non-profit will surround the  
movement with a lot of seriousness.

Ed, the ads are under design, but we'll reach them to you for  
uploading to the wiki.

Thanks Juan for explaining the importance of aiming to the University  
sector here.

Also I met a guy nicknamed Maiqui &#8212;via another friend&#8212; who was  
already planing to constitute an open university party. Physical ads  
will help to find us each other. There are more people thinking like  
us out-there, just not seeing us in Internet for a manifold of  
reasons. (I remember finding Metagovernment googling, (even) when it  
was a project on Sourceforge.) One of them maybe a very soft use of  
the Internet; the ads are going to tackle this down.

Mat&#237;as
