I got the same advert.  It looks like MixedInk was actually chosen by
the OGI for phase III.  I didn't know until I saw this post:

  <A HREF="http://lists.thataway.org/scripts/wa-THATAWAY.exe?A2=ind0906D&amp;L=NCDD-DISCUSSION&amp;T=0&amp;O=D&amp;P=5160">http://lists.thataway.org/scripts/wa-THATAWAY.exe?A2=ind0906D&amp;L=NCDD-DISCUSSION&amp;T=0&amp;O=D&amp;P=5160</A>

It's a good technical choice.  MixedInk is only system that uses P2P
recombinant text (aside from Votorola, still in alpha) and there's no
other way to scale the collaborative drafting (my opinion).  Their
only problem is the mass voting system.  I bet you anything they'll
soon be replacing it with a P2P voting system.  Then they'll shift to
a higher gear.  Although they're closed and commercial, they could
still win in the short term (like 5 years).

BTW: here's another commercial project (in a different field) that's
doing an end run around an open project that wasn't *quite* open
enough:

  <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/visiblegovernment-discuss/browse_thread/thread/87b8b0a7d7659d72">http://groups.google.com/group/visiblegovernment-discuss/browse_thread/thread/87b8b0a7d7659d72</A>

Suppose you guys in Metagov are successful in getting the open
projects to work together, as proposed.  Do you see us moving fast
enough (together) to beat MixedInk?  Do you see us targeting them and
chasing them down?

(I'm not trying to influence your decision, just to share info and
 ideas.  If it's only a technical race, we can beat MixedInk in the
 course of a month.)
