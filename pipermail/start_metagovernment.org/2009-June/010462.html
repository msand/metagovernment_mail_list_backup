<PRE>I agree with Owen,

Data needs to be open and based on open public standards to be completely
transparent. Even &quot;closed&quot; software like SAP's ERP apps support open public
standards. It is the format of the data that helps to create transparency
not so much the software.

All to often I see a focus on open software instead of the best software to
address the requirements. Open is not synonymous with best.

I guess they'll be trying to export better query interfaces at some point.
No way of judging the difficulty, without a look under the hood.  But just
the fact of being closed is going to hurt them in numerous ways.

Ideally you let the voters draft input in whatever medium *they* prefer.
I'm experimenting with providing a wiki as a default.
MediaWiki has &quot;semantic web&quot; extensions that would allow for RDF and OWL
queries on the draft texts.

I'm kind of excited about that, because we can use it to distribute all
sorts of annotations and other meta-data out to the users.  So they can do
their own titling and classification of issues, for example.  And MediaWiki
has a familiar interface (from Wikipedia), and tons of extensions and
user-developed scripts.  I don't see how MixedInk can compete with that kind
of openness.

(I wish MediaWiki was easier to install.  The admins will have a tough  time
of it.)
