I think it sounds OK.  Offhand I see no technical problems.  I'm
pretty sure we'll need multiple authentication methods (and variants
of each) for different purposes, and I bet we'll often want to combine
them too - similar to showing 3 pieces of ID - for particular
authentication tasks.

I guess none of that can happen, though, without an open architecture.
I agree with Thomas (and Owen too, I think) that the openness ought to
extend across projects, organizations, etc.  So all of this seems to
be pointing to a networked architecture.

It's almost like the technical questions are kind of boring, because
they are relatively easy to answer.  They don't seem to be the bone of
contention, anyway.  I feel it's more difficult to answer Thomas.
