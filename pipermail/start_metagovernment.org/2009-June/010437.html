<PRE>Today Juan &#193;lvarez, his girlfriend Sof&#237;a and I met for a chat and a  
coffee, somewhere in Buenos Aires. It was a productive encounter,  
since we defined a plan to promote Open Source Governance (OSG). The  
lack of non-experimental collaborative decision-maker website makes  
us to aim specifically at big Universities, rather than the general  
society. More contributors are needed, and we assume better  
probabilities of finding them in the higher education ambient.

THE STRATEGY

To place physical banners at the important Universities across the  
country, that redirect to the project's page. They are made in Buenos  
Aires and sent in packages to familiars, friends and contacts of  
other cities. We desire a wide coverage, and shall use a network to  
achieve it.


THE AD

It's an optical disk (CD or DVD) with a stencil graffiti over the  
write/read-able surface. Its geometrical form distincts it from the  
cumulus of other political ads, that always are rectangular. The  
rainbow shinning calls for attention. It promotes  
www.metagobierno.org with a succinct slogan. (Please, help us to find  
one: <A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=38.">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=38.</A>)

Over the non-write/read-able side goes an adhesive layer protected by  
a removable film. This is to facilitate the task of placing the  
banners in walls.

To get disks cheaply we want to implement a recycling program: to  
give away a new disk in change of three used ones, for example.

We are going to produce the banners with money from us... Argentinean  
peso is devaluated, one dolar equals four pesos and one euro, five.  
So, small (but really useful) aids coming form the members of this  
list will be happily accepted.


THE PAGE

It's the Spanish Metagovernment version of the wiki, plus a  
university activism section. There visitors are encouraged to  
participate in the meta-project and/or projects, promote the  
political philosophy and support the movement. And when OSG tools are  
ready, to form open University political parties and gain control  
over Student Centres and Directive Commissions (dummy executives that  
follows stakeholders' decisions). If this happen in at least one  
Faculty of one University, the spread of this form of government over  
most of the higher educational institutions of the country (and some  
publicity as well) is straight forward. Then the society may know a  
possible political zenith.


THE NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION

We think to fund one (within a year?) and relate it to an account to  
receive money from national and foreign supporters. SMS donation  
seems attractive, and of course, all others paid methods such as  
PayPal will be adopted. Argentina has good and achievable human  
resources and infrastructure for IT, programmers will be hired to  
boost the developing of OSG software, and maybe we can have our own  
free hosting service for OSG projects. Also assistance &#8212;in the  
broader sense&#8212; to open organizations (such as open Student Centers)  
will be given.

Thanks for having read this huge mail. Recommendations?
