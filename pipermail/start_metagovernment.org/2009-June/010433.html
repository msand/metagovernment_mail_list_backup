<PRE>Ed &amp; Kris' comments are good.  However, they don't yet sufficiently answer
Thomas' question: &quot;how do we approach the other projects with our plan of
establishing this group?&quot;

 

It seems to me the first requirement is to ensure we have substantial
consensus on a &quot;plan&quot; that is pretty explicit about what we are trying to do
and the second requirement is to identify and establish communications with
other groups trying to do similar things, to see if some degree of consensus
is possible on how each respective effort might complement and reinforce the
others.

 

In support of those purposes, it would be good if each of the groups were
documenting their goals and objectives in readily shareable, referenceable
format on the Web.  To the degree that each group may document its mission,
vision, value, goals, objectives, and stakeholders in any format on the Web,
I will be happy to render their plans in StratML format for inclusion in our
collection at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other</A> 

 

BTW, one of my observations from having converted more than 500 plans to
StratML format is that most organizations do a relatively poor job of
identifying their stakeholders.  It is hard to see how they can communicate
well with them without first having identified them.

Hi,

I agree with Ed.

I had made the following post in the OSTP Blog on: 

Wrap-Up
&lt;<A HREF="http://blog.ostp.gov/2009/06/10/wrap-up-of-the-open-government-brainstormin">http://blog.ostp.gov/2009/06/10/wrap-up-of-the-open-government-brainstormin</A>

Transparency:

Access to Information 


Enhancing Citizen Participation in Decision-Making


&quot;I feel use of an open source e-Communication platform to integrate the
entire vertical and horizontal hierarchy of government and governance from
the national level to the last local level on one hand and citizens on the
other hand for seamless G2G and G2C communications / transactions and making
them transparent to the citizens through web and permitting them to vote for
or against or comment on a 10 point scale using the web / phone could help
in ensuring transparency and accountability&quot;.

I am not sure if this is relevant to the discussions we are having in Meta
Government.

In order to avoid causing that effect, it is important first to be pretty
clear about what it is that we are aiming to do and for whom we aim to do
it.

 

My first stab would be to say that the aims are:
- To promote the use of internet technologies to supplement and/or supplant
representative democracies, with the aim of vastly increasing citizens'
input into the communities to which they belong.
- To facilitate and coordinate thoughts, efforts, and (when possible)
technologies among different projects working toward the above.

and the stakeholders are:
- Those involved in developing governance software
- Those wishing to contribute to the effort to open governance through
software
- (later) Anyone who wishes to participate in the governance of any
community
