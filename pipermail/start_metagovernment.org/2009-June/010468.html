<PRE>All of this talk about money and politics has left me wondering what we're
trying to create, exactly.

Pietro and I recently chatted about this in relation to Pareto. From the
perspective of the User Experience, I believe that Pietro is working on
something similar to a brainstorming session, where everyone stands up and
shouts out ideas, giving all in attendance the opportunity to respond to
those ideas. In my experience, a second session is required whereby everyone
looks at the ideas presented in the first session and rates them according
to their own personal priorities.

This is a wonderful usability model, but I'm not entirely clear what the
usability model is for some of the other projects on Metagovernment. Are
each of us aiming at different aspects of the decision making process, such
as primary elections, governing policies, et al? And if so, should we seek
for some basic level of interoperability to allow the user to move from the
brainstorming phases to the election phases, all the way down to the point
at which these policies are enforced?

Essentially, there are too many paths for a user to take towards an open
government, and I'm having a hard time envisioning this so that I can
contribute something of value from my own bag o' skills.

And on that note, I started a brainstorming session on Pareto just to get an
idea of all the different ways a citizen can interact with their government
on the web:
