I completely agree with Ed.

Mainly, I see that the attention gets diverted from the main focus of the
metascore software on the metagovernment list. I love to read the e-mails
with opinions from everybody around the globe, but what matters is that we
get something tangible.

And even though I'd die to be able to read every mail, my day activities
don't allow me to keep up. To be honest, I'm more interested in discussing
about the metascore project than the high level philosophical discussions
that usually happen in the list. I'm not saying that's wrong at all, of
course, just that makes me loose interest in some cases.

Pietro, I agree with your point of view. However, we should also think of
the greater good and forget a little bit about our natural tendency to gain
personal recognition. Also, I've noticed that in Open Source software
projects, most of the users don't think of who developed the project but the
project itself. With some exceptions, the Linux kernel being the big one.
Still, I can probably name 5 or 10 kernel developers (nothing compared to
the thousands of people that may have written code for the kernel but still,
it's better).

I think leadership is natural to human behavior and necessary in every
community. And that's the main point I beleive we are failing to see and to
boost in metagovernment/metascore (but I'm going off-topic there).

Probably I'm just missing how open governance could help decentralize power
and start thinking about more equal leader-less communities. Just sound a
little unnatural at this point, but it may be the status-quo playing tricks
on my mind...

Thanks,

Juan
