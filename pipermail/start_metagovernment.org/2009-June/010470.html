Please consider this more thoroughly.

For example, did you read the MIxedInk's Terms of Service, for this
effects &lt;i&gt;your long-term&lt;/i&gt; ability to &quot;share the data efficiently
and effectively&quot;?  Consider the following paragraph (reformatted to
emphasize just how much you're giving away to a commercial entity
whose ethics, values, principles, motives are unstated):

&quot;By submitting any information or material (a &quot;Submission&quot;) to the
Site or to MixedInk[..] you thereby expressly grant, or warrant that
the owner [you] of such material has expressly granted MixedInk,

1. a royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive
right and license,
2. to use, make and have made, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
translate and distribute such material (in whole or in part),
3. worldwide,  AND
4. to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology
5. now known or hereafter [ever] developed

 ...subject to our Privacy Policy, as available on the Site.&quot;

In other words, they get all the rights to all the benefits of your
submissions (minus, of course, any eventual benefit to democracy), and
YOU get to have all the responsibility for them:

...you are solely responsible for the accuracy, completeness and
truthfulness of any information and materials that you submit or
provide to us and for ensuring that you have the necessary rights to
submit such information and materials for use by us.&quot;

To be fair, do note the following paragraph (emphasis mine):

&quot;MixedInk *may* permit anyone to access and freely copy your
submissions to the Site under a Creative Commons Share-Alike
Attribution 3.0 License (the &quot;Creative Commons License&quot;).

MixedInk may grant a license (the &quot;Proprietary License&quot;) to republish
your submissions to the Organizer of the topics to which you
contribute. When a Proprietary License is used, the Organizer may be
granted the right to determine how your Submissions are published and
may elect *not* to attribute your Submissions directly to you.&quot;

[Ed Pastore]
&gt;<i> Personally I think that democracy and money don't mix. Once there's a
</I>&gt;<i> profit motive, there's an avenue for corruption on some level.
</I>
This is an interesting topic, but I would point out that money does
not necessarily imply profit.  Currency, ideally(?) can simply be a
unit of exchange, presumably of nearly equal goods.  What currencies
provide (in contrast on barter) in theory is a buffer of time and
space (taking place within a &quot;market&quot;) to more efficiently match up
buyers and sellers over time....

BTW, Will be interesting to consider the ideas of a new kind of global
currency not tied to any particular state.  Consider, for example,
tying the economic system to the real world using something like gold
instead of a &quot;floating&quot; paper currency.  Each region could issue it's
own gold coin designs (from a fixed international and audited standard
of size and denomination) which are traded freely as regular coinage
and bills.  Wouldn't it be cool to have coins designed (and minted
presumably) from other countries (say like Namibia) finding their way
into your pocket, useable like every other, raising global geographic
as well as cultural awareness?
