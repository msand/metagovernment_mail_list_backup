<PRE>I'm not extremely concerned about how to approach other groups, as we  
have already attracted several. People from Votorola, Vilfredo,  
Telemetrics, and Metascore have voiced support for the proposal. And I  
believe those from NationBuilder and DemocracyLab would also be  
interested, judging by their past participation in this list. And then  
we also historically have had interest from several other groups as  
listed on the Related Projects page. Once we have a large handful of  
such groups, their mere presence should help attract others. (Though  
of course we should actively reach out to others.)

As for a plan, I think we have a good start at <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization/Proposal_2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization/Proposal_2</A> 
  and would invite you and others to expand/refine it as you can.  
There are many sub-projects which will need to be tackled as we start  
to expand on that plan.

Concerning identifying stakeholders, it seems a bit strange in our  
case. We can rightly claim that eventually our beneficiary- 
stakeholders will be every single human being on the planet (and  
perhaps other intelligences as well).

But concerning participation, I think there are basically two kinds of  
stakeholders:
- those actively, formally involved in the creation of governance  
software
- others who wish to be involved in the overall process, promotion,  
etc. but are not currently involved in a specific project.
We need the resulting organization to be able to allow effective  
communication among members of the first group without having it  
swamped by members of the second. Yet, being an inherently inclusive  
group, we need to do that in such a way that members of the second  
group can contribute to the conversations of the first.

</I>&gt;<i> In support of those purposes, it would be good if each of the groups

</I>&gt;<i> BTW, one of my observations from having converted more than 500

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Ed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had made the following post in the OSTP Blog on:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wrap-Up of the Open Government Brainstorming: Participation
</I>&gt;<i> Transparency: Access to Information
</I>&gt;<i> Enhancing Citizen Participation in Decision-Making
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I feel use of an open source e-Communication platform to integrate  
</I>&gt;<i> the entire vertical and horizontal hierarchy of government and  
</I>&gt;<i> governance from the national level to the last local level on one  
</I>&gt;<i> hand and citizens on the other hand for seamless G2G and G2C  
</I>&gt;<i> communications / transactions and making them transparent to the  
</I>&gt;<i> citizens through web and permitting them to vote for or against or  
</I>&gt;<i> comment on a 10 point scale using the web / phone could help in  
</I>&gt;<i> ensuring transparency and accountability&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My first stab would be to say that the aims are:
</I>&gt;<i> - To promote the use of internet technologies to supplement and/or  
</I>&gt;<i> supplant representative democracies, with the aim of vastly  
</I>&gt;<i> increasing citizens' input into the communities to which they belong.
</I>&gt;<i> - To facilitate and coordinate thoughts, efforts, and (when  
</I>&gt;<i> possible) technologies among different projects working toward the  
</I>&gt;<i> above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and the stakeholders are:
</I>&gt;<i> - Those involved in developing governance software
</I>&gt;<i> - Those wishing to contribute to the effort to open governance  
</I>&gt;<i> through software
</I>&gt;<i> - (later) Anyone who wishes to participate in the governance of any
