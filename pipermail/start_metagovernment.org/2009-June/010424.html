<PRE>I very much agree. I work hard to get across the idea that I am not  
&quot;in charge&quot; of this project, but all of human (and pre-human) history  
is working against us in this regard. People always expect there to be  
one final leader of any effort. I found it frustrating when I was  
invited to speak in Prague last year. While I was thrilled at the  
prospect of getting to visit Europe, I tried several times to convince  
them that Manuel was at least as good as me, being the lead programmer  
and also a short train-ride away. But they wanted &quot;the founder&quot; of the  
project... even though this project is vastly different and superior  
to anything I first may have presented on this domain.

I think the best way we can get people out of this singular-leader  
mentality is for us to have multiple faces of the project. I am  
thrilled that Mat&#238;as will be representing us at Wikimania. If we can  
have several different people presenting us, hopefully people will get  
over the idea that there is one leader. That, and also if we lean more  
toward the &quot;tribe&quot; sort of terminology, instead of referring to  
ourselves as an organization.

</I>&gt;<i> and he is not a programmer. But he is really good in connecting with

</I>&gt;<i> already doing very well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also saw the video about tribes that was presented at TED some days
</I>&gt;<i> ago, and how to change the world via a tribe. I support it, although
</I>&gt;<i> it seems to me that it has a disturbing perversion where the person
</I>&gt;<i> who starts and initiate the tribe seems at the end to take the full
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledgment of all the work. Most of the work which was done by
</I>&gt;<i> others. For example, how many of you know that the Nobel that was
</I>&gt;<i> given to Al Gore was not in fact given just to Al Gore, but to him and
</I>&gt;<i> to the &quot;UN's climate panel&quot; (which I understand also includes the
</I>&gt;<i> people who made the movie an inconvenient truth). But who remembers
</I>&gt;<i> that? Even from wikipedia is not easy to find out who those people are
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. the names).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, in short, I think it is quite possible that Ed will end up at TED,
</I>&gt;<i> and my fear is that as I have a great desire to go to TED, as many of
</I>&gt;<i> us, if this becomes a tribe we see our representative go there, and we
</I>&gt;<i> be excluded. This bothers me a bit. After all this whole work is
</I>&gt;<i> coming out out of our desire to be involved in the decisions that
</I>&gt;<i> concerns us, and not to delegate them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other than for this concern, I fully support this proposal.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While many people in this project share a common vision for  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Metascore, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project might better serve the end goal of open governance by being  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a true
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meta-organization. That is: instead of being one of the many online
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance projects, this group is already well on its way to being  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> coordinating group for all of those projects, as is emerging in:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I would like to propose that the original software development  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue as the Metascore project, and the larger group of groups  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be called
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Metagovernment project. This &quot;new&quot; group would not be as much  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formal organization as a &quot;tribe&quot; or coordination group, where all  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ideas of the various projects can be bounced off each other and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> promoted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not meant to in any way diminish the great work we've done on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Metascore. I still think that its focus on a distributed model and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consensus-through-synthesis mechanism probably is the way to go.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is no reason why this open, global group can't embrace all the other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects as well, and let Metascore benefit from that coordination  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To be a coordination group, we would have to revisit the Basic  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Principles. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would suggest that we make the first two principles the Basic  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Principles,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while the next two would remain with the Metascore project but become
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Suggested Principles for the Metagovernment project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Mission statement would remain similar... perhaps something like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to promote the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use of software which can act as the primary governance mechanism  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I think the Vision statement would not change very much at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We would also have to do some re-writing of the website to make it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inclusive of the diversity of projects we'd like to encompass (using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NationBuilder, Vilfredo, Votorola, DemocracyLab, and Telemetrics  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Freedom as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the basis for defining the expanded group). I would also suggest  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revisit the word &quot;open source governance&quot; and try for something a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broader... perhaps just &quot;open governance&quot; or &quot;online governance.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While there would be a lot of work involved... it would be work  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *all* could do. The current project is hampered by reliance on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overtaxed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers to come up with software which can take us to the next  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> level.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Meanwhile, there are a lot of other people who want to contribute  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project but don't have the means/ability/time to contribute to the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we re-form as the coordinating group, there are suddenly lots of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tasks that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many people can perform, such as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - re-thinking and re-writing the website (which involves a lot of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sub-tasks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including the above)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - inviting more projects into the fold
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - working on the particulars of inter-project coordination (which  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sub-tasks)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - outreach and promotion to small communities (to adopt *any* of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the group's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> softwares)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - continuing the great philosophy, discussion, and brainstorming  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been conducted on this list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is just a first blush suggestion. Please reply and discuss  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think of this idea. In accordance with the history of this project,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need broad consent and consensus to go forward with this change. I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little short on time right now, so haven't put any of this on the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wiki, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the moment it would make sense to just discuss it here and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> summarize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there as the conversation develops.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!
