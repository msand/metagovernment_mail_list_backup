<PRE>Thanks Ed,

I haven't had any success with the repository, so I've only seen what is in
the prototype.

My next step is to diagram the user flow in open office so that we can
visualize the process much easier.

</I>&gt;<i> From the prototype it seems like a discussion board with a hand full of
</I>&gt;<i> tabs that don't quite make sense, although I get the feeling that the
</I>&gt;<i> discussions should somehow result in a final document. To this end, I went
</I>&gt;<i> about imagining how a discussion could somehow be captured in a document.
</I>&gt;<i> I've sketched a few of the ideas out on paper, but I wanted to share my
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts before scanning it in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To begin with: A Document is merely a collection of Articles. No matter how
</I>&gt;<i> complicated things might get, remember that a Document is merely a
</I>&gt;<i> collection of Articles. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Articles are divided into Sections. An Article may contain innumerable
</I>&gt;<i> Sections. Each Section is defined by its Paragraphs, of which it may contain
</I>&gt;<i> many. (Ie. Article 1, Section 2, Paragraph 2 of the United States
</I>&gt;<i> Contsitution states...) Each of these: the Article, the Section, and the
</I>&gt;<i> Paragraph, are part of the Header. As such, they may be voted or commented
</I>&gt;<i> upon, or recommended anew by those with the appropriate permissions
</I>&gt;<i> (described below). New Articles, Sections, Paragraphs, and Comments may also
</I>&gt;<i> contain Tags and References (described below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Underneath the Header is the Footer, which contains the Document's
</I>&gt;<i> metadata. This metadata includes the Authors of the Document, and its
</I>&gt;<i> permissions, along with a list of Tags and References. Tags are simply words
</I>&gt;<i> or phrases, separated by a comma, that describe the document. Tags are
</I>&gt;<i> displayed in a Tag Cloud, with the most frequent tags appearing larger than
</I>&gt;<i> those with single instances. References are links to websites which somehow
</I>&gt;<i> relate to the Document. The permissions and terms of use may only be set by
</I>&gt;<i> the creator, who may invite others to contribute, or open the document for
</I>&gt;<i> community involvement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On top of the document is a series of Tabs which select its point of view.
</I>&gt;<i> The first tab is the View Tab which displays a view of the Document. The
</I>&gt;<i> second tab, the Discuss Tab, displays the Discussions on the Document,
</I>&gt;<i> sorted chronologically, with a link to their originating Section, Article,
</I>&gt;<i> or Paragraph. The third tab, the Priority Tab, displays a list of proposed
</I>&gt;<i> modifications to the Document, sorted by recent activity, with a link to its
</I>&gt;<i> origin as well. The fourth tab is the Code Tab and contains a link to the
</I>&gt;<i> Source Code of the Document. The fifth and final tab is the History Tab, and
</I>&gt;<i> displays a chronological list of all the changes to and clones of the
</I>&gt;<i> document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To the right of the Document are it's tools that change according to which
</I>&gt;<i> tab is selected. The View Tab displays an optional image at the top of the
</I>&gt;<i> tools, above the Document's table of contents. The tools for the Discuss Tab
</I>&gt;<i> contain details about the conversations currently taking place, with a
</I>&gt;<i> button that invites the user to Start a Discussion. The Priority Tab
</I>&gt;<i> displays a set of tools that enable the user to create new Priorities. The
</I>&gt;<i> Code Tab shows helpful information on how to copy and edit the Document,
</I>&gt;<i> while the History Tab includes detailed information about the activities
</I>&gt;<i> related to the Document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And on top of it all rests the Document Bar -- a thin little strip that
</I>&gt;<i> begins with the Application Title: Metascore. To the right of MetaScore is
</I>&gt;<i> the Document Name. On the far right of the Bar is the User Name, a Settings
</I>&gt;<i> link, and a final link to Log Off. The Application Title, MetaScore, leads
</I>&gt;<i> to a list of all the Documents currently open on MetaScore. The tools to the
</I>&gt;<i> right display a log in prompt, or a button to create a New Document (should
</I>&gt;<i> the user be logged in). Clicking on the Document Name resets the Document to
</I>&gt;<i> its initial state. The User Name leads to a Recent List of Activity by the
</I>&gt;<i> User, while the Settings link to their private Settings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll leave the final Log Off link to the imagination.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know if I'm anywhere close and I can revise the process accordingly.
