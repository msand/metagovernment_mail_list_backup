<PRE>Owen, sorry if I don't answer you. You seem to speak in a very
burocratic way, and I have a hard time understanding it.

COuld you please explain me, for example, what is a stakeholder. How
is that different from a citizen, or a human being, or just a person.

Not trying to be obnoxious, just trying to lay the foundation of a
common vocabulary.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> [mailto:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start-bounces at metagovernment.org</A>] On Behalf Of Ed Pastore
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Wednesday, June 10, 2009 1:57 PM
</I>&gt;<i> To: Metagovernment Startup Committee
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Start] PROPOSAL: Reforming as a true meta-group
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While many people in this project share a common vision for Metascore,
</I>&gt;<i> this project might better serve the end goal of open governance by
</I>&gt;<i> being a true meta-organization. That is: instead of being one of the
</I>&gt;<i> many online governance projects, this group is already well on its way
</I>&gt;<i> to being the coordinating group for all of those projects, as is
</I>&gt;<i> emerging in:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I would like to propose that the original software development
</I>&gt;<i> group continue as the Metascore project, and the larger group of
</I>&gt;<i> groups be called the Metagovernment project. This &quot;new&quot; group would
</I>&gt;<i> not be as much of a formal organization as a &quot;tribe&quot; or coordination
</I>&gt;<i> group, where all the great ideas of the various projects can be
</I>&gt;<i> bounced off each other and promoted together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not meant to in any way diminish the great work we've done on
</I>&gt;<i> Metascore. I still think that its focus on a distributed model and a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus-through-synthesis mechanism probably is the way to go. But
</I>&gt;<i> there is no reason why this open, global group can't embrace all the
</I>&gt;<i> other projects as well, and let Metascore benefit from that
</I>&gt;<i> coordination effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be a coordination group, we would have to revisit the Basic
</I>&gt;<i> Principles. I would suggest that we make the first two principles the
</I>&gt;<i> Basic Principles, while the next two would remain with the Metascore
</I>&gt;<i> project but become Suggested Principles for the Metagovernment project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Mission statement would remain similar... perhaps something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to promote the
</I>&gt;<i> development and use of software which can act as the primary
</I>&gt;<i> governance mechanism of any community.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> And I think the Vision statement would not change very much at all.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would also have to do some re-writing of the website to make it
</I>&gt;<i> more inclusive of the diversity of projects we'd like to encompass
</I>&gt;<i> (using NationBuilder, Vilfredo, Votorola, DemocracyLab, and
</I>&gt;<i> Telemetrics Freedom as the basis for defining the expanded group). I
</I>&gt;<i> would also suggest that we revisit the word &quot;open source governance&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and try for something a little broader... perhaps just &quot;open
</I>&gt;<i> governance&quot; or &quot;online governance.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While there would be a lot of work involved... it would be work that
</I>&gt;<i> we *all* could do. The current project is hampered by reliance on
</I>&gt;<i> overtaxed developers to come up with software which can take us to the
</I>&gt;<i> next level. Meanwhile, there are a lot of other people who want to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to the project but don't have the means/ability/time to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to the code. If we re-form as the coordinating group, there
</I>&gt;<i> are suddenly lots of tasks that many people can perform, such as:
</I>&gt;<i> - re-thinking and re-writing the website (which involves a lot of sub-
</I>&gt;<i> tasks, including the above)
</I>&gt;<i> - inviting more projects into the fold
</I>&gt;<i> - working on the particulars of inter-project coordination (which has
</I>&gt;<i> many sub-tasks)
</I>&gt;<i> - outreach and promotion to small communities (to adopt *any* of the
</I>&gt;<i> group's softwares)
</I>&gt;<i> - continuing the great philosophy, discussion, and brainstorming that
</I>&gt;<i> has been conducted on this list
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is just a first blush suggestion. Please reply and discuss what
</I>&gt;<i> you think of this idea. In accordance with the history of this
</I>&gt;<i> project, we would need broad consent and consensus to go forward with
</I>&gt;<i> this change. I am a little short on time right now, so haven't put any
</I>&gt;<i> of this on the wiki, but for the moment it would make sense to just
</I>&gt;<i> discuss it here and summarize there as the conversation develops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
