<PRE>Dear All,
just to let you know that after incredible effort, and huge personal
risks, I finally managed to add an automatic email update to Vilfredo.
Now you can insert your email address:
here
<A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/editdetails.php">http://pareto.ironfire.org/editdetails.php</A>

ANd then on each question where you would like to be updated, you can
click the automatic update on, and you will receive an email every
time the question moves on from the writing phase to the evaluation
phase, and from the evaluation phase to the writing phase.

It is also possible to edit and change your email.

Also please consider that this will work for all the questions that
are not yours.
Gor the questions started by you, since you are the one who should
move on the question (btw, Thomas, Fabian :) ), the program as it is
set up now will not send you any reminder. You need to do that
yourself.

I think there should be a different system for the authors, but this
requires some thinking to avoid making it become really annoying.

In any case I am very happy, because the lack of a reminder was a
serious problem, as some people missed some proposing or some
endorsing procedures. And it is sometimes quite easy to fall out of
the game, if you feel the game went on without you. This sorts out
this.


Best Regards,
Pietro

P.S. I will not update you on all the little changes on this.  But I
do expect to roll out one after the other in the next days, as I make
the email more precise, including a link to what has movedon, and so
on.


</PRE>
