<PRE>Thanks for the heads-up, Jose.

I'm copying the Metagovernment listserv in the event that any of its
subscribers may wish to participate.

As I'm sure you know, this effort looks very much like what has been taking
place with respect to open government in the U.S.  From my perspective, it
would be good if the goals being proposed could be rendered in readily
shareable format on the Web, so that those with common objectives could more
easily identify each other and work more effectively together.

If an actual strategic plan is derived from this effort, I will be happy to
render it in StratML format, for inclusion in our collection at

Subject: co-creating an open declaration on public services 2.0 in EU

All, I think this one could be of interest to EU members and  
subscribers.

A group of volunteers (including me) are launching today an initiative  
to improve public services (2.0) in EU. Thanks go to David Osimo for  
getting this started.

The main question we are trying to answer is: &quot;What are the top things  
EU governments should do in the next 3 years to use the Web to  
transform public services?&quot;

This blog post can serve as an introduction:

ps: on a related note, I hope we could organize an eGov IG  
stakeholders meeting in EU in Q3/Q4 2009
