<PRE>I just want to say that I read the proposal, and I fully support it.
It seems to me that we were already going in this direction.

Also although not an officially recognised leader Ed is obviously the
person who have more leadership over how this group is progressing,
and he is not a programmer. But he is really good in connecting with
people. This will free his hands into doing more and better what he is
already doing very well.

I also saw the video about tribes that was presented at TED some days
ago, and how to change the world via a tribe. I support it, although
it seems to me that it has a disturbing perversion where the person
who starts and initiate the tribe seems at the end to take the full
acknowledgment of all the work. Most of the work which was done by
others. For example, how many of you know that the Nobel that was
given to Al Gore was not in fact given just to Al Gore, but to him and
to the &quot;UN's climate panel&quot; (which I understand also includes the
people who made the movie an inconvenient truth). But who remembers
that? Even from wikipedia is not easy to find out who those people are
(i.e. the names).

So, in short, I think it is quite possible that Ed will end up at TED,
and my fear is that as I have a great desire to go to TED, as many of
us, if this becomes a tribe we see our representative go there, and we
be excluded. This bothers me a bit. After all this whole work is
coming out out of our desire to be involved in the decisions that
concerns us, and not to delegate them.

Other than for this concern, I fully support this proposal.

Cheers,
Pietro

&gt;<i> While many people in this project share a common vision for Metascore, this
</I>&gt;<i> project might better serve the end goal of open governance by being a true
</I>&gt;<i> meta-organization. That is: instead of being one of the many online
</I>&gt;<i> governance projects, this group is already well on its way to being the
</I>&gt;<i> coordinating group for all of those projects, as is emerging in:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I would like to propose that the original software development group
</I>&gt;<i> continue as the Metascore project, and the larger group of groups be called
</I>&gt;<i> the Metagovernment project. This &quot;new&quot; group would not be as much of a
</I>&gt;<i> formal organization as a &quot;tribe&quot; or coordination group, where all the great
</I>&gt;<i> ideas of the various projects can be bounced off each other and promoted
</I>&gt;<i> together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not meant to in any way diminish the great work we've done on
</I>&gt;<i> Metascore. I still think that its focus on a distributed model and a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus-through-synthesis mechanism probably is the way to go. But there
</I>&gt;<i> is no reason why this open, global group can't embrace all the other
</I>&gt;<i> projects as well, and let Metascore benefit from that coordination effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be a coordination group, we would have to revisit the Basic Principles. I
</I>&gt;<i> would suggest that we make the first two principles the Basic Principles,
</I>&gt;<i> while the next two would remain with the Metascore project but become
</I>&gt;<i> Suggested Principles for the Metagovernment project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Mission statement would remain similar... perhaps something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to promote the development and
</I>&gt;<i> use of software which can act as the primary governance mechanism of any
</I>&gt;<i> community.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> And I think the Vision statement would not change very much at all.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would also have to do some re-writing of the website to make it more
</I>&gt;<i> inclusive of the diversity of projects we'd like to encompass (using
</I>&gt;<i> NationBuilder, Vilfredo, Votorola, DemocracyLab, and Telemetrics Freedom as
</I>&gt;<i> the basis for defining the expanded group). I would also suggest that we
</I>&gt;<i> revisit the word &quot;open source governance&quot; and try for something a little
</I>&gt;<i> broader... perhaps just &quot;open governance&quot; or &quot;online governance.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While there would be a lot of work involved... it would be work that we
</I>&gt;<i> *all* could do. The current project is hampered by reliance on overtaxed
</I>&gt;<i> developers to come up with software which can take us to the next level.
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile, there are a lot of other people who want to contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> project but don't have the means/ability/time to contribute to the code. If
</I>&gt;<i> we re-form as the coordinating group, there are suddenly lots of tasks that
</I>&gt;<i> many people can perform, such as:
</I>&gt;<i> - re-thinking and re-writing the website (which involves a lot of sub-tasks,
</I>&gt;<i> including the above)
</I>&gt;<i> - inviting more projects into the fold
</I>&gt;<i> - working on the particulars of inter-project coordination (which has many
</I>&gt;<i> sub-tasks)
</I>&gt;<i> - outreach and promotion to small communities (to adopt *any* of the group's
</I>&gt;<i> softwares)
</I>&gt;<i> - continuing the great philosophy, discussion, and brainstorming that has
</I>&gt;<i> been conducted on this list
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is just a first blush suggestion. Please reply and discuss what you
</I>&gt;<i> think of this idea. In accordance with the history of this project, we would
</I>&gt;<i> need broad consent and consensus to go forward with this change. I am a
</I>&gt;<i> little short on time right now, so haven't put any of this on the wiki, but
</I>&gt;<i> for the moment it would make sense to just discuss it here and summarize
</I>&gt;<i> there as the conversation develops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
