Thanks for your feedback, Ed!

I'd like to start thinking about the User Experience in terms of use cases,
just to get a better idea of who we're trying to communicate with and what
we're aiming to communicate. Here are a couple ideas that I have had over
the the last few months. What comes to mind when you imagine a MetaScore
user?

1. Two Internet geeks who have decided to forego the passe marriage on the
World of Warcraft, and opt instead to take an Open Vow. Each of the
soon-to-be newly weds log into MetaScore and create an account. One of them
creates a document entitled: An Open Marriage Vow, and invites the other to
be an editor. The two of them work night and day, entering vows, making
recommendations, and perfecting their immortal promises to each other. Then,
when the moment has finally arrived, they both make their Open Vows to one
another, committing not only to each other, but to every revision they agree
upon, until death does its part.

2. A ranking member of their local neighborhood community who has decided to
upload their laws and regulations to MetaScore. Afterwords, the local
community organizer visits door to door to ensure that everyone knows about
the Open Community Benefits and Regulations. The pamphlet leads to the
MetaScore document created by the community organization, and contains an
invitation to join the community. Every member of the community has the
ability to discuss each benefit and regulation, and rank their approval or
disatisfaction. Others may draft their own laws which are voted on by the
community exactly like all the other rules on the book.

3. An Iranian who decides to extend the Twitter revolution to MetaScore, and
begins constructing a truly Democratic Constitution, based on the model set
forth by their current Government. Everyone who wears a green bandana on
their Profiles are invited to join MetaScore, and edit the Open Constitution
of Iran (or whatever its full title should be). He sends out a Tweet with
the popular tags, and instantly twenty people are retweeting the post.
Slowly, more people find their way through Twitter to MetaScore, where they
evaluate the Articles of their Constitution, and continue to refine their
laws through discussions and votes. In turn, each Member pledges themselves
to the Open Constitution on which their New Government shall stand.

4. A group of software develepers and social theorists who decide to build a
system of governance with open source technology. The initial leader begins
THE MetaScore Document on MetaScore. This is the Document to Define all
Documents on MetaScore. Each member creates their own section of the
document to define the art and architecture of the system. Each of these
contributions appear on the front of their MetaScore page so that members
could easily track, discuss, and vote on each new change to the document.
The ultimate changes would be available for anyone to see, along with an
invitation to join the development of THE MetaScore Document of ALL
Documents. (End ominous music.)

5. The grand-daughter of an old man who is mentally failing in his final
years. She creates an Open Care Plan for her grand-father, and invites the
members of his immediate family, including his two daughters, and son, along
with two other members of their extended family that grand-father trusts.
Likewise, she invites certain members of her grand-father's care community,
such as his primary physician, the altheimers councilor, and so forth. Each
of them draft their own sections of the Open Care Plan, including his
physical, mental, and emotional needs. Everyone has the ability to recommend
their own sections, and everyone can vote on their overall importance, in
order to create a dynamic Care Plan that addresses her grand-father's most
immediate needs.

6. A local voter decides to get direclty involved with the American Stimulus
Package, and signs onto MetaScore to create an Open Request for Mono-Rails
between the major city and his home town. He creates a Page on Facebook and
adds the MetaScore application, which broadcasts his Request to each of his
friends. In turn, they discuss the link, and ultimately arrive at the
Facebook application which contains individual sections of his Open Request.
Those friends who sign into the MetaScore application have the ability to
rank sections of the proposal, or include new sections of their own. The
results are posted to their Facebook Page and shared with members of their
local government.

There are a few more user stories I have been considering, but I think that
is a good place to start a conversation! :D
