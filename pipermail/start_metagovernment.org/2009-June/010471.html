That's the idea behind the re-organization proposal: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization/Proposal_2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization/Proposal_2</A>
which I would like to remind everyone to give input into by June 30:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization#Proposal_2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization#Proposal_2</A>

There is also the corollary Standardization process, which is in its  
infancy:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization</A>

&gt;<i> Essentially, there are too many paths for a user to take towards an  
</I>&gt;<i> open government, and I'm having a hard time envisioning this so that  
</I>&gt;<i> I can contribute something of value from my own bag o' skills.

I think it will be wonderful for the real-world marketplace to play  
with all of these various formations and see what develops. But if  
you're looking for a place to contribute, the Metascore project is  
dying for your help and is the only of these many projects that is  
very actively seeking just the sort of help you could provide. Its  
user experience is its greatest weakness at this time.
