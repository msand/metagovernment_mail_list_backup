<PRE>My predisposition prompts me to view this issue in terms of our goals and
objectives that may be similar, if not identical to those being pursued by
others.  

To the degree that we are aiming to do the same things for the same
stakeholders, it seems to me that we owe it to our prospective stakeholders
to try to accomplish our objectives in ways that do not impose needless
burdens upon them (not only for their sake but also for our own ... to avoid
wasting our time working toward virtually certain failure).  

In order to avoid causing that effect, it is important first to be pretty
clear about what it is that we are aiming to do and for whom we aim to do
it.  Unless and until both our objectives and our stakeholders are
sufficiently well specified, it is hard to know exactly with whom we should
be collaborating much less whether we are serving needs that anyone really
cares about.

Having said that, the general direction that Ed suggests seems reasonable to
me, and I look forward to seeing what we can make of it.

[mailto:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start-bounces at metagovernment.org</A>] On Behalf Of Ed Pastore

Subject: [Start] PROPOSAL: Reforming as a true meta-group

While many people in this project share a common vision for Metascore,  
this project might better serve the end goal of open governance by  
being a true meta-organization. That is: instead of being one of the  
many online governance projects, this group is already well on its way  
to being the coordinating group for all of those projects, as is  
emerging in:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization</A>

So I would like to propose that the original software development  
group continue as the Metascore project, and the larger group of  
groups be called the Metagovernment project. This &quot;new&quot; group would  
not be as much of a formal organization as a &quot;tribe&quot; or coordination  
group, where all the great ideas of the various projects can be  
bounced off each other and promoted together.

This is not meant to in any way diminish the great work we've done on  
Metascore. I still think that its focus on a distributed model and a  
consensus-through-synthesis mechanism probably is the way to go. But  
there is no reason why this open, global group can't embrace all the  
other projects as well, and let Metascore benefit from that  
coordination effort.

To be a coordination group, we would have to revisit the Basic  
Principles. I would suggest that we make the first two principles the  
Basic Principles, while the next two would remain with the Metascore  
project but become Suggested Principles for the Metagovernment project.

The Mission statement would remain similar... perhaps something like:
&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to promote the  
development and use of software which can act as the primary  
governance mechanism of any community.&quot;
And I think the Vision statement would not change very much at all.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>

We would also have to do some re-writing of the website to make it  
more inclusive of the diversity of projects we'd like to encompass  
(using NationBuilder, Vilfredo, Votorola, DemocracyLab, and  
Telemetrics Freedom as the basis for defining the expanded group). I  
would also suggest that we revisit the word &quot;open source governance&quot;  
and try for something a little broader... perhaps just &quot;open  
governance&quot; or &quot;online governance.&quot;

While there would be a lot of work involved... it would be work that  
we *all* could do. The current project is hampered by reliance on  
overtaxed developers to come up with software which can take us to the  
next level. Meanwhile, there are a lot of other people who want to  
contribute to the project but don't have the means/ability/time to  
contribute to the code. If we re-form as the coordinating group, there  
are suddenly lots of tasks that many people can perform, such as:
- re-thinking and re-writing the website (which involves a lot of sub- 
tasks, including the above)
- inviting more projects into the fold
- working on the particulars of inter-project coordination (which has  
many sub-tasks)
- outreach and promotion to small communities (to adopt *any* of the  
group's softwares)
- continuing the great philosophy, discussion, and brainstorming that  
has been conducted on this list

This is just a first blush suggestion. Please reply and discuss what  
you think of this idea. In accordance with the history of this  
project, we would need broad consent and consensus to go forward with  
this change. I am a little short on time right now, so haven't put any  
of this on the wiki, but for the moment it would make sense to just  
discuss it here and summarize there as the conversation develops.

Thanks!
