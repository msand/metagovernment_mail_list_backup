I guess they're developing tools for public decision making, like all
of the technical projects.  They don't do day-to-day executive
decisions (like Metascore) or primary elections (like Votorola) but
they do do plans, policies and laws (like all).  Where this fits with
governance though... everyone has their own theories.

&gt;<i> As for the momentum of the Metagovernment collaborative project, that's in 
</I>&gt;<i> part up to you. Michael, you've been really helpful in the idea and it 
</I>&gt;<i> would be great if you would be involved in the development of the

</I>
I'm keen to help with the open architecture, and other things too.
Thomas is away till next week (not sure he has Internet access) but
last time we spoke he was looking forward to contributing too.  So
Votorola's on side.

MixedInk is running a business model that depends on a closed
architecture.  Other projects are too.  I don't mean to demonize them
but I *do* want to see them eating dust.  Maybe others don't see the
fun in that... maybe it's just technical competitiveness.

PS - Looking forward to your presentation:

&gt;<i> Note, I will be presenting about direct democracy tomorrow at 11:30AM  
</I>&gt;<i> EST (1530 GMT) at Participation Camp, and you can &quot;attend&quot; by watching  
</I>&gt;<i> the live stream. Other sessions are streaming right now:
