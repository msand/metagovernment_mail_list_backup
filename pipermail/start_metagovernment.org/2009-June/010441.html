<PRE>Mat&#237;as, Cool summary! Rephrasing Archimedes, &quot;Give me coffee, time and a
bunch of smart people and we will change the world&quot;.
Just to put everybody on sync, Argentina has a public education system that
allows people to study a major by paying virtually nothing but the books.
This sounds great in words, and kind of commie :) , but you need to know
that Argentinian governments have traditionally had a socialist tendency
(it's much deeper than that, but I won't bore you with history). This worked
amazingly well for lots of years, but we've seen an important degradation of
the public education system in the last 15 years or so.

The point is, these public universities have very strong political
organizations that are called &quot;student centers&quot;. Each faculty within a
public university has it's own center. They handle a lot of the affairs of
the faculty. They even have a budget. And share the same issues as a real
government. Corruption, wars for power, lies, lack of transparency... Most
of the soon-to-be politicians in Argentina are now activists in
the universities' political branches.

We expect university students will understand our concepts and mission, and
share them. We know that we can't take the establishment by assault. So
probably the best way is to go from inside. So our ideas are:


   1. Get people interested. Get CS students to participate in actively
   developing metascore or whatever software they feel most identified with.
   Get people to participate in metagovernment and the general concepts of an
   open governance system.
   2. Create a political party that can be elected to govern a student
   center. With the objective of gradually implementing open governance. Once
   this is implemented in one student center and (cross your fingers) works
   well, we expect it will just explode. Whatever happens in Argentinian's
   public universities have an incredible visibility nation-wide.

Of course this is over simplified, but we need to take the first step.

Your comments and suggestions are very welcome.

Thanks,

Juan

&gt;<i> Today Juan &#193;lvarez, his girlfriend Sof&#237;a and I met for a chat and a coffee,
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere in Buenos Aires. It was a productive encounter, since we defined a
</I>&gt;<i> plan to promote Open Source Governance (OSG). The lack of non-experimental
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative decision-maker website makes us to aim specifically at big
</I>&gt;<i> Universities, rather than the general society. More contributors are needed,
</I>&gt;<i> and we assume better probabilities of finding them in the higher education
</I>&gt;<i> ambient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> THE STRATEGY
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To place physical banners at the important Universities across the country,
</I>&gt;<i> that redirect to the project's page. They are made in Buenos Aires and sent
</I>&gt;<i> in packages to familiars, friends and contacts of other cities. We desire a
</I>&gt;<i> wide coverage, and shall use a network to achieve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> THE AD
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's an optical disk (CD or DVD) with a stencil graffiti over the
</I>&gt;<i> write/read-able surface. Its geometrical form distincts it from the cumulus
</I>&gt;<i> of other political ads, that always are rectangular. The rainbow shinning
</I>&gt;<i> calls for attention. It promotes www.metagobierno.org with a succinct
</I>&gt;<i> slogan. (Please, help us to find one:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=38.">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=38.</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the non-write/read-able side goes an adhesive layer protected by a
</I>&gt;<i> removable film. This is to facilitate the task of placing the banners in
</I>&gt;<i> walls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To get disks cheaply we want to implement a recycling program: to give away
</I>&gt;<i> a new disk in change of three used ones, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are going to produce the banners with money from us... Argentinean peso
</I>&gt;<i> is devaluated, one dolar equals four pesos and one euro, five. So, small
</I>&gt;<i> (but really useful) aids coming form the members of this list will be
</I>&gt;<i> happily accepted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> THE PAGE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's the Spanish Metagovernment version of the wiki, plus a university
</I>&gt;<i> activism section. There visitors are encouraged to participate in the
</I>&gt;<i> meta-project and/or projects, promote the political philosophy and support
</I>&gt;<i> the movement. And when OSG tools are ready, to form open University
</I>&gt;<i> political parties and gain control over Student Centres and Directive
</I>&gt;<i> Commissions (dummy executives that follows stakeholders' decisions). If this
</I>&gt;<i> happen in at least one Faculty of one University, the spread of this form of
</I>&gt;<i> government over most of the higher educational institutions of the country
</I>&gt;<i> (and some publicity as well) is straight forward. Then the society may know
</I>&gt;<i> a possible political zenith.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> THE NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We think to fund one (within a year?) and relate it to an account to
</I>&gt;<i> receive money from national and foreign supporters. SMS donation seems
</I>&gt;<i> attractive, and of course, all others paid methods such as PayPal will be
</I>&gt;<i> adopted. Argentina has good and achievable human resources and
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure for IT, programmers will be hired to boost the developing of
</I>&gt;<i> OSG software, and maybe we can have our own free hosting service for OSG
</I>&gt;<i> projects. Also assistance &#8212;in the broader sense&#8212; to open organizations (such
</I>&gt;<i> as open Student Centers) will be given.
