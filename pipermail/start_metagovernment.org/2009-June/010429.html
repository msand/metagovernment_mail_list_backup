I believe this is the *only* way of doing it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> coming out out of our desire to be involved in the decisions that

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> While many people in this project share a common vision for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Metascore, this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> project might better serve the end goal of open governance by being
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a true
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> meta-organization. That is: instead of being one of the many online
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> governance projects, this group is already well on its way to being the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> coordinating group for all of those projects, as is emerging in:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So I would like to propose that the original software development group
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> continue as the Metascore project, and the larger group of groups be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> called
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the Metagovernment project. This &quot;new&quot; group would not be as much of a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> formal organization as a &quot;tribe&quot; or coordination group, where all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the great
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ideas of the various projects can be bounced off each other and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> promoted
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> together.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is not meant to in any way diminish the great work we've done on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Metascore. I still think that its focus on a distributed model and a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consensus-through-synthesis mechanism probably is the way to go. But
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is no reason why this open, global group can't embrace all the other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> projects as well, and let Metascore benefit from that coordination
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> To be a coordination group, we would have to revisit the Basic
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Principles. I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would suggest that we make the first two principles the Basic
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Principles,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> while the next two would remain with the Metascore project but become
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Suggested Principles for the Metagovernment project.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The Mission statement would remain similar... perhaps something like:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to promote the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> development and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use of software which can act as the primary governance mechanism of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> community.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And I think the Vision statement would not change very much at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We would also have to do some re-writing of the website to make it more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inclusive of the diversity of projects we'd like to encompass (using
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> NationBuilder, Vilfredo, Votorola, DemocracyLab, and Telemetrics
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Freedom as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the basis for defining the expanded group). I would also suggest
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> revisit the word &quot;open source governance&quot; and try for something a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> little
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> broader... perhaps just &quot;open governance&quot; or &quot;online governance.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> While there would be a lot of work involved... it would be work that we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *all* could do. The current project is hampered by reliance on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> overtaxed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> developers to come up with software which can take us to the next
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> level.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Meanwhile, there are a lot of other people who want to contribute to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> project but don't have the means/ability/time to contribute to the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> code. If
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we re-form as the coordinating group, there are suddenly lots of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tasks that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> many people can perform, such as:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - re-thinking and re-writing the website (which involves a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sub-tasks,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> including the above)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - inviting more projects into the fold
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - working on the particulars of inter-project coordination (which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> has many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sub-tasks)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - outreach and promotion to small communities (to adopt *any* of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> group's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> softwares)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - continuing the great philosophy, discussion, and brainstorming
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that has
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> been conducted on this list
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is just a first blush suggestion. Please reply and discuss what
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> think of this idea. In accordance with the history of this project,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> need broad consent and consensus to go forward with this change. I am a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> little short on time right now, so haven't put any of this on the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wiki, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for the moment it would make sense to just discuss it here and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> summarize
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there as the conversation develops.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!
