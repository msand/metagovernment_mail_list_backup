<PRE>Hi all,

Finally, something I can respond too!&#160; I have been reading the messages for a while on this list, and find the topic very interesting.&#160; However, I am not up to par with the techical aspect of things, so I haven't contributed.&#160; Also, my school year is winding down and demands all of my energy.&#160; To add to the pile, I just had my dissertation approved, and have finally earned my Ph.D.&#160; Not that any of this is material...

In addition to teaching high school science, I am&#160;my school's Student Government Advisor.&#160; We have approximately 1,000 students, and I advise class officers from all 4&#160;secondary grade levels.&#160; Could the Metagovernment group think of a way I can implement the principles you have discussed with my student population?&#160; I'm open to suggestions.
&#160;
Ron Skolnick

Subject: Re: [Start] Perspectives of activism in Argentina

This is great, guys, and I agree with everything Jacki said... I also have been thinking that Parent-Teacher Organizations seem like a proper-sized community for an early start (though extremely organizations, such as non-profit startups, may be even better for the very first stages).

Most of this plan sounds like it can work, with various permutations (most notably language!) outside of Argentina. When I have time (or if you do), this should be put on the wiki so others can flesh it out even more... though it is pretty solid already.

Note that previously I had posted some very simplistic campaign literature here:

(Unfortunately, allowing user uploads on the wiki is somewhat complex, so for now, I am posting files manually by FTP... but I'll gladly post whatever anyone produces.)

</I>&gt;<i> In observing the other projects with and without representation on the list, it seems that *local* implementations may be more successful in conveying our broad concepts their utility, since the exercise in global or national spheres often feels theoretical. At this point, there is little perceptible impact.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have often considered a similar approach here in the US, only through the community parent-teacher organizations that participate in governing the local school systems. These groups do not often mature to be politicians, but the debates are heated and the stakes high. But, this population does not have IT resources on hand, nor any interest in development so the software has to come first.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All this is to say, how very excited I am to hear your plans. I hope they serve as a model for similar initiatives.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please post to the list with ideas/updates as I for one am interested to know how it goes.
