<PRE>Seeing as most recent traffic on this list has been about the  
standardization effort and not the Metagovernment project proper (not  
that I have any objection toward a unified standard), I wanted to  
update the list on this particular project's status.

The Metascore team is working on a rather large update to their code,  
but are tied up in other things at the moment. So you can expect to  
hear more from them in the following month or two.

There is still plenty else that can be done, particularly in fleshing  
out the wiki and in promoting this project. Please look here for what  
you can do right now:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate</A>

Also, the Vilfredo/FP7 team is expecting results from FP7 in July  
(right?); and whatever the result they will be able to share a lot  
more information at that time. Hopefully this project will benefit  
from that labor as well.

Currently this list has 79 members (several subscribers dropped off  
recently for some reason). If you have joined this list and have not  
yet posted to it, please post a brief introduction of yourself and  
your interest in the project. Any input is welcome. For some samples,  
look at some of the first posts to this list:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-April/date.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-April/date.html</A>

The wiki now has 114 registered users
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Special:Statistics">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Special:Statistics</A>
and the Main Page is approaching 29,000 hits.

Anyone else who has project status updates to present, please reply to  
this message.
