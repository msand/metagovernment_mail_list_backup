<PRE>I think the programmers would agree with you as to the current level  
of sophistication of the interface. As I understand it, they have put  
almost all of their effort into back-end development, with just a nod  
to interface when necessary.

Just to be sure you all are on the same page, have you looked at  
Fabe's latest code? He has been working on it as recently as yesterday
<A HREF="http://bitbucket.org/fabe/metascore/overview/">http://bitbucket.org/fabe/metascore/overview/</A>
and I don't think anything from the past couple of months is reflected  
in the running prototype. (Fabe, do you have an ETA on when you might  
be able to post a new prototype?)

I love what you are suggesting below. I can't make intelligent  
comments without actually seeing it, but from what I can envision it  
sounds very promising.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the prototype it seems like a discussion board with a hand full  
</I>&gt;<i> of tabs that don't quite make sense, although I get the feeling that  
</I>&gt;<i> the discussions should somehow result in a final document. To this  
</I>&gt;<i> end, I went about imagining how a discussion could somehow be  
</I>&gt;<i> captured in a document. I've sketched a few of the ideas out on  
</I>&gt;<i> paper, but I wanted to share my thoughts before scanning it in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To begin with: A Document is merely a collection of Articles. No  
</I>&gt;<i> matter how complicated things might get, remember that a Document is  
</I>&gt;<i> merely a collection of Articles. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Articles are divided into Sections. An Article may contain  
</I>&gt;<i> innumerable Sections. Each Section is defined by its Paragraphs, of  
</I>&gt;<i> which it may contain many. (Ie. Article 1, Section 2, Paragraph 2 of  
</I>&gt;<i> the United States Contsitution states...) Each of these: the  
</I>&gt;<i> Article, the Section, and the Paragraph, are part of the Header. As  
</I>&gt;<i> such, they may be voted or commented upon, or recommended anew by  
</I>&gt;<i> those with the appropriate permissions (described below). New  
</I>&gt;<i> Articles, Sections, Paragraphs, and Comments may also contain Tags  
</I>&gt;<i> and References (described below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Underneath the Header is the Footer, which contains the Document's  
</I>&gt;<i> metadata. This metadata includes the Authors of the Document, and  
</I>&gt;<i> its permissions, along with a list of Tags and References. Tags are  
</I>&gt;<i> simply words or phrases, separated by a comma, that describe the  
</I>&gt;<i> document. Tags are displayed in a Tag Cloud, with the most frequent  
</I>&gt;<i> tags appearing larger than those with single instances. References  
</I>&gt;<i> are links to websites which somehow relate to the Document. The  
</I>&gt;<i> permissions and terms of use may only be set by the creator, who may  
</I>&gt;<i> invite others to contribute, or open the document for community  
</I>&gt;<i> involvement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On top of the document is a series of Tabs which select its point of  
</I>&gt;<i> view. The first tab is the View Tab which displays a view of the  
</I>&gt;<i> Document. The second tab, the Discuss Tab, displays the Discussions  
</I>&gt;<i> on the Document, sorted chronologically, with a link to their  
</I>&gt;<i> originating Section, Article, or Paragraph. The third tab, the  
</I>&gt;<i> Priority Tab, displays a list of proposed modifications to the  
</I>&gt;<i> Document, sorted by recent activity, with a link to its origin as  
</I>&gt;<i> well. The fourth tab is the Code Tab and contains a link to the  
</I>&gt;<i> Source Code of the Document. The fifth and final tab is the History  
</I>&gt;<i> Tab, and displays a chronological list of all the changes to and  
</I>&gt;<i> clones of the document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To the right of the Document are it's tools that change according to  
</I>&gt;<i> which tab is selected. The View Tab displays an optional image at  
</I>&gt;<i> the top of the tools, above the Document's table of contents. The  
</I>&gt;<i> tools for the Discuss Tab contain details about the conversations  
</I>&gt;<i> currently taking place, with a button that invites the user to Start  
</I>&gt;<i> a Discussion. The Priority Tab displays a set of tools that enable  
</I>&gt;<i> the user to create new Priorities. The Code Tab shows helpful  
</I>&gt;<i> information on how to copy and edit the Document, while the History  
</I>&gt;<i> Tab includes detailed information about the activities related to  
</I>&gt;<i> the Document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And on top of it all rests the Document Bar -- a thin little strip  
</I>&gt;<i> that begins with the Application Title: Metascore. To the right of  
</I>&gt;<i> MetaScore is the Document Name. On the far right of the Bar is the  
</I>&gt;<i> User Name, a Settings link, and a final link to Log Off. The  
</I>&gt;<i> Application Title, MetaScore, leads to a list of all the Documents  
</I>&gt;<i> currently open on MetaScore. The tools to the right display a log in  
</I>&gt;<i> prompt, or a button to create a New Document (should the user be  
</I>&gt;<i> logged in). Clicking on the Document Name resets the Document to its  
</I>&gt;<i> initial state. The User Name leads to a Recent List of Activity by  
</I>&gt;<i> the User, while the Settings link to their private Settings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll leave the final Log Off link to the imagination.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know if I'm anywhere close and I can revise the process  
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly.
