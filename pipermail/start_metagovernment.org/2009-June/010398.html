<PRE>Hello all,

I received the following news/advert from MixedInk.  The &quot;Embeddable
Widget&quot; (see below) caught my eye.  I haven't actually tried it out
(my desktop box is in dry dock, for a couple of days) but it appears
to cover one of the use cases of an open network architecture, where
users can add Vote buttons, or whatever, to their own sites:

  <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization#Free_Range_Voting">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization#Free_Range_Voting</A>

Ofc, MixedInk is purely a commercial play, so I bet this is actually
sitting on a &quot;closed network architecture&quot; that is owned by MixedInk.

Greetings from MixedInk!

We're writing to let you know about a unique opportunity to help shape health
care policy.  We're also unveiling an exciting new feature and sharing some other
recent news about MixedInk.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Help Congress Draft Health Care Policy

Over the next couple of months, Congress will be designing legislation that will
 fundamentally reshape our health care system.  Representative Anthony Weiner, a
 member of the health subcommittee that will be writing the bill, is inviting citizens
to draft key health care principles together using MixedInk.

Check it out: <A HREF="http://mixedink.com/CongressmanAnthonyWeiner/Healthcare">http://mixedink.com/CongressmanAnthonyWeiner/Healthcare</A>

Here's a video of Congressman Weiner introducing the project: <A HREF="http://vimeo.com/4771922">http://vimeo.com/4771922</A>

Remember, at MixedInk, you can write your own set of health care principles, remix
what others write, and rate to help the best ideas rise to the top.  Since Representative
Weiner submitted the first version, you can add to what he wrote or borrow some 
of his words to make a new version.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Feature: Embeddable Widget

With MixedInk's new widget, now you can invite your community to collaborate directly
on your website!  It's as easy as adding a YouTube video to your site.  All you 
have to do to take the widget out for a test drive is:
1.  Start a new topic or visit an existing one at MixedInk.com
2.  Click the &quot;add to your site&quot; link from the left hand column of the topic's &quot;info&quot;
tab.
3.  Copy the embed code.
4.  Paste it onto your blog or webpage.

Got other feature ideas?  Send us an email at <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">feedback at mixedink.com.</A>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
