<PRE>Just one point I think is out of date:

conseo said:
&gt;<i> ...  Our problem so far has been the lack of real users, not the
</I>&gt;<i> lack of implementing your/our requirements.  ...
</I>
We used to think we were hampered by a lack of alpha users, but it
turned out we had enough to finish the job.  All we needed was the
idea of pipe positions (credit Thomas).  With that we're into beta.

We have enough beta users too.  All we lack are informal participants.
If the study I'm conducting is successful, however, then we'll have
enough of those.  Votorola is maybe unique in requiring so little of
its participants; most needn't use any new tools or practices at all,
they need only be prepared to talk to each other.  That's contribution
enough.  Votorola supports the discussion from a discrete distance,
often unseen by the participants.  It provides a supporting frame
around an apparently natural scene. *

The technology isn't beta quality yet; but it's a social technology
and therefore the full trials must be conducted in public, making them
beta trials by definition.  Still the informal participants are
shielded from most of the unfinished, sharp edges.


 * In some ways like this masterpiece of documentary theatre:
