<PRE>Ned, you don't answer my question.  I was hoping for an answer that
could be translated into a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.

&gt;<i> ... you will need to give me some guidance on how to make it more
</I>&gt;<i> clear.  What do you not understand about how deciders acquire
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of what the decision ought to be?
</I>
Whether or not they are successful in acquiring it.  My question was,
Do the deciders already know what the decisions ought to be?

Mike


Ned Conner said:
&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; ... I would say that we don't need a separate primary guidance
</I>&gt;<i>     system. To have such a system would be unnecessary, expensive,
</I>&gt;<i>     wasteful, and distracting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; The need is to inform the deciders of what the decision ought
</I>&gt;<i>     to be. Do the deciders already have this knowledge on your &quot;planet&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     as you put it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Each decider becomes informed concerning what the decision
</I>&gt;<i>     ought to be through whatever means the decider chooses. Each decider
</I>&gt;<i>     decides autonomously what the decision ought to be, and then presses
</I>&gt;<i>     for that decision through the discourse that determines the decision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; I can't tell whether your answer is yes, or no. I wasn't
</I>&gt;<i>     asking about who the deciders are, but only about their knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i>     Do they already know what the decisions ought to be?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If my paragraph above (that was included in my answer) is not clear 
</I>&gt;<i> enough, you will need to give me some guidance on how to make it more 
</I>&gt;<i> clear. What do you not understand about how deciders acquire knowledge 
</I>&gt;<i> of what the decision ought to be?
</I>
