<PRE>Hi Marc and Mike,

    Mike&gt; A discursive baseline is a minimal level of discussion that is
    sustained as a developmental reference. It is the &quot;lump of clay&quot;
    held by the discourse practitioner to which she gives shape, against
    which she judges the potential and progress of her work, and tests
    the need and efficacy of her tools. It is a discussion with the
    following properties: (a) long lived, so the clay stays in the hands
    of the practitioner; (b) focused on the issue of an action norm,
    because such norms strongly depend on discursive validation; and (c)
    public, because only those affected by the action can rightly
    validate it. These properties, plus any formal supports that are
    needed to sustain them, comprise the discursive baseline. 

I am having trouble understanding the desirability of discussions that 
go on and on.

The &quot;product&quot; of a decision system is decisions made. The product of a 
&quot;guidance system&quot; is decisions guided. One primary aim of such systems 
(I would have thought) is to facilitate coming to agreement, as quickly 
and efficiently as possible. The tools and practices succeed to the 
extent that they serve that aim (among others). Even a guidance system 
needs to answer to practical considerations such as quickness and 
efficiency.

There are plenty of action norms to be set. It is not as if actually 
succeeding in reaching agreement with respect to any particular norm is 
going to put us out of business.

Mike, do you think that quickness and efficiency don't matter?
