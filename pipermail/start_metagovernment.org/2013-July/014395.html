<PRE>Hi Stephen et al.,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there some issue/management system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in place for the coop which could be extended in this direction (e.g. as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; web-issue-tracker)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Co-op doesn't have any web forum/issue/management system that I am aware
</I>&gt;<i> of. The closest they come (to that) is a comment/suggestion/question box
</I>&gt;<i> inside the store next to a bulletin board where they post answers from
</I>&gt;<i> whomever the comments/questions/suggestions are directed towards. Having
</I>&gt;<i> something like this online where members could more easily read other
</I>&gt;<i> members contributions...and work together on proposed
</I>&gt;<i> *suggestions/solutions* could be a real benefit. I think it could be a
</I>&gt;<i> great tool for improving member interface with management.
</I>
Ok. Maybe they have something internal, at least this should be clarified, 
otherwise one might have a public forum for chatter+publicity and a hidden 
internal process with the &quot;real&quot; content. If they mostly communicate per mail, 
this should also be documented.

&gt;<i> &gt; I have some micromanagement/community-tool/wiki in mind,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably integrated in either social networks or mobile work-flows of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; workers, open to outside contributions, whatever makes sense. It's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult to judge from here. I know Scrum and agile concepts for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bottom-up software development and project management. Votorola is also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available. I could also have a look at similar coops here, probably after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exams, and look if one can cooperate on production technology over the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; web similar to Open Source Ecology, for example. (2)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That all sounds interesting. I'm working on an outline for what I have in
</I>&gt;<i> mind. I'll need a few more days to put it together. In the meantime, could
</I>&gt;<i> you (or somebody) suggest which *practice* would work for the type of
</I>&gt;<i> *collaborative proposal development* we've been discussing? I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> begin familiarizing myself with what is already *imagined* or available.
</I>
In agile software engineering story cards are often used: (1)

Story card 1:

Alice has an idea for her community. She enters a short description in the 
system. The system shows no similar issues. She creates a new proposal and the 
system creates a global issue id for it (a url). She enters a plan description 
for realisation, including a resource and an office (executive role). She then 
posts a link to her proposal (&quot;position&quot; in Votorola terms) to her forums and 
tries to get support and feedback. People start to vote for her proposal.

Story card 2:

Bob sees Alice proposal and has some ideas about adjustments. He forks 
(clones) her proposal and makes changes, but keeps voting for her. The system 
creates a difference view on the two documents. He uses an url to reference 
the changes and posts them in the forum of Alice and her peers and explains 
his reasons. Alice likes the changes and &quot;patches&quot; them in. Bob keeps voting 
for her proposal.

Story card 3:

Tom wants to support Alice and votes (applies) for an office defined in 
Alice's plan. He also pledges 10 hours labour per month to support the plan. 
The system shows this progress and new fulfilment of Alice's plan.

Story card 4:

Frieda does not like Alice' proposal at all. She creates a new proposal and 
changes it to oppose the plan of Alice. She also posts it in her forums to 
drum up support for it. People start to vote for her, some try to reach 
consent with Alice and start a dialogue.

We should keep it minimal, but parts of that are already implemented in 
Votorola (besides the resources and offices which exist as practices).


&gt;<i> &gt; I can also imagine something like Kickstarter where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people collectively raise resources to match a budget and then execute the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plan together. (1) The platform would be open (source) and community run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, what I have in mind would need a funding platform...something like
</I>&gt;<i> Kickstarter, but &quot;open (source) and community run&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mike and me have lately talked about a production process where the amount
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of labour and materials supplied to the machine works like consent, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more you support a process, the more comes out of it. (This can also be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hooked into discussion forums, ofc. and would be transparent.) This would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even be something like a living machine, cybernetics with collective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consciousness. The electronics have become incredibly cheap for this,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ~40$ for a Raspberry Pi, which I already have here and can wire up to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware. I don't what production/logistics machinery you have though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is where I get a little lost. Maybe you could explain a bit more of
</I>&gt;<i> what this is, or would look like.
</I>
I mean that the machines are coupled to the continuous funding process and 
labour on the machines is reflected in the tool. This means that the real 
world gets wired to the platform. That was all and this is already practice in 
business management/production tools today, it is just not public and often 
very complected.

Does that help?

(1) a very nice example of how this works is here:
