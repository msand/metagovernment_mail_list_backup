<PRE>When people ask me what our group is, I often fumble: trying to boil down our huge number of radical concepts into something that is to them a brand new idea.

So I realized I need to develop an &quot;elevator pitch.&quot; In case you're unfamiliar with the idea, it's the scenario where you're in an elevator with someone and you have until the elevator reaches their stop to convince them your idea is worthwhile. The elevator pitch is, by necessity, going to gloss over a lot of detail. It's a sales pitch, and it should be ~30 seconds long. 

So, I've made a few drafts and come up with the following (which I think still needs to be shorter). Let me know what you think, and/or how it could be improved and/or what your elevator pitch is.


METAGOV ELEVATOR PITCH:

Every time we vote someone into power, we lose all control over the decisions they make until the next time we get to vote. Metagovernment is a global group of people creating internet tools that let you delegate your vote to whomever you want, withdraw it whenever you want, or keep it for yourself and vote directly on the issues that matter most to you.

By their nature, these tools don't work with a majority rule system. Instead, they use a sophisticated consensus model. Computers and internet connectivity really help with that. The amazing thing is, when people are forced to work together to create a solution that works for everyone... they do! And these solutions are much stronger, better, and longer-lasting than the decisions made by small groups of representatives who inevitably make political compromises, if not purely selfish decisions.

We're not expecting our tools to take hold in national governments at first. But voting for representatives happens in many different communities we're involved in: social clubs, nonprofit organizations, homeowner associations, community groups, school boards, and so on. We expect our tools to take foot in the smallest communities, and expand from there as people get used to the idea of taking control of -- and thus responsibility for -- their democracies.
