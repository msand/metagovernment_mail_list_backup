Dear Mr. Coffman,

Thank you for your email of July 9, 2013. 
I have been on the Board of Directors for nine years and have never experienced a vote of the Directors when we needed to use the 2/3&#8217;s majority vote option.  On a few occasions we have had a member &#8220;stand aside&#8221; over an issue that they might not personally agree with, but didn&#8217;t feel it was an important enough issue to block the vote.

 -Are there any particular issues/situations that have repeatedly triggered the use of the 2/3&#8217;s majority &#8220;emergency vote&#8221; clause?

-There are none that I know of.

 -Could you briefly describe the outcomes that followed decisions made by

 a 2/3&#8217;s majority vote?

-This is not applicable, as there has not been use of the 2/3&#8217;s majority &#8220;emergency vote&#8221; clause.

 -Also, if you care to offer any further insights into this aspect of your decision making process, that would be most appreciated.

-Several thoughts that I have that might be helpful include the following:

    1.  We have a policy and procedure on Consensual Decision Making that we review.

    2.  Every year we have Board of Director elections.  If a new Director is voted in, we have an orientation for that new Director of all Policies and Procedures.

    3.  When an item is placed on the agenda or the Consent Agenda each Board Director is responsible for reviewing the issue.  The Director who places it on the agenda is the Sponsor of the item.  Any Director who has concerns should contact that person for clarification.  If the concern is not clarified satisfactorily, it is pulled from the Consent Agenda so there can be a full discussion.  Sometimes, if there is not adequate time for discussion, it will be placed on the following month&#8217;s agenda.

     4. One important fact that we learned is there is rarely an issue that we need to vote on that is a crisis or emergency.  Thus, it is prudent to take enough time to get additional information to add to the discussion until everyone is reasonably comfortable with it. This could mean     we could reschedule it to a future meeting.

     5. We also use a professional facilitator in our discussions, which is very helpful.  

     6.  One issue that I personally find helpful is a discussion regarding the different communication style of different Directors.  Some of us are extroverts others of us are introverts.  Extroverts often think quickly and &quot;loudly&quot; and want to come to a quick decision and not let process happen. Introverts often need more time to ponder the issue and to formulate their responses.  A superior decision is made when all Directors have adequate time to process the information regardless of their communication style.

      7. I am not pretending that our process is always smooth.  Conflict can be healthy as long as we make sure we go through conflict resolution that is critical for our ability to meet the many needs of our owners and Co-op.

Sincerely,

Gwyneth Bowman, AFC Board of Directors President

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Ashland Co-op Board members,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I live in Ashland and have been a Co-op member for 25+ years.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm associated with a small group of e-Democracy theorists and software developers who are designing and building toolsets + platforms + processes for a new, and hopefully, more evolved democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because the Co-op has been so successful over the years, some of us would like to inquire into a certain aspect of the Board of Directors decision making process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is currently a discussion in our forum with respect to the merit of *voting* vs. engaging in *rational discourse* until a consensus can be reached.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the Co-op By-laws (section 5.5) use of a 2/3's majority *emergency vote* is permitted if &quot;diligent efforts have failed to produce a consensus and the issue requires immediate action...&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding this *emergency vote* clause, we are curious to find answers to the following questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - How often does the Co-op BOD find itself in a position where it is unable to &quot;reconcile differing points of view based on the best interests of the Co-op&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Are there any particular issues/situations that have repeatedly triggered the use of the 2/3's majority *emergency vote* clause?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Could you briefly describe the outcomes that followed decisions made by a 2/3's majority vote?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if you care to offer any further insights into this aspect of your decision making process, that would be most appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you so much,
</I>&gt;<i>
