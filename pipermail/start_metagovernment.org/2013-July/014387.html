<PRE>Hi Mike,

    Ned&gt; So do you have any problems with the distinction drawn between
    &quot;naked voting&quot; and &quot;discourse voting&quot;? (Votorola uses naked voting.
    Blinap uses discourse voting.)

    Mike&gt; I'm afraid neither of these terms is meaningful to me.

Ned&gt; So, I will try again ... Except that I am now thinking to 
substitute &quot;proposing&quot; for &quot;discourse voting&quot;. So, the distinction is 
between &quot;naked voting&quot; and &quot;proposing&quot; (with the understanding that the 
proposal constitutes a vote, and is made in the context of discourse).

A proposal submits itself to criticism and systematic examination. A 
proposal presents good reasons to implement the proposal, or at least 
promises that good reasons exist and could be requested. Even in the 
case that the proposal springs from a subjective preference, the 
subjective preference is publicly revealed, and may through discourse be 
counter-balanced, or balanced in relation to wider consequences.

A &quot;naked vote&quot; responds to a proposal without itself being a proposal. 
It has no &quot;rational discourse clothes&quot; on. It expresses a preference 
without presenting or promising reasons for that preference. It does not 
submit itself to criticism and systematic examination. It cannot 
effectively be challenged through rational discourse, since it is but a 
raw, naked, inarticulate &quot;grunt&quot; of preference.

&quot;Communicative rationality&quot; is communication that is &quot;oriented to 
achieving, sustaining and reviewing consensus -- and indeed a consensus 
that rests on the intersubjective recognition of criticisable validity 
claims&quot;. A proposal constitutes such communication. A &quot;naked vote&quot; does 
not constitute such communication.

So, is this distinction between a &quot;proposal&quot; and a &quot;naked vote&quot; now 
meaningful to you? If not, please &quot;play the game&quot; of rational discourse: 
explain to me as best you can why the terms and the distinction that I 
have proposed are not yet meaningful to you. (Don't just give me a 
&quot;naked vote&quot;   :-)
