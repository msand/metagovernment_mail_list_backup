<PRE>Hi Ned and List,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; Gents, this is no way to talk to each other. Please refrain.
</I>&gt;<i>     [referring to Conseo's post ...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     conseo said:
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; @Ned
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; You jump to your solution without asking ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Mike, I greatly appreciate your readiness to step in as
</I>&gt;<i> facilitator/moderationer, and I generally agree with your sentiment and
</I>&gt;<i> your suggestion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And also, having seen Conseo's contributions over the past few years, I
</I>&gt;<i> know that he is deeply committed to trying to make the world a better
</I>&gt;<i> place, and that he has a lot to bring to the community, and that there
</I>&gt;<i> is really no danger of him getting stuck in rant mode. All of that puts
</I>&gt;<i> me on his side even when he is against me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen it in myself and in others that sometimes a full-on
</I>&gt;<i> from-the-heart verbal explosion can be a creative cathartic catalyst for
</I>&gt;<i> profoundly valuable new insights and understandings. Whatever energizes
</I>&gt;<i> is good, to the extent that the energy is then used well. I take no
</I>&gt;<i> offense at anything he has said, and if he finds the mode of expression
</I>&gt;<i> useful, I have no problem with serving further as &quot;lightning rod&quot;.
</I>
Very gently said, indeed you manage the soft-powers of discourse with its 
formal inclusiveness well. True, you were a lightening rod, the critique I 
have put out applies to most of the e-dem community (german pirate party, 
metagov, all kinds of ngo/ startups and projects) I have met since I decided 
to help people politically with a computer  instead of a party where I was 
before (not the pirate party) or some movement alone (where I have 
participated a few times). I also still read plenty of newspapers and history, 
do you? I knew the critique and problems of idealism before joining the e-dem 
community both from political practice and from philosophy and critical theory 
as well as these real world experiences. After much frustration about the 
state of things here, I have put some effort in understanding the coop scene 
better in the last half year and tried to focus on people who already practice 
democracy everyday (in contrast to us) and understand how things work on the 
ground today.

Mike has told me that it was in no way appropriate for this list to rant like 
this and I agree from my understanding of metagov that this cannot look like 
anything but an insulting and childish rant. Yet, critique is negative and 
this is totally missing here (children after all speak the truth bluntly often 
and it can be very destructive). In fact this was very much my point, that 
this community seems to avoid politcal reality and prefer to stick to 
everyone's self to not get it's theories hurt, which gives it a totally 
different interest in democracy than the people have on the ground, because 
they really need it and have to act even if their theory is stupidly simple 
from the eyes of the great politician/theorist. 

Stephen has painfully remembered me that political activists ridicule (and 
they really do, I have talked to experienced Occupy or 15M people and they are 
right in many ways, if they even talk to me) us as long as we make up ideas 
without experience as his major problem with metagov + he is/was interested in 
cooperating on the coop idea and then Ned has approached reality again and 
again from theory, which just takes time and can undermine the practical 
effort (unless I would ignore him completely although he has addressed me and 
Stephen again with his theory, would that have been better?). I also made this 
problem very clear before ranting. Since he proposed to abandon the BOD, I 
actually don't want to take part in the discussion anymore, because the coop 
will immediately know that this discussion is not worth the effort, especially 
if they really look on the list and the discussions.
This just destroyed the last thing I hoped could come out of this community, 
some practical cooperation with real practice and learning from the &quot;dumb&quot; 
people by helping them. The whole NGO scheme without a practical problem and 
again making up our own institutions depressed me really. As if we had 
something to offer to the people and not the other way around.

In every discussion here at best different theories claim to be true and 
people leave each other again, everybody is thinking they are right but being 
unable to even explain their opponent in the opponent's terms or show 
practically that they are wrong. This is no problem as long nobody really 
wants to cooperate on anything or get involved in some dumb political issue, 
but this defies metagov and a lot of the e-dem scene for me then. The whole 
gentle discourse theory safeguarding that is part of the problem, not a 
safety-net for conflict then (which sometimes is necessary). This also is 
classical for idealist discourses.

For me it has become clear that cooperating on practical issues probably won't 
happen here as it hasn't happened for the well-known problems I have ranted 
about. I have been gently hoping for more than two years that something real 
in this sense would happen in this community to prove me and my overly 
critical theory wrong. I have similar problems with Mike often, although we 
can at least agree on practical common ground to work upon (we also both know 
what it means to work on this stuff technically as a worker). Nontheless it 
seems to me that the formalisms applied here to factor out negativity which 
would come in if we really put our ideas to everyday tests are intended to 
avoid exactly this practice. There is already plenty of criticism in that 
direction towards Habermas and these moral and legalist theories for ages, but 
it still applies here, I have learned now. I have pointed out 
philosophical/social theory, so that you can't say I am just putting dumb 
practice first without theory or am just rambling. This is not what I am 
talking about, I am talking about the union between theory and practice. 
History does not work in a quiet discoursive manner and such theories become 
very much ideology, if they are applied that way. Hence my attack on Habermas 
as the great philosopher of international institutions and academic discourse 
in state of ever greater suffering and inequality.

I apologize for picking Ned and not keeping it a general rant. He was what 
forced me to finally realize that practically cooperating on metagov is 
totally unrealistic, because real practice is dangerous to all the theories 
accumulated here. They could all vanish in an instant, if people apply 
something different (which they already do in some places and which could show 
that not much of the theory is necessary). I don't care about such theories, 
but you seem to do only. 

I hope for the sake of us all that some cooperation comes out of metagov and 
the e-dem community in general, but I will stay passive here, avoid these 
discussions and search real applications and theory fitting that. If you want 
to talk to me, just address me and I will still reply if we can cooperate 
practically. I am sorry if I have disturbed your quiet thinking. I will not do 
it again.

conseo

P.S.: I could have done some cool and very powerful logic programming instead 
of this rant, which would have been much more fun for me and was actually 
productive.
