<PRE>Hi Conseo,

I feel sad (and a bit confused) by your recent posting. It was never my intention to ridicule you...or anyone else (I think you are referring to my post from last week???). I have the utmost respect towards you (and the others) for what you are developing....even though I don't always understand the depth and breath of *it*. What I wrote was meant to be constructive feedback ....but I can see how it may have come off as negative criticism. My sincerest apologies if what I wrote felt that way to you (or anyone else).

I often feel inadequate in my understanding of so much of the historical, conceptual, theoretical language being used on this list. I want to...but I just don't have the same education/ background. Or maybe I'm just not as bright, or patient, or .....?

And I have an opinion/belief/judgement that if I can't grok *it*...then most of the rest of the population won't be able to either. Perhaps I have too high an opinion of myself...or too low an opinion of others. It seems to me like *it* needs to be simpler if *it* is ever going to see the light of day. But I'm not a developer...or a scholar. I don't have the same background and insight that you, and the others, have. 

What I believe I do share with you is a deep desire and commitment to create a better world. And an interest in developing and online/computer based interface of some kind to achieve that end. I'm very open to learning/helping more and appreciate much of what you have posted (including your recent &quot;rant&quot;). I'm really trying to get up to speed because I want to be able to work with you (all).   Please be patient with my *uneducated idealism*.

As far as the Co-op proposal goes...it is/was never my intention to &quot;abandon the BOD&quot;. I don't see the BOD as being separate from the *membership at large*. They are all *the Co-op* in my mind. Maybe I'm not understanding what you mean(t) by &quot;abandon&quot;. I'm real clear that any *proposal* would need to be presented to, and approved by, the BOD first. I don't see the point in approaching it otherwise. That said, I don't see involving the membership at large in the day to day mundane decisions of the staff, or BOD, as I think that could be quite cumbersome. 

What I'm imagining is something ALL members would be able to collaborate on as an *outward* focus towards the greater community.

Maybe you could describe what you had in mind as a &quot;...practical cooperation with real practice and learning...&quot;? I don't see that as being any different from what I have in mind.
