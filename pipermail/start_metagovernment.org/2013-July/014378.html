<PRE>Hi Mike,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; The need is to inform the deciders of what the decision ought
    to be. Do the deciders already have this knowledge on your &quot;planet&quot;,
    as you put it? 

Ned&gt; On my planet (the name of which is &quot;Freetimea&quot;, by the way) each 
and every sentient being is equally a decider (on equal footing).

Each and every decider is free to participate in making any 
authoritative decision that is made.

There is no lower &quot;guidance-only&quot; class of individuals that are barred 
from directly participating in authoritative decision making.

Deciders are not agents, that need to be told by others what the 
decision ought to be.

Each decider becomes informed concerning what the decision ought to be 
through whatever means the decider chooses. Each decider decides 
autonomously what the decision ought to be, and then presses for that 
decision through the discourse that determines the decision.

Any guidance among deciders occurs informally. (&quot;Mortimer! You moron! 
Stop saying things that make me feel embarrassed to be seen with you in 
public!&quot;)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does this provide enough information to enable you to answer further? 
(If not, please give me some guidance regarding what else you need ...)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, a brief preamble:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike, I greatly appreciate you ability to &quot;stay with it&quot; in these

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We are both english speakers, but we are so far out on the edge of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> newly possible that standard english hasn't got there yet. In this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread (I now see), we are going to be dealing with those kinds of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues, which will compound the difficulty of trying to discuss some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamental differences in perspective and objective. Fastening
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seatbelts at this point would be appropriate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  Votorola is trying to systematize &quot;primary guidance&quot;, as something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separate from and applied to &quot;authoritative decision&quot;. I will now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contend (provisionally, as a &quot;poking with ten foot pole&quot; move) that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guidance should not be systematized.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  Systematizing guidance creates a *SYSTEM*. It would be better for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guidance to spring directly from the (unsystematized) lifeworld, and be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applied through the direct participation of individuals of the general
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public in authoritative decision making.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Mike&gt;  Primary guidance and authoritative decision. These are two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      categories of system, each with a different purpose. The purpose of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      the first is to guide the second. Discourse belongs to the first.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  I would say that we would be much better off if authoritative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions were made through discourse.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  And I would say that we don't need a separate primary guidance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system. To have such a system would be unnecessary, expensive, wasteful,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and distracting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Mike&gt;  But there are alternatives, and I think you want to say,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      &quot;Primary guidance should be effected by discourse and the unforced
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      force of reason, not by mass manipulation, money and power.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I want to say is: &quot;Authoritative decisions should be effected by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discourse and the unforced force of reason, not by mass manipulation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> money, and power. Primary guidance of deciders should be effected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through the (unsystematized) lifeworld.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Ned&gt;  I understand that a population could choose to have these two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      separate systems, related as you suggest. Do you understand that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      population could choose *not* to have these two separate systems,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      but rather to have only an authoritative decision making system,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      without a primary guidance system?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Mike&gt;Yes, if the decisions are reached by sortition. Sortition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      decisions cannot usefully be guided or otherwise influenced.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Guidance is only useful when the decisions are a matter of choice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      (voting). Then the deciders will want to know what choice to make.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      The source of their knowledge is what I call &quot;primary guidance&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  Mike, that to me is an amazing paragraph. Wow. Not only are we not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the same page, we are not on the same planet. (I am saying this not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to disparage but to emphasize -- the scale of our differences is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remarkable.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  That you should think that the only way to dispense with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> primary guidance system would be for authoritative decisions to be made
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by sortition -- I am having trouble wrapping my head around that. So is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it your position that, /a priori/, direct democracy is not only not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible, but not even conceivable?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  On my planet (which is definitely conceivable), &quot;the deciders&quot; are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the general public. Each individual decider in the population has his or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> her own &quot;primary guidance&quot;, from within and from without. There is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single systematized source for that primary guidance. Following that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guidance, each individual decider is free to participate in making any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authoritative decision, on equal footing. Participation occurs through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discourse. The authoritative decision is reached through discourse.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  On your planet, it sounds like the distinction between governors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and governed is cast in concrete. I would recommend that you consider
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> moving to my planet. My planet has a lot more flowers, on account of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having fewer bomb craters and toxic waste dumps.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Ned&gt;  Would it be possible for you to briefly list the reasons that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      you think the two-system arrangement is better than a single-system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      arrangement?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Mike&gt;  Consider the case in which primary guidance (knowing what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      choice to make) is based on reason. By contrast, recall that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      decisions are based on force (the essence of their decisiveness).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  You ask me to recall that decisions are based on force. I honestly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have no idea what you are talking about here. I have no such recollection.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  I understand that, once an authoritative decision has been made,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> force might be used in implementing the decision. But the making of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authoritative decision need not involve force, and in a discourse-driven
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direct democracy never would involve force.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  About the only circumstance that comes to mind in which *making* an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authoritative decision would involve force would be the Godfather Movie
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Your brains or your signature will appear on this paper&quot; sort of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> circumstance. Having a separate &quot;primary guidance&quot; system would do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing to forestall that sort of occurrence.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Mike&gt;  Now the problem arises that reason and force are incompatible;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      the two must be kept apart.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  Wait ... What? No!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not only are force and reason not incompatible, we always *want* force
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be reasonable. Can you provide further elaboration of what underlies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this (to me) very odd view that the two are incompatible?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Mike&gt;  So we have separate systems each dedicated to its own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      function, then bring them into proper relation with each other:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          (reason and knowledge) --&gt;  (force and decision)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      These two cannot be combined without destroying one, or the other.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  Again, we are on different planets. We are so far apart I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even know what questions to ask ... :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  I would cast the proper relation as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      (reason and knowledge) --&gt;  (decision) --&gt;  (reason and knowledge and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      force)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  You say the two systems cannot be combined without destroying one,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or the other. Would it be possible for you to describe the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nature/mechanisms of the destruction(s), and the results of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> destruction? (If you could give examples, that would be really great.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Mike&gt;  The crucial thing to avoid is systematically interlinking the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      two, e.g. by forcing the guidance processes to dance to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      decision-making drum.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  Can you discuss what it would be like for the guidance processes to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dance to the decision-making drum? (If you could come up with some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> examples of that happening, that would be great.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  For me, this has been a safari to a very foreign land -- great stuff!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
