<PRE>Ned Conner said:
&gt;<i> ... You appear to have defined &quot;to vote&quot; as &quot;to make a formal
</I>&gt;<i> choice&quot;. Whenever a person makes a formal choice, using any means of
</I>&gt;<i> expression, in any context, having any sort of effect, the person
</I>&gt;<i> has voted. (Yes?)
</I>
Yes.  We only say &quot;vote&quot; when multiple persons are involved in the
choosing, but technically any formalized choice is a vote; a single
signature on an executive order is technically a vote.

&gt;<i> I have been using the terms &quot;vote-driven&quot; and &quot;discourse-driven&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> distinguish two different methods of decision making. You now appear
</I>&gt;<i> to be saying that, by your definition of &quot;to vote&quot;, both of these
</I>&gt;<i> methods involve voting. ...  So, you tell me: what terms shall we
</I>&gt;<i> use to distinguish these two different methods of decision making?
</I>
I'll try.  First consider the following distinctions:

(1) Voting and sortition.  These are alternative forms of decision
making.  But discourse is excluded here, because it's not a form of
decision making, because it can't be decisive.  To talk about
discourse, we need to shift to a different category of system, and
different distinctions.

(2) Primary guidance and authoritative decision.  These are two
categories of system, each with a different purpose.  The purpose of
the first is to guide the second.  Discourse belongs to the first.
But there are alternatives, and I think you want to say, &quot;Primary
guidance should be effected by discourse and the unforced force of
reason, not by mass manipulation, money and power.&quot;

If so, then maybe we can work together at some point.  We both need
sustained baselines of discussion against which to test and develop
our supports (tools, practices, methods, etc).  I'm trying to create
one or two baselines here: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/in">http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/in</A>
Then we could introduce our supports (each his own) and try to raise
the quality of discussion to the level of discourse.  But first we
need these baselines of discussion.  They don't exist yet, so we have
to create them.  The work might interest you because it involves lots
of reasoned discussion and rationalization right from the beginning.
So please consider joining in.

Mike
