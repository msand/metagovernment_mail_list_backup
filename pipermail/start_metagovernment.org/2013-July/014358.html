<PRE>Hi Marc,

&gt;<i> I appreciate your current discussion a lot! But, I didn't get what
</I>&gt;<i> you mean by &quot;Baseline of Discussion&quot;! Could you explain this in more
</I>&gt;<i> detail, please?
</I>
Good question.  We need a proper definition.  Here's what I've put
together so far.  Let's call it a &quot;discursive baseline&quot;:

  A discursive baseline is a minimal level of discussion that is
  sustained as a developmental reference.  It is the &quot;lump of clay&quot;
  held by the discourse practitioner to which she gives shape, against
  which she judges the potential and progress of her work, and tests
  the need and efficacy of her tools.  It is a discussion with the
  following properties: (a) long lived, so the clay stays in the hands
  of the practitioner; (b) focused on the issue of an action norm,
  because such norms strongly depend on discursive validation; and (c)
  public, because only those affected by the action can rightly
  validate it.  These properties, plus any formal supports that are
  needed to sustain them, comprise the discursive baseline.

We seem to need this, but it doesn't exist anywhere, so I guess we
have to create it ourselves.  Anyway, this is my thinking.  Does it
make sense?
