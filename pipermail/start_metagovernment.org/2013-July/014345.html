<PRE>Hi Conseo, Michael, and Ned,

I just returned from a few days camping and am really appreciating the discussion you've been having while I was away. It definitely helps to further my understanding of the *practices and methodologies* you're developing.

I just sent that email to the Co-op Board of Directors and will let you know as soon as I hear back from them.

One real world &quot;growing tip&quot; problem the co-op has had for some time is a lack of sufficient parking. The co-op outgrew it's current location several years ago and a suitable solution is still in the works. This may be a practical starting point as the lack of sufficient parking is something most members experience when they go there to shop. And the store is often overcrowded during lunch and dinner shopping.

I'm feeling a little cautious though about approaching them from a &quot;let us help you fix your problems&quot; position. I don't think that approach would be as fruitful as one where we were offering them a chance to be *early adopters* of a new template for creative and collaborative co-operation. I'm thinking more like an *adding on* to what is already working than a *fixing* of what isn't....because the co-op &quot;ain't really broken&quot;, as Ned was suggesting. 

Also, it may be that they very rarely use the &quot;emergency vote&quot; clause that's permitted in their by-laws. We shall see.....

Either way, I think an approach where we offer them a chance *expand* their decision-making process to the membership at large in an *open and creative collaboration* would be way more attractive. Hopefully we can come up with something that stimulates their interest enough for them to give it a try.

I'll be in touch....

&gt;<i> Hi Conseo, (Great Post!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (As an aside, I appreciated and agree with your post on the &quot;Proposal to Ashland Co-op&quot; thread yesterday: it would be helpful to know some of the real world &quot;growing tip&quot; problems now facing the co-op, to use as concrete examples. (No pressure Stephen ...) :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; You have seen that Votorola is basically bolted on a
</I>&gt;<i>   Sematic-Media-Wiki (it is our DB and at the heart of the
</I>&gt;<i>   architecture + even shared by the metagovernment.org wiki)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Yes, I have. And, I could say a lot about the technical design of Votorola, but there would not be much point in doing so: my remarks would undoubtedly exceed your &quot;tldr&quot; attention span. (This post is already going to be redlining in that regard ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; Every requirement outlined above is covered by
</I>&gt;<i>   prototype-software on <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/">http://zelea.com/w/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; As Mike has pointed out to me in no uncertain terms, Votorola is not a decision system. It does not make decisions. The practice that I laid out to Stephen does make decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Also, the practice I was suggesting (a first step on a long road) involves no database functionality at all. Implicitly, I was merely suggesting that typing the text of proposals into wiki-pages would be a better choice than typing the text into emails or forum posts or blog entries.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Also again, the practice I was suggesting does not involve voting. The page to which you linked clearly says at the top:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Welcome to our pollwiki. This is a prototype of a multi-area
</I>&gt;<i>   pollwiki and streetwiki for deployment in an open voting network
</I>&gt;<i>   such as Outcast. 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; I admit that the homepage practices are distracting from
</I>&gt;<i>   this fact atm. because we have specified concrete possible practice
</I>&gt;<i>   applications for our new indirection feature in the delegational
</I>&gt;<i>   tree (pipes).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; There is no delegation in discourse-driven decision making. Participants participate through engaging in discourse. In that discourse, all voices (all proposals) are &quot;equal&quot; in the sense that it does not matter how many people are &quot;backing&quot; each proposal, either directly or through delegation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Communicative action is thus an inherently consensual form of social
</I>&gt;<i>   coordination in which actors &#8220;mobilize the potential for
</I>&gt;<i>   rationality&#8221; given with ordinary language and its telos of
</I>&gt;<i>   rationally motivated agreement. -- Stanford Encyclopedia of
</I>&gt;<i>   Philosophy: Habermas &lt;<A HREF="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; Our problem so far has been the lack of real users, not the
</I>&gt;<i>   lack of implementing your/our requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The primary requirement is that the decision be made through discourse, rather than through counting heads. Votorola does not make decisions, and uses voting and delegation to not make those decisions. Votorola does not make decisions through discourse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; I agree with you that the homepage is overwhelmingly complex
</I>&gt;<i>   as a result and we need to fix that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; You have my full empathy on that one: with my stuff, I have put great effort into trying to present it without the presentation being overwhelmingly complex, as yet with little success.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; But more generally you make up differences between
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;vote-based&quot; and discourse based systems very quickly, because all
</I>&gt;<i>   Votorola does in the different practices is route assent and
</I>&gt;<i>   document it publicly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In discourse decision making, there is no &quot;routing&quot; of assent. When there is no dissent, the process of reaching the decision is complete. The work is to resolve articulated objections through discourse, not to accumulate ever more &quot;like button&quot; assents through smiling at people or whatever.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; It is not per se a decision system or constructs indirect
</I>&gt;<i>   process, it does not calculate final results or determines winners.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; It really doesn't matter whether Votorola &quot;officially&quot; calculates final results or determines winners. In the sphere of polyarchy politics, the propaganda value of the Votorola numbers will be all that matters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Because (as Alex has suggested) directing power is power, Votorola (to the extent that it becomes popular) will function as yet another campaigning and lobbying group, along with the League of Women Voters and the American Association of Retired Persons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Because Votorola uses voting and delegation, the system can be easily gamed by the rich and powerful and well-connected and charismatic. (Examples of this will become available at the point that Votorola is operational, and has become popular enough to be worth gaming.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; (I could be wrong about all of this. These are my guesses. We will find out at the point that Votorola has become popular enough to matter.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; Generally speaking, every discourse system can result in
</I>&gt;<i>   decisions and every vote-counting system (e.g. boring quantitive
</I>&gt;<i>   ones) can spawn further public reflection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I agree that polling results can spawn valuable public reflection, and can serve as valuable input for discourse decision making. I also agree that it is a bad idea to use polling results as the sole input for decision making (which is what voting systems do).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; Discourse systems are of a very different quality though,
</I>&gt;<i>   because they give the user much more expressiveness and allow to
</I>&gt;<i>   find solutions by synthesis, as metagovernment has coined it with
</I>&gt;<i>   the dialectical term, and not the mechanism of the decision process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; (I don't quite understand this sentence ...) I agree that decision making through discourse is the best means we have (until the Vulcan Mind-Meld practice becomes more widely available) to try to reliably arrive at norms that synthesize the interests of all stakeholders.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; Votorola is designed with that at heart, the practices are
</I>&gt;<i>   only suggestions to help find common positions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Votorola (it appears to me) provides no support for decision making through discourse. There are various points (for example in Validity Seeking) that the system instructs: &quot;Go do some discoursing!&quot; but that is not, to my mind, the same as providing support for decision making through discourse. (Blinap does provide support for decision making through discourse.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; Making a decision is easy once you build consensus. This is
</I>&gt;<i>   the hard part though ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; For any particular decision, consensus is not built in a vacuum. Through discussing the initial proposal, and discussing objections to it, and discussing alternatives to it and the objections to those alternatives, agreement is eventually reached (or not). The agreement reached is the decision, and is the consensus. The process is not: &quot;first build consensus, then make decision&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; Our theoretically underlining practice is discussion and the
</I>&gt;<i>   soft force of better reasoning (to paraphrase Habermas' discourse
</I>&gt;<i>   theory, which we rely upon, see esp. the &quot;patch relaying&quot; practice).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I confess that, not infrequently, I find your interpretations and applications of Habermas ... breathtaking. When I look at the Patch Relaying practice, I see concepts that (to me) seem to have no connection to rational discourse or communicative action: &quot;candidate&quot;, &quot;local discussion&quot;, &quot;downstream&quot;, &quot;approval&quot;, &quot;patch application&quot;, &quot;branch&quot;, &quot;mirroring branch&quot;, and so on. At the same time, what I do not see are concepts that I *do* associate with rational discourse and communicative action, beginning with the concept of a proposed objection, and including objections to objections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; It is not meant as a voting tool in the way you see it to
</I>&gt;<i>   complement some party process or abstract arguments away with
</I>&gt;<i>   mechanical mathematical formula to calculate decisions or outcomes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Yes, I maybe kind of understand (and I understand why Mike goes back and forth between calling it a voting system and calling it a polling system). It is a &quot;simple&quot; polling/voting system that just counts heads. But then why does it need delegation? Delegation and discourse really don't go together. The kind of discourse that manifests communicative action is a discourse among equals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; All you do is mark your current preference (or stick to
</I>&gt;<i>   yourself) and use the collectively (publicly) gathered information
</I>&gt;<i>   to foster the discussion and push your perspective further, the core
</I>&gt;<i>   of the process is mutual *text* patching and referencing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Gathering and distributing all relevant information to all and only those who may be interested is a good example of the kind of support that discourse needs, and that Votorola does not provide. Text patching support is only one of many, many kinds of support that can be useful in preparing and distributing and responding to proposals. Again, where is the support for preparing and distributing and responding to proposed *objections* to proposals?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; Regarding your proposal, even just setting up a Wiki (not
</I>&gt;<i>   adjusting or developping new software) is significant admin work and
</I>&gt;<i>   without a defined need, especially off-site, highly likely to fail
</I>&gt;<i>   (ask Ed or Mike about the overhead).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Setting up a new group on wiser.org would be the work of an afternoon. The wiser crew would then handle all of the technical overhead, and they are good at it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; But I agree with you, and with Ed, that &quot;it is all about resources.&quot; Trying to engage in discourse through plain vanilla wiki-pages will be extremely labor-intensive. If the group is small enough, it would be much better to engage in discourse over beers down at the local pub.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Conseo&gt; I propose to wait for more information/clarification from
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen before we argue about design sketches. I don't think we are
</I>&gt;<i>   at odds unless we start to fight over ideas prematurely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Excellent! I heartily agree. (No pressure Stephen ...)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> These three forms of democracy can be distinguished:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     * Representative Democracy

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     * Discourse-Driven Direct Democracy
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A cursory reading of the Ashland Food Co-op bylaws suggests that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> currently the co-op is organized as a fairly standard polyarchy. The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> membership votes on a few matters, the Board of Directors (BOD) acts as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the representative assembly, and the General Manager (GM) acts as the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> chief executive. There is a little bit of vote-driven direct democracy
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> going on, but the BOD, the GM, and the various hierarchs below the GM
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> carry most of the weight of decision making. However (most thrillingly),
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> within the BOD deliberations (according to the &quot;emergency vote&quot; clause),
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there is some discourse-driven decision making going on -- WooHoo!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The practices of the Votorola model are *vote-driven* direct democratic
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> practices, which are intended to &quot;influence&quot; (not replace, not control)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> representative democracy forms (the BOD, the GM, etc.). The Votorola
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> model (so far as I have seen) contains no discourse-driven direct
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> democratic practices. (Various discourse practices are stuck on like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> post-it notes at various spots, but play no formal role in decision
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> making.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       IMPLEMENTING DISCOURSE-DRIVEN DIRECT DEMOCRACY
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It would be possible for the co-op to set up a fully functional
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discourse-driven direct democracy system, tomorrow. It could be set up
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in a wiki (a networked set of wiki-pages). Wiki platforms are readily
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> available, and the new system could run parallel with the existing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems, so that no initial changes to existing systems would be needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> From that beginning, the new system could grow and evolve organically.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The elements of the new practice might be these: (unless someone objected)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     * Anyone can propose, anything.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     * Each initial proposal goes into a new wiki-page.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     * Notification is sent to everyone who has expressed interest.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     * Objections (including reasons, perhaps including recommendations)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       are proposed (either into the original page, and/or into new pages
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       and then cross-linked).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     * The discourse (through successive, recursive proposing) continues
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       until there are no unresolved objections to the initial proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     * At that point, the initial proposal has &quot;passed&quot;, and is ready to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       be implemented.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In this system of decision making, it does not matter how many people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are &quot;for&quot; the proposal, or how many people are &quot;against&quot; the proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It only matters that there are *no unresolved objections* standing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;against&quot; the proposal. That is the fundamental difference between
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;vote-driven&quot; and &quot;discourse-driven&quot; decision making.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So, if you (Stephen) wished to get &quot;DDDD&quot; started within the co-op, you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could propose doing so to the membership, as outlined above.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You have seen that Votorola is basically bolted on a Sematic-Media-Wiki (it is
