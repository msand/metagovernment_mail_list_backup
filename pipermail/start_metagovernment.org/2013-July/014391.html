<PRE>Hi Mike,

    Ned&gt; ... I would say that we don't need a separate primary guidance
    system. To have such a system would be unnecessary, expensive,
    wasteful, and distracting.

    Mike&gt; The need is to inform the deciders of what the decision ought
    to be. Do the deciders already have this knowledge on your &quot;planet&quot;,
    as you put it?

    Ned&gt; Each decider becomes informed concerning what the decision
    ought to be through whatever means the decider chooses. Each decider
    decides autonomously what the decision ought to be, and then presses
    for that decision through the discourse that determines the decision.

    Mike&gt; I can't tell whether your answer is yes, or no. I wasn't
    asking about who the deciders are, but only about their knowledge.
    Do they already know what the decisions ought to be?

If my paragraph above (that was included in my answer) is not clear 
enough, you will need to give me some guidance on how to make it more 
clear. What do you not understand about how deciders acquire knowledge 
of what the decision ought to be?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  On my planet (the name of which is &quot;Freetimea&quot;, by the way) each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and every sentient being is equally a decider (on equal footing).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each and every decider is free to participate in making any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authoritative decision that is made.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is no lower &quot;guidance-only&quot; class of individuals that are barred
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from directly participating in authoritative decision making.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Deciders are not agents, that need to be told by others what the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision ought to be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each decider becomes informed concerning what the decision ought to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through whatever means the decider chooses. Each decider decides
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> autonomously what the decision ought to be, and then presses for that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision through the discourse that determines the decision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any guidance among deciders occurs informally. (&quot;Mortimer! You moron!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Stop saying things that make me feel embarrassed to be seen with you in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public!&quot;)
