I imagine the by-laws would accurately describe the (unusual) nature of whatever configuration Metagov came up with to organize it's (non-profit) business.
This could be described to potential donors as 'theory in practice'. It could be a positive descriptor/attractor and maybe an integral feature in some of the model(s) we are imagining as well.

The preponderant task (in my mind) would be for Metagov to decide who is going to be on the Board....and what their duties and powers will be.

And to answer Michael from another thread....

.....perhaps combining the development of the bylaws with a conversation about how Metagov intends to move forward as a non-profit would suffice. I can't imagine that taking less than several months. 

And, if we actually used *espoused methods/tools* to develop our collaborative vision/organization...well wouldn't that be make sense. And, it would be something to put in the portfolio when Metagov goes looking for grants.
