<PRE>Hi Mike,

And now (having created three new threads as spinoffs from this one), 
back to the question of this thread:

    Ned&gt; I have been using the terms &quot;vote-driven&quot; and
    &quot;discourse-driven&quot; to distinguish two different methods of decision
    making. You now appear to be saying that, by your definition of &quot;to
    vote&quot;, both of these methods involve voting.

    Ned&gt; So, you tell me: what terms shall we use to distinguish these
    two different methods of decision making?

Mike, please try again. Two terms. Focus. Many Many Thanks. (If you need 
to ask questions in order to come to your recommended two terms, by all 
means ask questions.)

</I>&gt;<i> I'll try.  First consider the following distinctions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Voting and sortition.  These are alternative forms of decision
</I>&gt;<i> making.  But discourse is excluded here, because it's not a form of
</I>&gt;<i> decision making, because it can't be decisive.  To talk about
</I>&gt;<i> discourse, we need to shift to a different category of system, and
</I>&gt;<i> different distinctions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Primary guidance and authoritative decision.  These are two
</I>&gt;<i> categories of system, each with a different purpose.  The purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> the first is to guide the second.  Discourse belongs to the first.
</I>&gt;<i> But there are alternatives, and I think you want to say, &quot;Primary
</I>&gt;<i> guidance should be effected by discourse and the unforced force of
</I>&gt;<i> reason, not by mass manipulation, money and power.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If so, then maybe we can work together at some point.  We both need
</I>&gt;<i> sustained baselines of discussion against which to test and develop
</I>&gt;<i> our supports (tools, practices, methods, etc).  I'm trying to create
</I>&gt;<i> one or two baselines here: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/in">http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/in</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Then we could introduce our supports (each his own) and try to raise
</I>&gt;<i> the quality of discussion to the level of discourse.  But first we
</I>&gt;<i> need these baselines of discussion.  They don't exist yet, so we have
</I>&gt;<i> to create them.  The work might interest you because it involves lots
</I>&gt;<i> of reasoned discussion and rationalization right from the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> So please consider joining in.
