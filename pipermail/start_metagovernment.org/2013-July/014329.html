<PRE>Hello Ned,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stephen, the program of development that you are proposing strikes me as
</I>&gt;<i> really, really good stuff. But to do all of that development just to run
</I>&gt;<i> a local grocery store that already has an excellent system (&quot;if it's not
</I>&gt;<i> broke, don't fix it ...&quot;) would be like bolting a V-8 engine onto a
</I>&gt;<i> wheelbarrow to drive its front wheel.
</I>I don't understand how you come to this metaphor, but the point I made before 
about the coops is that they are part of the grassroots for democracy and have 
always explored possibilities and practices before they have caused political 
changes in the large (visible ones like the liberal revolutions, the civil 
rights movement, ecological movements, proletarian mass-strikes, etc.). (1)
Can you explain how a good democratic practice can be too strong for small 
scale action? Why not scale it up from there? Stephen has emphasized that the 
Coop is a vital hub for the whole community, not just a grocery store.
The coop is also not &lt; 100 people, where probably direct discussion and 
consensual action is best and little formal tech is needed.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest that Ed has just given us a much more appropriate target
</I>&gt;<i> for all that development. If it takes him three months to create the
</I>&gt;<i> first 501c3 foundation for us to direct, that means that we have three
</I>&gt;<i> months to have operational a collaborative governance system capable of
</I>&gt;<i> directing it. The aim would then be to evolve that initial
</I>&gt;<i> community-scale system into a global-scale system capable of directing
</I>&gt;<i> any number of national foundations, anywhere.
</I>Solving which problem again? Why should anybody except (people like) us care 
for these foundations? Even then the problem persists that E-Dem projects have 
shown little cooperation in the past, as every group has its precious 
&quot;correct&quot; version of democracy and tries to succeed against others, which 
superficially is pretty absurd and shows that democracy alone is an 
ideological concept, not a practical one. This is the problem we have to solve 
imo.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone (including anyone from the Ashland Coop that is interested) can
</I>&gt;<i> participate in the scramble to get ready to direct the first foundation.
</I>&gt;<i> Those will be real users, working toward a real goal: to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> responsibly, wisely handle real money through a democratic decision
</I>&gt;<i> system open to all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This complects the problems and local issues of the Coop with a 
national/global foundation. I can't see how this helps the coop or 
bootstrapping our practices.

I don't have a fundamental problem with the foundational approach, but we will 
depend on third party funding from above instead of eating our own dogfood and 
being supported by those people who live our processes. This often has proven 
as dangerous, as it is convenient to go the easy route until the funding 
stopps and we fail bitterly.
I still think collecting successful examples of application and experiences to 
reference for bigger practices are vital and should have priority. What 
concretely can the foundation do, beyond taking funds and paying some 
activists (which very well might not work btw.)? 
On the other hand, if we had successful application examples, funding also 
could relate to it directly, make us more independent and help driving the 
foundational process.

P.S.: In general it would be nice if you could reference the sources of your 
thoughts and keep conversation more focused, as the discussions are often 
tldr; for me. I think there is value in your thoughts, but it is too unfocused 
and too much work to puzzle it all together.
