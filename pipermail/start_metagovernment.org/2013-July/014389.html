<PRE>&gt;<i> A &quot;naked vote&quot; responds to a proposal without itself being a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.  It has no &quot;rational discourse clothes&quot; on. It expresses a
</I>&gt;<i> preference without presenting or promising reasons for that
</I>&gt;<i> preference. It does not submit itself to criticism and systematic
</I>&gt;<i> examination. It cannot effectively be challenged through rational
</I>&gt;<i> discourse, since it is but a raw, naked, inarticulate &quot;grunt&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i> preference.
</I>
Okay, that's a good description.  I might not contrast &quot;naked vote&quot;
with &quot;proposal vote&quot;.  Proposals are just one possible form of
clothing for a vote; maybe insufficient on some occaisions; maybe
unecessary on others.  Consider instead the category &quot;clothed vote&quot;.

But again that's no stick to beat Votorola with, as I think you'll
learn if you continue reading the documentation.

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; So do you have any problems with the distinction drawn between
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;naked voting&quot; and &quot;discourse voting&quot;? (Votorola uses naked voting.
</I>&gt;<i>     Blinap uses discourse voting.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; I'm afraid neither of these terms is meaningful to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; So, I will try again ... Except that I am now thinking to 
</I>&gt;<i> substitute &quot;proposing&quot; for &quot;discourse voting&quot;. So, the distinction is 
</I>&gt;<i> between &quot;naked voting&quot; and &quot;proposing&quot; (with the understanding that the 
</I>&gt;<i> proposal constitutes a vote, and is made in the context of discourse).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A proposal submits itself to criticism and systematic examination. A 
</I>&gt;<i> proposal presents good reasons to implement the proposal, or at least 
</I>&gt;<i> promises that good reasons exist and could be requested. Even in the 
</I>&gt;<i> case that the proposal springs from a subjective preference, the 
</I>&gt;<i> subjective preference is publicly revealed, and may through discourse be 
</I>&gt;<i> counter-balanced, or balanced in relation to wider consequences.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;naked vote&quot; responds to a proposal without itself being a proposal. 
</I>&gt;<i> It has no &quot;rational discourse clothes&quot; on. It expresses a preference 
</I>&gt;<i> without presenting or promising reasons for that preference. It does not 
</I>&gt;<i> submit itself to criticism and systematic examination. It cannot 
</I>&gt;<i> effectively be challenged through rational discourse, since it is but a 
</I>&gt;<i> raw, naked, inarticulate &quot;grunt&quot; of preference.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Communicative rationality&quot; is communication that is &quot;oriented to 
</I>&gt;<i> achieving, sustaining and reviewing consensus -- and indeed a consensus 
</I>&gt;<i> that rests on the intersubjective recognition of criticisable validity 
</I>&gt;<i> claims&quot;. A proposal constitutes such communication. A &quot;naked vote&quot; does 
</I>&gt;<i> not constitute such communication.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, is this distinction between a &quot;proposal&quot; and a &quot;naked vote&quot; now 
</I>&gt;<i> meaningful to you? If not, please &quot;play the game&quot; of rational discourse: 
</I>&gt;<i> explain to me as best you can why the terms and the distinction that I 
</I>&gt;<i> have proposed are not yet meaningful to you. (Don't just give me a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;naked vote&quot;   :-)
</I>
