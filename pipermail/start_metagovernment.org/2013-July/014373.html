<PRE>Hi Mike,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, a brief preamble:

Mike, I greatly appreciate you ability to &quot;stay with it&quot; in these 
discussions, even when I am sure you are sometimes feeling just as 
frustrated as I am. :-)

We are both english speakers, but we are so far out on the edge of the 
newly possible that standard english hasn't got there yet. In this 
thread (I now see), we are going to be dealing with those kinds of 
issues, which will compound the difficulty of trying to discuss some 
fundamental differences in perspective and objective. Fastening 
seatbelts at this point would be appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ned&gt; Votorola is trying to systematize &quot;primary guidance&quot;, as something 
separate from and applied to &quot;authoritative decision&quot;. I will now 
contend (provisionally, as a &quot;poking with ten foot pole&quot; move) that 
guidance should not be systematized.

Ned&gt; Systematizing guidance creates a *SYSTEM*. It would be better for 
guidance to spring directly from the (unsystematized) lifeworld, and be 
applied through the direct participation of individuals of the general 
public in authoritative decision making.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; Primary guidance and authoritative decision. These are two
    categories of system, each with a different purpose. The purpose of
    the first is to guide the second. Discourse belongs to the first. 

Ned&gt; I would say that we would be much better off if authoritative 
decisions were made through discourse.

Ned&gt; And I would say that we don't need a separate primary guidance 
system. To have such a system would be unnecessary, expensive, wasteful, 
and distracting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; But there are alternatives, and I think you want to say,
    &quot;Primary guidance should be effected by discourse and the unforced
    force of reason, not by mass manipulation, money and power.&quot;

What I want to say is: &quot;Authoritative decisions should be effected by 
discourse and the unforced force of reason, not by mass manipulation, 
money, and power. Primary guidance of deciders should be effected 
through the (unsystematized) lifeworld.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; I understand that a population could choose to have these two
    separate systems, related as you suggest. Do you understand that a
    population could choose *not* to have these two separate systems,
    but rather to have only an authoritative decision making system,
    without a primary guidance system?

    Mike&gt;Yes, if the decisions are reached by sortition. Sortition
    decisions cannot usefully be guided or otherwise influenced.
    Guidance is only useful when the decisions are a matter of choice
    (voting). Then the deciders will want to know what choice to make.
    The source of their knowledge is what I call &quot;primary guidance&quot;.

Ned&gt; Mike, that to me is an amazing paragraph. Wow. Not only are we not 
on the same page, we are not on the same planet. (I am saying this not 
to disparage but to emphasize -- the scale of our differences is 
remarkable.)

Ned&gt; That you should think that the only way to dispense with the 
primary guidance system would be for authoritative decisions to be made 
by sortition -- I am having trouble wrapping my head around that. So is 
it your position that, /a priori/, direct democracy is not only not 
possible, but not even conceivable?

Ned&gt; On my planet (which is definitely conceivable), &quot;the deciders&quot; are 
the general public. Each individual decider in the population has his or 
her own &quot;primary guidance&quot;, from within and from without. There is no 
single systematized source for that primary guidance. Following that 
guidance, each individual decider is free to participate in making any 
authoritative decision, on equal footing. Participation occurs through 
discourse. The authoritative decision is reached through discourse.

Ned&gt; On your planet, it sounds like the distinction between governors 
and governed is cast in concrete. I would recommend that you consider 
moving to my planet. My planet has a lot more flowers, on account of 
having fewer bomb craters and toxic waste dumps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; Would it be possible for you to briefly list the reasons that
    you think the two-system arrangement is better than a single-system
    arrangement?

    Mike&gt; Consider the case in which primary guidance (knowing what
    choice to make) is based on reason. By contrast, recall that
    decisions are based on force (the essence of their decisiveness).

Ned&gt; You ask me to recall that decisions are based on force. I honestly 
have no idea what you are talking about here. I have no such recollection.

Ned&gt; I understand that, once an authoritative decision has been made, 
force might be used in implementing the decision. But the making of the 
authoritative decision need not involve force, and in a discourse-driven 
direct democracy never would involve force.

Ned&gt; About the only circumstance that comes to mind in which *making* an 
authoritative decision would involve force would be the Godfather Movie 
&quot;Your brains or your signature will appear on this paper&quot; sort of 
circumstance. Having a separate &quot;primary guidance&quot; system would do 
nothing to forestall that sort of occurrence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; Now the problem arises that reason and force are incompatible;
    the two must be kept apart. 

Ned&gt; Wait ... What? No!
Not only are force and reason not incompatible, we always *want* force 
to be reasonable. Can you provide further elaboration of what underlies 
this (to me) very odd view that the two are incompatible?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; So we have separate systems each dedicated to its own
    function, then bring them into proper relation with each other:

        (reason and knowledge) --&gt; (force and decision)

    These two cannot be combined without destroying one, or the other.

Ned&gt; Again, we are on different planets. We are so far apart I don't 
even know what questions to ask ... :-)

Ned&gt; I would cast the proper relation as:

    (reason and knowledge) --&gt; (decision) --&gt; (reason and knowledge and
    force) 

Ned&gt; You say the two systems cannot be combined without destroying one, 
or the other. Would it be possible for you to describe the 
nature/mechanisms of the destruction(s), and the results of the 
destruction? (If you could give examples, that would be really great.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; The crucial thing to avoid is systematically interlinking the
    two, e.g. by forcing the guidance processes to dance to the
    decision-making drum. 

Ned&gt; Can you discuss what it would be like for the guidance processes to 
dance to the decision-making drum? (If you could come up with some 
examples of that happening, that would be great.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ned&gt; For me, this has been a safari to a very foreign land -- great stuff!
