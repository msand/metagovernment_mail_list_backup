<PRE>Hi Stephen,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; How many times has the &quot;emergency vote&quot; clause been invoked
    since its inception? What were the matters voted on? What were the
    outcomes produced by the voting?

    Stephen&gt; To be thorough in answering your question I would need to
    go through 40 years of data/records that may or may not be so easily
    accessible. And a finding of the &quot;outcomes produced&quot; would very
    likely be someones limited and anecdotal interpretation of the
    events that followed an &quot;emergency vote&quot;. I think it would be a very
    interesting question to ask. I have a close friend who was president
    of the BOD for several years. I'll ask about this next time I see
    him and get back to you.

The Ashland Coop experiment has in a sense been been running discourse 
and voting parallel (through the Emergency Vote clause). If 
we-the-Metagovernment-community are now going to start directing 
foundations, one of the most fundamental questions we must agree on 
initially will be whether to use discourse only, voting, or some version 
of the Emergency Vote clause. This makes the experimental results 
produced by the Emergency Vote clause at the Ashland Coop over the last 
40 years of *extreme* and *immediate* interest. (!!!) Any information 
that you can provide about that will be *greatly* appreciated!

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Ned,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really appreciating your questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To make the implicit explicit, you are reporting that a social system 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design featuring private_ownership + voting + oligarchy + hierarchy 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has proved to be &quot;good enough&quot; as a way to organize and run a local 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grocery store, from your perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand your use of the terms &quot;private ownership&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;oligarchy&quot; in relation to a member owned co-operative that anyone can 
</I>&gt;<i> join, and which is governed by individuals who are elected by the 
</I>&gt;<i> membership to make decisions on behalf of the membership's interests. 
</I>&gt;<i> I /am/ stating that it seems to me this system/process has been very 
</I>&gt;<i> successful in organizing the Co-op membership toward reaching it's 
</I>&gt;<i> stated goals. Could it be more democratic and/or more effective?....I 
</I>&gt;<i> think that is very much worth looking into.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are you also proposing anything, and/or responding to my proposal? 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (My proposal is mainly concerned with public decisions at the scale 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of populations, but does have ramifications for local grocery stores.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to work with you, (and Conseo, and others), in developing 
</I>&gt;<i> a proposal that we could present to the membership of the Co-op. I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> working on a proposal 'outline' which I will be presenting (here) 
</I>&gt;<i> soon, in an effort to get things moving towards an actual proposal we 
</I>&gt;<i> can present. I like a lot of what you have put together in *Blinap* 
</I>&gt;<i> which I would like to see incorporated into the proposal. Let's (all) 
</I>&gt;<i> work together and see what we can come up with.

</I>&gt;<i> years. I'll ask about this next time I see him and get back to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My sense is that it would be best to begin from an assumption that the 
</I>&gt;<i> system/process used by our Co-op could very likely be improved, 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps in several ways....and that the improvements may, or may not, 
</I>&gt;<i> include an &quot;emergency vote&quot; clause/option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Has the store ever been picketed by protesters who had no better way 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to &quot;make their voices heard&quot; with respect to the decision making done 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the Elected Oligarchy In Charge?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Recently (in the past year or two) a half-dozen (or so) employees 
</I>&gt;<i> began a campaign to to encourage other employees to join a union. I 
</I>&gt;<i> saw them &quot;picketing&quot; outside of the store on a couple of occasions. I 
</I>&gt;<i> spoke with a few of them about their effort. As I understand it, they 
</I>&gt;<i> were wanting more *representation*, specifically regarding their 
</I>&gt;<i> relationship with the GM. I also spoke with several (non-protesting) 
</I>&gt;<i> employees who thought that joining a union was a really /bad/ idea. I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't know if this effort is still underway....I don't' think that it 
</I>&gt;<i> is.  And the general manager has recently retired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there had been an organized membership network/system/process in 
</I>&gt;<i> place, it could very possibly have led to successful &quot;communicative 
</I>&gt;<i> action&quot;, such that their grievances were alleviated without having to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;protest&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are the paid staff enjoying being wage-slaves and working in a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hierarchy?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe so. I know many of the employees personally, some of whom 
</I>&gt;<i> have been on staff for as long as I've been shopping there (25 years). 
</I>&gt;<i> They love their job and I don't think they would describe themselves 
</I>&gt;<i> as being wage-slaves working for a hierarchy. The Co-op takes very 
</I>&gt;<i> good care of them. In a very tangible way, they /are/ the Co-op.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Would they prefer that the store be worker-owned rather than 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> customer-owned?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of them are members as well. It's not required for employees to 
</I>&gt;<i> be members....but the Co-op makes it very easy for them to join.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are the buildings and grounds of the store subject to zoning 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regulations? Are any of the items for sale by the store subject to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regulation? Do the store and/or its employees pay taxes? (If so, then 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the internal governance system of the store is not the whole story. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would you consider The Whole Story of the way the store is governed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be working pretty well?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Given that member ownership seems to be working well for the store, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do you think that member ownership would work well for planet Earth? 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (That is, all tangible property other than individual 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mind/body/spirit owned collectively by Humanity + Nature + Future 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Generations.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I don't see Humanity + Nature(Earth) + Future 
</I>&gt;<i> Generations as being separate from each other. Though, as a member of 
</I>&gt;<i> this mystical union, I am interested in taking better care of that 
</I>&gt;<i> which I am a part of.  And I think working together to develop a 
</I>&gt;<i> better process/system of governing this union with each other would be 
</I>&gt;<i> a /very/ good place to begin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Some of these questions will need their own threads ...)
