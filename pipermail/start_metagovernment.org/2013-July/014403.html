<PRE>Hi Mike,

    Ned&gt; The more we can work together, the more we can focus our
    efforts, the more support we will be able to attract, and the more
    and faster progress we will be able to make toward a better world.

    Mike&gt; Hopefully. Please keep my original offer in mind:

        Mike&gt; If so, then maybe we can work together at some point. We
        both need sustained baselines of discussion against which to
        test and develop our supports (tools, practices, methods, etc).

Ned&gt; In my mind, you and I are (and have been) working together, each 
time we exchange emails.

In the course of our exchanges, I have made several proposals, including 
these two:

    * I have proposed that we abandon &quot;naked voting&quot;, and switch to
      &quot;discourse through proposing&quot;.
    * I have proposed that we create a &quot;full&quot; direct democracy, and
      abandon hybrid systems such as polyarchy.

I do not need &quot;sustained baselines of discussion against which to test 
and develop supports (tools, practices, methods, etc).&quot; What I need is 
to reach agreement with others regarding &quot;what ought to be&quot;.

Ironically, what I am now proposing to you is that we (you and I and the 
community, including Stephen and the Co-op and anyone else interested) 
work together to reach agreement regarding &quot;what ought to be&quot;, before we 
plunge into deciding &quot;what will be&quot; (that is, slinging code). (My 
proposing this to you is ironic, of course, because it is your 
position.) :-)

There are big questions on the table; big choices to be made. If you 
value rational discourse, and the Discourse Principle, and acquiring the 
knowledge of &quot;what ought to be&quot; before deciding &quot;what will be&quot;, then you 
also should wish that we begin our work together by seeking agreement 
through discourse regarding &quot;what ought to be&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i>    Mike&gt; A discursive baseline is a minimal level of discussion that is

</I>&gt;<i>    held by the discourse practitioner to which she gives shape, against
</I>&gt;<i>    which she judges the potential and progress of her work, and tests

</I>&gt;<i>    validate it. These properties, plus any formal supports that are
</I>&gt;<i>    needed to sustain them, comprise the discursive baseline.
</I>&gt;<i> I am having trouble understanding the desirability of discussions that

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;product&quot; of a decision system is decisions made. The product of a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;guidance system&quot; is decisions guided. One primary aim of such systems 
</I>&gt;<i> (I would have thought) is to facilitate coming to agreement, as

</I>&gt;<i> to the extent that they serve that aim (among others). Even a guidance 
</I>&gt;<i> system needs to answer to practical considerations such as quickness 
</I>&gt;<i> and efficiency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are plenty of action norms to be set. It is not as if actually 
</I>&gt;<i> succeeding in reaching agreement with respect to any particular norm 
</I>&gt;<i> is going to put us out of business.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike, do you think that quickness and efficiency don't matter?
