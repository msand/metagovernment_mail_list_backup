Hi Conseo (and others),

I'll need some help answering the first question. I'm not clear what &quot;practices&quot; would fit the application I have in mind. 
I hadn't thought about this until you mentioned the idea a few days ago....please bear with me.

I think something like *e-democracy/communicative action* would really take off in Ashland. Our community is fairly progressive and the Co-op is well established as a major hub of our dynamic little town. I can imagine the Co-op membership putting something like this to good use....if it could all come together in a way that really works.

Here is what I have in mind:

I'm thinking to begin by gathering a small group of local Co-op members to help in the development of this proposal. I would also like to get help/feedback here (on this list) in order to put a proposal *outline* together. Specifically, I need more info regarding the selection of appropriate toolsets and &quot;practices&quot; as you say.

The way I see it...this proposal would advocate/suggest/recommend a process for the development of a more *evolved* form of organization/decision making for the Co-op membership.

Specifically, I'm thinking (we) would propose to the membership the adoption of a Network + Structure + Process.

The *Network* would simply be a subset of the Co-op membership....any member would be free to join in, or not.

The *Structure* would consist of the Network...a library/database/proposal genome...and a funding foundation.

The *Process* would facilitate the following:  proposal submission, appraisal + tagging + posting, communicative action/collaboration, agreement/decision making, funding (if necessary), tracking data, and so on.

Members can present proposals through the Process in order to steward the Co-op membership Network towards whatever they imagine would be a more evolved form of organization/decision making. This could include anything from mundane operational details of the store....to developing and funding projects that steward the larger community/bioregion in which we live. The Co-op already has a community grant program that funds local projects and organizations.

The proposals would be studied, verified, and tagged by &quot;appraisers&quot;, and then posted when/if they pass the requisite criteria for proposals (TBD).

An online platform (organized by the network) would be set up to make it easy for members to connect and engage with each other in developing and selecting those proposals they agree on and choose to give their support to. Toolsets/practices are provided to the membership in order to organize and facilitate their process of coming to agreement.

A foundation would be set up to fund the proposals that require it. It can receive grants, donations, and pledges (from members) generally, or specifically for individual projects, and disperse them according to the agreements of the membership.

The process would have some kind of rhythm to it which culminates in a celebration. Proposals wouldn't have to &quot;wait&quot; for a whole cycle to complete itself...but there would be a seasonal ritual element to it. I don't have this all figured out just yet.....I'm open to feedback.

So, in answer to your question regarding, &quot;which of our practices would be most useful&quot; for this situation?....I don't know. 
Maybe a combination of Validity Seeking, Consensus Bridging, and Legislative Action?
I'm not that familiar with the technical side of e-D. Maybe you could make a suggestion?

And please feel free to give any other feedback you think would be helpful....anyone.
