<PRE>Hi Mike,

    Mike&gt; Gents, this is no way to talk to each other. Please refrain.
    [referring to Conseo's post ...]

    conseo said:
     &gt; @Ned
     &gt; You jump to your solution without asking ...

Ned&gt; Mike, I greatly appreciate your readiness to step in as 
facilitator/moderationer, and I generally agree with your sentiment and 
your suggestion.

And also, having seen Conseo's contributions over the past few years, I 
know that he is deeply committed to trying to make the world a better 
place, and that he has a lot to bring to the community, and that there 
is really no danger of him getting stuck in rant mode. All of that puts 
me on his side even when he is against me.

I have seen it in myself and in others that sometimes a full-on 
from-the-heart verbal explosion can be a creative cathartic catalyst for 
profoundly valuable new insights and understandings. Whatever energizes 
is good, to the extent that the energy is then used well. I take no 
offense at anything he has said, and if he finds the mode of expression 
useful, I have no problem with serving further as &quot;lightning rod&quot;.
