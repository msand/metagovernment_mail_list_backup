<PRE>Hi Stephen,

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My question to Stephen and the Coop would rather be what they need to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine many (perhaps most) members would say the Co-op's process is *deep
</I>&gt;<i> enough* as it appears to be very open and successful already.
</I>Ok, I imagined that. It is steered by the base already.

&gt;<i> &gt; If the members are comfortable with the BOD, what point does it have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; push all 8000 people to drive decisions (if only a part does, things get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even worse than now) they rather delegate to the BOD?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't actually see pushing the membership at large into &quot;driving&quot; the day
</I>&gt;<i> to day decisions the *management* is currently making. I'm very comfortable
</I>&gt;<i> with the model the Co-op is currently using to run their/our business. 
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm imagining (as a possibility) is organizing the Co-op membership
</I>&gt;<i> into a network that can develop, approve, and fund projects for the good of
</I>&gt;<i> the community *at large*. As I said earlier, the Co-op already has a
</I>&gt;<i> community grant program that gives funding to organizations in the area
</I>&gt;<i> that are working on issues of social justice and environmental
</I>&gt;<i> sustainability, (etc). I'm seeing something that is a little larger...and
</I>&gt;<i> organized by the membership at large.
</I>Yes, this was my point, too. I would like to increase the reach and bridge in 
other issues to quickly demonstrate value and learn from experiences instead 
of the &quot;right&quot; theory and expand from that. Theory can help to remove 
structural barriers on the way though and can be explored by different 
(metagov) projects once a process is in place.

&gt;<i> &gt; How do you picture them to accept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and carry the practical burden of) this expectation of yours without a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concrete problem just for the sake of non-voting?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The world is full of concrete problems from the community level on up to the
</I>&gt;<i> global level. What I'm interested in is developing a model for organizing
</I>&gt;<i> creative and intelligent action that is directed towards finding solutions
</I>&gt;<i> to some of those problems. I'm not interested in doing this &quot;just for the
</I>&gt;<i> sake of non-voting&quot;.
</I>Me, too, this was my point towards Ned. Is there some issue/management system 
in place for the coop which could be extended in this direction (e.g. as a 
web-issue-tracker)?

&gt;<i> &gt; After all they have decided
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as *owners* to elect the BOD and can decide otherwise at any time. If you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really want to criticize coops you could study the critiques of Mondragon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imo, this would be at least helpful in context. (3)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I'm not interested in criticizing co-ops. I think they're great.
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to see a lot more of them.
</I>Ofc. me neither, but they have some structural problems (at least on the scale 
of Mondragon it becomes obvious), because they have to operate in a 
capitalistic environment, meaning they cannot democratically decide about the 
free market and have to compete with cheap/slave labour in part (many coops 
have a problem with NAFTA and other free trade agreements). I also would like 
to see a lot more, but this probably is not a linear development you can just 
continue without changing market economics and coming together on a bigger 
scale. But we don't have to worry about that now, I just wanted to mention 
that we could study coops organisations critically by example, if we wanted. I 
don't for now and haven't yet read named famous study.


&gt;<i> &gt; @Stephen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The parking lot is a good mundane example. Can this problem be solved by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the coop alone or do they need new ground for it? Can it be shared by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other groups?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just mentioned the parking issue because Ned asked what &quot;real world
</I>&gt;<i> 'growing tip' problems the Co-op&quot; was having. The Co-op is currently trying
</I>&gt;<i> to buy out the bank next door which would give them both more parking and
</I>&gt;<i> more square footage for the store. The bank would have to move obviously
</I>&gt;<i> and the City of Ashland has an ordinance that won't permit any more
</I>&gt;<i> drive-up window locations in town. This was legislated years ago to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> more fast food franchises from moving into town. Last I heard this idea was
</I>&gt;<i> going to be presented to the City Council for some kind of variance. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know the latest.....
</I>Ok. You are on the ground, whatever you think would make sense. This sounds 
very much like a legislative issue, something Votorola potentially was 
designed for. Maybe you can link us in some discussion forum over there to get 
more insights? I couldn't find any public ones on the homepage. I am also not 
familiar with your local legislative process, but can have a look into it, if 
it helps.

&gt;<i> &gt; Generally, can this issue or another one be exploited to foster democracy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and be more successful with it than without?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I'm not sure approaching the membership from a standpoint of &quot;let us
</I>&gt;<i> help you fix your problems&quot; would be the better option.
</I>Ok, I can understand that (because then you have to do the work theoretically 
and technically). I have some micromanagement/community-tool/wiki in mind, 
probably integrated in either social networks or mobile work-flows of the 
workers, open to outside contributions, whatever makes sense. It's difficult 
to judge from here. I know Scrum and agile concepts for bottom-up software 
development and project management. Votorola is also available. I could also 
have a look at similar coops here, probably after exams, and look if one can 
cooperate on production technology over the web similar to Open Source 
Ecology, for example. (2)

&gt;<i> &gt; How does the coop picture to endorse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democratic process and increase its reach? Opening up to the own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; membership
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; base can be an option, but only if it is interested and can bring value to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the table which the BOD cannot (e.g. voluntary labour).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, &quot;bringing value to the table&quot;.....I like that!  In my mind, that looks
</I>&gt;<i> like setting up an online member owned and organized network that can
</I>&gt;<i> propose, enact, and fund creative and collaborative solutions to make *the
</I>&gt;<i> community* a better place in which to live.
</I>Yes, something like that. Preferably hooked into something where the members 
and people of your whole community (town) already are, so they can get hooked 
in, if they want to. Again, do you have online forums or issue trackers (or 
does it all happen on FB)? I can also imagine something like Kickstarter where 
people collectively raise resources to match a budget and then execute the 
plan together. (1) The platform would be open (source) and community run 
though.
Mike and me have lately talked about a production process where the amount of 
labour and materials supplied to the machine works like consent, the more you 
support a process, the more comes out of it. (This can also be hooked into 
discussion forums, ofc. and would be transparent.) This would even be 
something like a living machine, cybernetics with collective consciousness. 
The electronics have become incredibly cheap for this, ~40$ for a Raspberry 
Pi, which I already have here and can wire up to hardware. I don't what 
production/logistics machinery you have though.

&gt;<i> &gt; What kind of outreach and external interface can be built
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to allow outsiders help with their problems to mutual benefit? (e.g. Urban
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gardening, composting, construction work, you name it). Are there online
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; processes where this could be hooked in? (e.g. forums or production line
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are exactly the questions I'm trying to answer. I need your (and
</I>&gt;<i> others) help with this!
</I>Ok, I hope my speculative ideas go in the right direction. The same level of 
criticism I put to others I can take very well myself (and have to get here), 
so don't be too gentle, it doesn't help our cause :-).

&gt;<i> &gt;  This is what I think is most interesting now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree. Let's figure something out...together!
</I>I am sorry to rant about this issue that much, it is especially because I care 
about coops for some time and have waited for a chance to get involved more 
practically. I don't mean it personally and I don't even know Ned enough 
personally to attack him in this sense, but I very well know this approach to 
society and this problem of e-dem projects now. If I wouldn't care I wouldn't 
be so serious about it as I have great fun in building software atm. Sadly you 
can't be friends with everybody unconditionally.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks so much!
</I>No problem. I help you, you help me. We help us.

(1) Maybe something like <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/p/budgeting">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/p/budgeting</A> (?) I 
can imagine a permanent budget which does not only track money but also labour 
and raw resources and allows members/contributors to constantly extend and 
fine grain it. It could also be combined with tracking the contributions to 
the production machines as votes, mentioned above. I had urban gardening in 
mind already. <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Conseo-Polyc0l0rNet/Mann/p/urgar">http://zelea.com/w/User:Conseo-Polyc0l0rNet/Mann/p/urgar</A> This 
could be done as a global green economy project or so.
