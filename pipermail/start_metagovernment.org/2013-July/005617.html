<PRE>Hi Conseo, Ned, Michael, (and others),
Below is an rough outline for a proposal to the Ashland Food Co-op to develop an online *Community Network*. (my vision/version of &quot;What Ought to Be&quot;).
You're comments are most welcome.
TIA,
Steve

This *proposal* is intended to gather approval and support for organizing a web-based *Community Network* within the membership of the Ashland Food Co-op (AFC) located in Ashland, Oregon, USA.

The purpose of this Community Network is to encourage any and all AFC member(s) to develop *proposals* that are oriented toward building and sustaining a vibrant local community, and then to submit their proposals to the Co-op membership for collaboration, funding, and support.

All proposals submitted to this Community Network would need to fit within certain (TBD) *categories and criteria*. 

These (TBD) proposal *categories* could include items such as: local organic farming and gardening; stewarding the watershed/bioregion; community health and well-being; caring for the homeless; sustainable energy and transport; community networking; local currency; green building; etc.

These (TBD) proposal *criteria* could include items such as: must follow the precautionary principle, must be open and transparent, must be community based and focussed, must have a clear outline for development, must have an explicit budget for any funds requested, etc.

Proposals would go through a process of *appraisal* to see if they fit these *criteria and category* constraints. If and when they pass appraisal they would be *tagged* and posted online.

*Appraisers* would be elected and trained by the Community Network.

A *tag* would list all relevant data of a given proposal (e.g. - it's category, date of submission, budget request, location, timing, associations, etc.) and link it to the member or members presenting the proposal.

If a proposal doesn't pass appraisal it would still be tagged and posted, but would not have access to the Networks tools and assistance for collaborative development and/or funding, until it was able to pass appraisal.

Any and all AFC members would be free to join the Community Network in order to: present their own individual proposal(s); track, collaborate in, and fund the development of proposals submitted by other members of the Network; and to network, interact, and associate with other individuals within the membership of the AFC Community Network.

Any AFC member would be free to make pledges of support (financial and/or in kind) to any proposal that has passed the appraisal criteria and been posted online. Their pledges would become due upon membership consensus of the proposal.

Membership consensus would be attained if there are no *reasonable objections* to the proposal one week following notification of a call for objections.

Determining which objections are *unreasonable* would be the responsibility of an elected body of the membership.....(perhaps the appraisers).

A Foundation would be set up to facilitate the funding transaction of proposals and to bestow any grants available to certain categories of proposal.

Those proposals attaining the consensus of the membership would become available for support and funding from the Foundation. 

The Ashland Food Co-op (and others) could offer grants to those proposals it felt best fit certain grant criteria. (e.g. - the greatest good for the greatest number.)

Grant recipients would be selected by the membership at large through a process of voting at the end of each cycle. A grant cycle would last for 6 months. Those proposals voted to receive grants would not need to wait for the end of the cycle in order to acquire any pledged funding/resources due to them upon reaching the consensus of the Network.

Any member who wanted to participate in the Community Network would need to develop an individual web page. The requisite minimum data for this page would be the members name and Co-op number. The Co-op number would be kept private if requested by the member, but would be used internally to verify Co-op membership, and to tag certain aspects of a members interaction, association, and participation within the Network for record keeping in the Database.

These individual webpages would be hosted by an *AFC Community Network website*.

The AFC Community Network website would make it simple and easy for individuals to present, search/locate, track, collaborate with, and support/fund those proposals a member found interesting and worthwhile. The website would also make it easy to connect with the Network community in order to share ones interest in, research data on, position towards, and relationship to, any proposal currently active in the Community Network.

The Community Network would establish a Database to track all relevant aspects of proposals up to the time of funding.

The Database would collect and make available data regarding those proposals any member was involved in presenting, developing, collaborating on, liking, or funding.

Any element of this process/structure could be changed at any time by a 3/4 majority vote of active users of the Network.

An active user of the Community Network is a member who has set up their individual/personal web page and participated in the development of at least one proposal in the year preceding the proposal for a process/structure change. This active user participation requirement begins one year following the institution of the Community Network. Until one year passes, any member who has *joined* the Network may vote on process/structure proposals.

On the Community Network website the membership would be able to interact with AFC staff through an online bulletin board linked to the website which posts comments, questions, and suggestions from members.....and answers/feedback from staff.  The staff could publish their newsletter and reports online as well. The BOD could post meeting dates and notes regarding the issues on their agenda.

This proposal will be submitted to the AFC Board of Directors (BOD) following the consensus of those collaborating on the development of this proposal.

This proposal will be submitted to the AFC membership at large following the consensus of the AFC BOD. 

The AFC Community Network would be the Beta test for an *City of Ashland* Online Community Network.

This proposed *Community Network* is intended to be a model that can be duplicated and scaled.

Anyone is welcome to comment on and/or participate in the development of this proposal.
