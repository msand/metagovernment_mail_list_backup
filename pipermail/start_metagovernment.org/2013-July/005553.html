<PRE>Hi Stephen,

These three forms of democracy can be distinguished:

    * Representative Democracy
    * Vote-Driven Direct Democracy
    * Discourse-Driven Direct Democracy

A cursory reading of the Ashland Food Co-op bylaws suggests that 
currently the co-op is organized as a fairly standard polyarchy. The 
membership votes on a few matters, the Board of Directors (BOD) acts as 
the representative assembly, and the General Manager (GM) acts as the 
chief executive. There is a little bit of vote-driven direct democracy 
going on, but the BOD, the GM, and the various hierarchs below the GM 
carry most of the weight of decision making. However (most thrillingly), 
within the BOD deliberations (according to the &quot;emergency vote&quot; clause), 
there is some discourse-driven decision making going on -- WooHoo!

The practices of the Votorola model are *vote-driven* direct democratic 
practices, which are intended to &quot;influence&quot; (not replace, not control) 
representative democracy forms (the BOD, the GM, etc.). The Votorola 
model (so far as I have seen) contains no discourse-driven direct 
democratic practices. (Various discourse practices are stuck on like 
post-it notes at various spots, but play no formal role in decision 
making.)


      IMPLEMENTING DISCOURSE-DRIVEN DIRECT DEMOCRACY

It would be possible for the co-op to set up a fully functional 
discourse-driven direct democracy system, tomorrow. It could be set up 
in a wiki (a networked set of wiki-pages). Wiki platforms are readily 
available, and the new system could run parallel with the existing 
systems, so that no initial changes to existing systems would be needed. 
&gt;<i>From that beginning, the new system could grow and evolve organically.
</I>
The elements of the new practice might be these: (unless someone objected)

    * Anyone can propose, anything.
    * Each initial proposal goes into a new wiki-page.
    * Notification is sent to everyone who has expressed interest.
    * Objections (including reasons, perhaps including recommendations)
      are proposed (either into the original page, and/or into new pages
      and then cross-linked).
    * The discourse (through successive, recursive proposing) continues
      until there are no unresolved objections to the initial proposal.
    * At that point, the initial proposal has &quot;passed&quot;, and is ready to
      be implemented.

In this system of decision making, it does not matter how many people 
are &quot;for&quot; the proposal, or how many people are &quot;against&quot; the proposal. 
It only matters that there are *no unresolved objections* standing 
&quot;against&quot; the proposal. That is the fundamental difference between 
&quot;vote-driven&quot; and &quot;discourse-driven&quot; decision making.

So, if you (Stephen) wished to get &quot;DDDD&quot; started within the co-op, you 
could propose doing so to the membership, as outlined above.
