<PRE>Hi Mike,

    Mike&gt; The distinction between primary guidance and authoritative
    decision is interesting, but only to a small number of people just
    now (yourself and Marc included). 

Ned&gt; Honestly, the distinction is not of much interest to me. From the 
perspective of full direct democracy, it is meaningless -- there is no 
&quot;other system&quot; to guide. The distinction only has meaning and 
significance from the perspective of hybrid systems such as polyarchy.

My standing proposal is that we put our efforts into creating a full 
direct democracy, and render all of the hybrid systems obsolete.
