</I>
This is your design choice, as I say.  Changing the last phrase to &quot;at
the moment the knowledge is acquired&quot; expresses the general case.
Generally a knowledge of the &quot;ought&quot; may be acquired without forcing
the &quot;is&quot;.  This allows for another design choice in which we try to
acquire that knowledge outside of any authoritative decision system.

Regardless of how it's acquired, the acquisition is what I term
primary guidance.  I infer that Blinap/Freetimea is a primary guidance
system (among other things) and I have no problem with that. ;^)

&gt;<i> The more we can work together, the more we can focus our efforts,
</I>&gt;<i> the more support we will be able to attract, and the more and faster
</I>&gt;<i> progress we will be able to make toward a better world.
</I>
Hopefully.  Please keep my original offer in mind.

The distinction between primary guidance and authoritative decision is
interesting, but only to a small number of people just now (yourself
and Marc included).  And it's probably well enough documented for now:

In any case, I've added this thread to the discussion back-links:

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would not be engaging in this exchange if I did not consider it to be 
</I>&gt;<i> worthwhile. (In fact, I feel that it has the potential to be extremely 
</I>&gt;<i> worthwhile -- to lead to some very good things.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I say that as a kind of warning: I am about to &quot;pick a nit&quot;, but only 
</I>&gt;<i> because I consider it to be a very important nit to pick. My view is 
</I>&gt;<i> that full direct democracy should be our goal, not &quot;guided&quot; polyarchy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; ... I would say that we don't need a separate primary guidance
</I>&gt;<i>     system. To have such a system would be unnecessary, expensive,
</I>&gt;<i>     wasteful, and distracting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; The need is to inform the deciders of what the decision ought
</I>&gt;<i>     to be. Do the deciders already have this knowledge on your &quot;planet&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     as you put it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; blah, blah, blah, ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; I think you're answering &quot;no&quot;. Some of your deciders have
</I>&gt;<i>     initial, personal opinions on what the decision ought to be, but
</I>&gt;<i>     none of them has actual knowledge. They'd first have to acquire that
</I>&gt;<i>     knowledge. This acquisition is what I call &quot;primary guidance&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I agree with you that &quot;no&quot; is the correct answer if &quot;no&quot; means this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Of course not, silly, the deciders cannot have knowledge of what the
</I>&gt;<i>     decision ought to be at the start. The knowledge of what the
</I>&gt;<i>     decision ought to be only comes into existence at the moment that
</I>&gt;<i>     the decision is made. Before deliberations have started, what the
</I>&gt;<i>     decision ought to be is unknowable; that knowledge does not exist yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, the question you appear to be &quot;really&quot; asking is this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     *Given* that the knowledge of what the decision ought to be *does*
</I>&gt;<i>     exist prior to the beginning of decider deliberations, have the
</I>&gt;<i>     deciders acquired or been given this knowledge prior to the
</I>&gt;<i>     beginning of their deliberations?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this is the question, then the appropriate answer is &quot;mu&quot;. In this 
</I>&gt;<i> case, the question is a &quot;Have you stopped beating your wife?&quot; question: 
</I>&gt;<i> giving either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; as an answer would ratify the *false* 
</I>&gt;<i> assumption/assertion that the knowledge of what the decision ought to be 
</I>&gt;<i> exists prior to the beginning of decider deliberations. In the system 
</I>&gt;<i> that I have been describing, that knowledge *cannot* be known at the 
</I>&gt;<i> start, because it only comes into existence at the end, at the point 
</I>&gt;<i> that the decision is made.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; Primary guidance is technically optional. It's quite possible
</I>&gt;<i>     to say what a decision *will* be, without ever knowing what it
</I>&gt;<i>     *ought* to be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Are you claiming that a discourse-driven direct democratic decision 
</I>&gt;<i> system is incapable of determining *both* what a decision ought to be 
</I>&gt;<i> *and* what the decision will be? If so, I would be very interested to 
</I>&gt;<i> read your arguments in support of that claim.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; But usually this is undesireable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Here you appear to be claiming that a two-system arrangement 
</I>&gt;<i> (primary guidance --&gt; authoritative deciding) is more desirable that a 
</I>&gt;<i> single-system arrangement such as the one that I have been describing. I 
</I>&gt;<i> would be very interested to read your arguments in support of this claim.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; Blinap may be attempting to address the deficiency by housing
</I>&gt;<i>     the production of both the guiding knowledge (what ought to be) and
</I>&gt;<i>     the fact of decisions (what will be) in a single system. This would
</I>&gt;<i>     be a design choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Yes! Blinap is (I claim) a much better design choice than Votorola 
</I>&gt;<i> through which to discover the knowledge of &quot;what ought to be&quot;, with the 
</I>&gt;<i> added benefit that Blinap can also, simultaneously, determine &quot;what will 
</I>&gt;<i> be&quot; better than any existing authoritative decision system (at the scale 
</I>&gt;<i> of populations, from the perspective of humanity, nature, and future 
</I>&gt;<i> generations). My contention is that Blinap is a much better design 
</I>&gt;<i> choice for public decision making than Votorola+Whatever.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; Another design choice is a specialized system that produces
</I>&gt;<i>     only the guiding knowledge. This is Votorola's design. As a
</I>&gt;<i>     consequence, Votorola is compatible with any and all decision
</I>&gt;<i>     systems that are based on formal choice (voting), including Blinap.
</I>&gt;<i>     This is one advantage of a specialized design, what is called
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;rationalization&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; From the perspective of public decision making through Blinap, 
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola (or any such specialized &quot;guidance-only&quot; system) is 
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary, expensive, wasteful, and distracting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To All:
</I>&gt;<i> We (the dedicated few, who are seeking to provide the world with better 
</I>&gt;<i> public decision systems) do not have a lot of resources. If we work 
</I>&gt;<i> together, we can do more good. If we work smart, we can do more good.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each of us is free to deploy her own personal resources however she sees 
</I>&gt;<i> fit. We can choose to scatter ourselves across myriad &quot;boutique&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> projects (as we mostly have been doing).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But we also have the option to do the bloody hard work of arriving 
</I>&gt;<i> together at &quot;what ought to be&quot; through discourse, before we start 
</I>&gt;<i> slinging code. (This is what Mike and I have been doing, and why I find 
</I>&gt;<i> it of value.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The more we can work together, the more we can focus our efforts, the 
</I>&gt;<i> more support we will be able to attract, and the more and faster 
</I>&gt;<i> progress we will be able to make toward a better world.
</I>&gt;<i>
