<PRE>Hi Oliver and Paul,  Thanks for the invitation.

Paul, I read a Google translation of your design notes here:
<A HREF="https://idee-2-0.piratenpad.de/multilectics">https://idee-2-0.piratenpad.de/multilectics</A>

Have you considered doing something similar with existing discussion
media?  I need something that attaches properties and link relations
to threads in order to reveal the &quot;larger&quot; discussion.  I'm thinking
it will be easier and less risky to use existing communities than to
create new communities (and a new discussion medium) from scratch.
We'll always have multiple discussion media and discussions that cut
across them, so it'll always be useful to interlink them.

Anyway, I'm doing a search for this facility.  I need it ASAP for
Votorola.  But I don't want to code it myself if I can avoid it.
