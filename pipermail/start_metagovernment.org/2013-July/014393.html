<PRE>Hi Mike,

    Ned&gt; ... I would say that we don't need a separate primary guidance
    system. To have such a system would be unnecessary, expensive,
    wasteful, and distracting.

    Mike&gt; The need is to inform the deciders of what the decision ought
    to be. Do the deciders already have this knowledge on your &quot;planet&quot;,
    as you put it?

I will now make another attempt to answer the question ... :-)

On my planet, when an initial proposal is proposed, the proposer is one 
of the deciders. As decider, I guess you could say that she probably 
&quot;already knows&quot; (that is, has an opinion about) what the decision ought 
to be.

Notification is sent, and those who receive the notification do not, in 
most cases, at the beginning &quot;already know&quot; (have an opinion about) what 
the decision ought to be -- they have to think about it, and study, in 
order to come to an opinion regarding what they think the decision ought 
to be.

As the ensuing discourse-through-proposing proceeds, individual deciders 
may change their opinions any number of times regarding what the 
decision ought to be. So, through this period I guess we could say that 
individual deciders may or may not &quot;already know&quot; what their opinion 
will wind up being by the time the decision happens.

The decision happens at the point that there are no unresolved valid 
objections to the implementation of some proposal (which may or may not 
be the initial proposal). Until that point, no one knows what will be, 
and each has her own opinion about what ought to be. When all of the 
&quot;ought to be&quot; opinions line up (through discourse), the decision 
happens, like the jackpot of a slot machine.

In a &quot;full&quot; direct democracy (which my planet has), there are not 
separate decision systems to deal with &quot;what ought to be&quot; and &quot;what will 
be&quot;. There is just the one decision system, that receives proposals from 
anybody and spits out what will be.

(I am trying my best to come up with a definitive &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, but it 
is just not happenin' ... Sorry! Your question contains implicit 
assumptions about &quot;how things must be&quot; that are not valid for the 
decision system that my planet uses.)
