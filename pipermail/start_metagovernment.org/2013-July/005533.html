<PRE>Hi Stephen,

&gt;<i> We would need to put together a proposal and then present it to the Board of
</I>&gt;<i> Directors. Our co-op is fairly progressive and I can imagine the BOD would
</I>&gt;<i> consider any reasonable proposal we put to them. Particularly if it made
</I>&gt;<i> their job easier (and perhaps more fun :-) ...and/or brought in an
</I>&gt;<i> increased level of democracy to our co-op. They meet the 2nd Wednesday of
</I>&gt;<i> every other month. The next board meeting is on the 14th of August. I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure how much lead time they would need in order to accept a new agenda
</I>&gt;<i> item. If folks are interested in putting something together, I could find
</I>&gt;<i> out. <A HREF="http://www.ashlandfood.coop/">http://www.ashlandfood.coop/</A>

This indeed looks very interesting. I pictured a production co-op could be 
also interesting, but your co-op could help us a lot already imo. Which of our 
practices do you think would be most useful for the coop:

If they are not covered, could you sketch a very rough outline of the 
process(es)/practice(s) you would appreciate most?
