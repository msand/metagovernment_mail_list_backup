<PRE>Hi Ned,

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ... I [Ned] would say that we don't need a separate primary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; guidance system.  To have such a system would be unnecessary,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; expensive, wasteful, and distracting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The need is to inform the deciders of what the decision ought to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be.  Do the deciders already have this knowledge on your &quot;planet&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as you put it?
</I>
I can't tell whether your answer is yes, or no.  I wasn't asking about
who the deciders are, but only about their knowledge.  Do they already
know what the decisions ought to be?

Mike

</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; The need is to inform the deciders of what the decision ought
</I>&gt;<i>     to be. Do the deciders already have this knowledge on your &quot;planet&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     as you put it? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; On my planet (the name of which is &quot;Freetimea&quot;, by the way) each 
</I>&gt;<i> and every sentient being is equally a decider (on equal footing).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each and every decider is free to participate in making any 
</I>&gt;<i> authoritative decision that is made.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no lower &quot;guidance-only&quot; class of individuals that are barred 
</I>&gt;<i> from directly participating in authoritative decision making.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Deciders are not agents, that need to be told by others what the 
</I>&gt;<i> decision ought to be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each decider becomes informed concerning what the decision ought to be 
</I>&gt;<i> through whatever means the decider chooses. Each decider decides 
</I>&gt;<i> autonomously what the decision ought to be, and then presses for that 
</I>&gt;<i> decision through the discourse that determines the decision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any guidance among deciders occurs informally. (&quot;Mortimer! You moron! 
</I>&gt;<i> Stop saying things that make me feel embarrassed to be seen with you in 
</I>&gt;<i> public!&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this provide enough information to enable you to answer further? 
</I>&gt;<i> (If not, please give me some guidance regarding what else you need ...)
