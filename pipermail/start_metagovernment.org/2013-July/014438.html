<PRE>Hi Stephen,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; Would there be any reason not to combine (any of) these
    into the same pool?

Ned&gt; I would suggest that the three pools be kept separate. The work of 
the three is wildly different, and eventually we will want to maintain 
&quot;track records&quot; of that work, to provide basis for considering past 
performance in automatically assigning new work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; I'm thinking (some) people would volunteer for the
    positions mentioned above....at least initially.

Ned&gt; To the extent that people are willing to &quot;work for free&quot;, *of 
course* the co-op should take advantage of that ... :^)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; Which brings up the question as to whether proposals would
    need to be re-appraised at some point before they were put to a
    *call for objections*.

Ned&gt; My suggestion would be that each proposal be treated as an 
unmodifiable unit at the point that it is submitted, which would mean 
that it would never need to be re-appraised. If we let proposals be 
&quot;moving targets&quot; that can change, we introduce unnecessary logistical 
and conceptual problems, as you suggest.

After the original proposal has been submitted, anyone can then 
subsequently copy the original proposal to use as the base for creating 
a new proposal by modifying the original. We can have our cake and eat it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; Also, what would the requisite disconnect/disclosure be
    between *appraisers, distributors, and investigators* and the
    *proposers*? Ashland is a small town and it's very likely that one
    could know the other.

I would suggest not worrying at all about that sort of thing in the 
beginning. At the point that someone spotted an actual occurrence of a 
problem (&quot;Hey, wait a minute ...&quot;), the person could propose that the 
problem existed and had actually occurred, and that would then be the 
&quot;natural&quot; time to invite proposed solutions to forestall future 
occurrences of the problem. As long as all distribution selections, 
proposals, appraisals, and investigation findings are always published 
at some timely point, there is not a lot of room for mischief in a group 
small enough to be a community. The corruption problems arise more in 
large populations, with high volumes of proposals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have gone ahead and incorporated your remarks into a new draft of the 
proposal ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      POOL OF APPRAISERS

Any member can register to be put into the pool of available appraisers. 
The individual can register as a general appraiser, or can specify 
particular categories of interest (proposals involving watersheds, 
proposals involving homeless, etc.)

TRAINING: Documentation and self-training materials for appraising will 
be available on-line. (Eventually, documentation and training will be 
incorporated into the on-line appraisal process itself.)

Also, each appraisal is itself a proposal, and can be challenged through 
proposing -- which means that &quot;training&quot; can be administered by anyone 
who sees a problem, at any time: the individual can propose that the 
problem exists, and propose solutions and such.


      POOL OF INVESTIGATORS

Any member can register to be put into the pool of available 
investigators. Again, the individual can register as a general 
investigator, or can specify particular categories of interest.

TRAINING: Because the nature of investigation is &quot;free-form&quot;, 
apprenticeship may be the best means of training. A newby investigator 
learns by working with one or more experienced investigators. In 
addition, case studies (and all past investigation proposals) will be 
available on-line to study.


      POOL OF DISTRIBUTORS

Any member can register to be put into the pool of available distributors.

TRAINING: Each kind of chore is clearly documented, and algorithmic. 
(All distributor chores will eventually be performed by software.)

SCHEDULING: One way to schedule distributors might be to have 
&quot;distributing for a day&quot; be a project. Distributors in the pool would 
then fill the calendar by putting themselves onto open days, so that 
each day had an associated distributor. (On busy days, the scheduled 
distributor could call in other distributors to share the work as needed.)

DISTRIBUTOR CHORES:

    * Receive new proposals.
    * For each proposal: select appraisers, select investigator.
    * Distribute the proposal to appraisers.
    * Receive appraisals, forward to selected investigator.
    * Receive investigator proposal, process if necessary.
    * Act on the appraisals: either pass the appraised proposal to the
      &quot;invite objections&quot; phase, or &quot;fail&quot; the proposal and send it back
      to the proposer.


      PROPOSER APPRAISES

When a new proposal is submitted, it is appraised (tagged, categorized, 
judged) by the proposer (as part of the submission process). (&quot;Judged&quot; 
means judging whether the proposal fits the proposal criteria and such. 
Anyone can propose new judgment elements to be included in the appraisal 
process.)


      PROPOSAL DISTRIBUTION

The proposer then submits the proposal and appraisal to the &quot;distributor 
of the day&quot;, and the distributor then uses the proposer's categorization 
to select the appraisers and the investigator, and then distributes the 
proposal to the appraisers, and publishes the proposal for all to see.


      INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL

Upon receiving a new proposal, each appraiser can choose to 
independently appraise it (or not). (In the beginning, we don't really 
care that there is no monitoring or enforcement to ensure that the 
appraisals are independent -- dangers of corruption are negligible.)


      APPRAISALS COMPARED

All appraisals that are received are then compared. The investigator 
selected by the initial distributor does the comparisons manually, and 
then investigates any discrepancies among the appraisals. (Eventually, 
this comparison will be done automatically, by software.)

The investigation (if there is one) culminates with the investigator 
making a proposal of findings and recommendations. (These proposals are 
primary drivers of the evolution of the decision system.)

The investigation process is the alternative to having a training 
process. Everybody is continually learning together, &quot;on the job&quot;, as 
things move along.


      APPRAISERS AND INVESTIGATORS ARE PAID

Instead of paying salaries and such to vested positions, appraising and 
investigating are project work, with payment for service rendered.

How much would be paid would be determined through successfully proposing.


      PROPOSERS MAY RECEIVE PRIZES

Specifically in the case of the co-op, the prizes might be party hats or 
brownie points. The co-op is non-profit, so profit could not be used as 
a basis for prizing. However, there might be other measures, such as 
cost-reduction, that could occasionally be used as basis for monetary 
prizing.
