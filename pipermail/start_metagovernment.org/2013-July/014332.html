<PRE>I haven't had time to review this whole Ashland Co-op thread yet, but I'll interject in the part that mentions my idea:

&gt;<i> I would suggest that Ed has just given us a much more appropriate target for all that development. If it takes him three months to create the first 501c3 foundation for us to direct, that means that we have three months to have operational a collaborative governance system capable of directing it. The aim would then be to evolve that initial community-scale system into a global-scale system capable of directing any number of national foundations, anywhere.
</I>
It looks like it may be more than 3 months. The US Internal Revenue Service (the agency which approves 50c3 applications) has a 1+ year backlog in reviewing applications:
<A HREF="http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Where-Is-My-Exemption-Application">http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Where-Is-My-Exemption-Application</A>
&quot;Currently, we are assigning applications received in April 2012.&quot;

I will try to move quickly to get the application submitted (there is a nonprofit which assists in this process, for a moderately large fee, and I will probably pay for their help). But it looks like while I can get the company formed this year, it won't be eligible for funding from foundations until late next year. Hopefully.

In any event, once I start ramping up, I will probably be asking this group to help form the bylaws. It gets tricky. It looks like the IRS demands that a nonprofit company have a board of directors. And I would really like to avoid that, because I want the nonprofit company to be a model for other nonprofits to adopt collaborative governance. But we might have to compromise in order to get the application approved, and just push against the boundaries of what the US tax code will permit as opportunity allows. I am probably going to pay that same group some additional fees for consulting on the best approach to this. More to come (fairly) soon.

Hopefully the Metagovernment nonprofit organization will help in several ways. First, when/if it eventually does have money, it will be a catalyst for participation of other e-dem groups because it will be offering that money to their projects, based on decisions made by the collaborative governance of this group. That will be a real test for us (it's all well and good to make ideological decisions, but when money's on the line, things get a lot more heated... I look forward to that challenge!). But it will also hopefully be a unifying force, without imposing any particular ideology. 

Second, as I noted in my proposal, a core mission of the company would be to promote the sort of cooperative-competition projects like crossforum. We don't have to decide which vision is correct: we just let the marketplace of users decide. All we have to do is provide that marketplace a place to thrive.
