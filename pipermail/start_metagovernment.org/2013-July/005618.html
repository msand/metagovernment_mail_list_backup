<PRE>Hi Stephen, (Awesome Proposal!)

    Stephen&gt; *Appraisers* would be elected and trained by the Community
    Network.

Considerations:

    * In the beginning, there are no trainers.
    * Training is costly overhead.
    * Training concentrates power (&quot;gatekeeping&quot;).
    * &quot;Why would anyone want to work as an appraiser?&quot;
    * Elections are costly, and involve naked voting.
    * Elections concentrate power (&quot;vesting&quot;).

Here is my counter-proposal.


      POOL OF APPRAISERS

Any member can register to be put into the pool of available appraisers. 
The individual can register as a general appraiser, or can specify 
particular categories of interest (proposals involving watersheds, 
proposals involving homeless, etc.)


      POOL OF INVESTIGATORS

Any member can register to be put into the pool of available 
investigators. Again, the individual can register as a general 
investigator, or can specify particular categories of interest.


      PROPOSER APPRAISES

When a new proposal is received, it is appraised (tagged, categorized, 
judged) by the proposer (as part of the submission process).


      PROPOSAL DISTRIBUTION

The proposal is then distributed (by a set of individuals pretending to 
be a software distribution program) to appraisers in the pool, using the 
proposer's categorization.


      INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL

Upon receiving a new proposal, each appraiser can choose to 
independently appraise it (or not). (In the beginning, we don't really 
care that there is no monitoring or enforcement to ensure that the 
appraisals are independent -- dangers of corruption are negligible.)


      APPRAISALS COMPARED

All appraisals that are received are then compared. Eventually, this 
comparison would be done automatically, by software. But in the 
beginning, an investigator would be selected from the pool of 
investigators (by a set of individuals pretending to be a software 
selection program) to do the comparisons manually, and then investigate 
any discrepancies among the appraisals.

The investigation (if there is one) culminates with the investigator 
making a proposal of findings and recommendations. (These proposals are 
primary drivers of the evolution of the decision system.)

The investigation process is the alternative to having a training 
process. Everybody is continually learning together, &quot;on the job&quot;, as 
things move along.


      APPRAISERS AND INVESTIGATORS ARE PAID

Instead of paying salaries and such to vested positions, appraising and 
investigating are project work, with payment for service rendered.

How much would be paid would be determined through 
discourse-through-proposing.


      PROPOSERS MAY RECEIVE PRIZES

Specifically in the case of the co-op, the prizes might be party hats or 
brownie points. The co-op is non-profit, so profit could not be used as 
a basis for prizing. However, there might be other measures, such as 
cost-reduction, that could be used as basis for monetary prizing.
