<PRE>Hi Ned,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stephen, obviously to all you are the sort of user/visionary that e-dem
</I>&gt;<i> designers and developers dream of working with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Conseo, Stephen has just given you feedback, with which I heartily
</I>&gt;<i> concur: the Votorola main page to which you linked is mostly
</I>&gt;<i> incomprehensible. It cannot be used as part of a proposal to the Ashland
</I>&gt;<i> Food Co-op. (Maybe you could write up &quot;elevator pitches&quot; for one or more
</I>&gt;<i> of the practices?)
</I>
The practices are currently not unified. I am not the main developer of 
Votorola, Mike is, and so I only speak for myself here.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Conseo, how close is your team to putting up a fully functional practice
</I>&gt;<i> (any practice), that Stephen (and the rest of us) could actually engage
</I>&gt;<i> in? The actual experience of engaging in the practice might then enable
</I>&gt;<i> him to write up a proposal of the practice that would be comprehensible
</I>&gt;<i> and persuasive to his audience.
</I>
Mike tries to implement a practice (1), but I would see more value in learning 
about the coop and about their practice for now. I think it is a better 
baseline empirically, but we will see... it mostly depends on the Coops 
interest and commitment now imo.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stephen, in order to enable Conseo to &quot;diagnose&quot; which of his practices
</I>&gt;<i> might be useful to the co-op, it would be helpful if you could present
</I>&gt;<i> an analysis of existing democratic practices within the co-op. Here is a
</I>&gt;<i> start:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     * The 8000 members vote on bylaws.
</I>&gt;<i>     * The 8000 members elect board members.
</I>&gt;<i>     * The 8000 members choose the grants committee members?
</I>&gt;<i>     * The General Manager is hired by the BOD?
</I>&gt;<i>     * The Board of Directors decide ...
</I>&gt;<i>     * The General Manager decides ...
</I>&gt;<i>     * The Grants Committee decides ...
</I>&gt;<i>     * ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This indeed is interesting, but only a first quantitive superficial fact-
sheet. What I am interested in is rather where the Coop-base, the normal 
members and especially the people doing the real work (and wealth creation) in 
initiatives or leading business see the most potential to draw in public 
support or extended cooperation. I would try to help them with this specific 
task, if I see that they care about the issue. Mike is not convinced yet, but 
what he outlines makes up some good requirements for issues to bootstrap 
(software)-practices upon:

&quot;(a) the discussion has to be long-lived, or easy to re-start on demand
(b) it has to serve some practical end, there has to be an output, a product, 
something
(c) it has to depend on people reaching agreement
(d) online&quot; (Mike, private conversation)

We have made some bad experiences with short-lived and vague issues before, 
concretely with Occupy, but I think this was also a misunderstanding of what 
they are/were about politically and how they worked (mostly offline and 
rapidly changing discussion + ad-hoc action). Also their discussions were 
framed by their umbrella nature (99% vs. 1%), which does not allow to get 
self-made success through consent.

I would then again emphasize said points about the coops committment and 
interest in the particular issue (they can chose it). It is necessary that 
somebody bridges communication and helps us on the ground. From my side, I 
would offer to help build the software needed (open to their proposals), if 
there is interest. But to get the necessary environment to build the software 
we need some committed users/helpers and a problem-solution perspective. So I 
hope we can learn more about the coop soon :-D

Regarding the proposed practice question, I think most practices here at the 
moment are speculative technological concepts to help real consensus building. 
I think what we all lack a bit with our outlines and elevator pitches is a 
concrete example. I would like to focus on making that happen and then discuss 
strategies and our practices as solutions when the problem happens in the real 
world, so we can try out and learn more by doing it. We also have already put 
some thoughts into explorative and open architecture with the open-voting-
network and p2p, so all these things can be applied on the way. There will 
also be plenty of room to broaden the horizon and help reframe practices if we 
can discuss their limitations concretely (but we might be disappointed by the 
triviality of the process at first).
