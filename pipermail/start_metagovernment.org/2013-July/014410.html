<PRE>Hi Steve and list,

Forgot to append the link to user profiles as Wiki pages for (1):
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom">http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom</A>
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Conseo-Polyc0l0rNet">http://zelea.com/w/User:Conseo-Polyc0l0rNet</A>
See here how to edit such a page: 
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Conseo-Polyc0l0rNet&amp;action=edit">http://zelea.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Conseo-Polyc0l0rNet&amp;action=edit</A>

Semantic properties on these pages are machine readable and can be user 
defined. Do you think it was possible to use this wiki editing?
I think having a schema-free public editable configuration registry like this 
is pretty powerful, but I am not sure if people can handle the Wiki, this most 
likely is the most important training part technically with the current setup.

conseo

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This *proposal* is intended to gather approval and support for organizing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; web-based *Community Network* within the membership of the Ashland Food
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Co-op (AFC) located in Ashland, Oregon, USA.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The purpose of this Community Network is to encourage any and all AFC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; member(s) to develop *proposals* that are oriented toward building and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sustaining a vibrant local community, and then to submit their proposals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Co-op membership for collaboration, funding, and support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, this is pretty generic and clear so far.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All proposals submitted to this Community Network would need to fit within
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certain (TBD) *categories and criteria*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why? If you try to assess risks or problems of certain proposals, then
</I>&gt;<i> better pin them down first and let us tackle them one by one and only wire
</I>&gt;<i> them with the system together in the end. I will recur on this in the
</I>&gt;<i> following paragraphs. Maybe you can try to boil it down a bit more? But I
</I>&gt;<i> like where it is going.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These (TBD) proposal *categories* could include items such as: local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organic farming and gardening; stewarding the watershed/bioregion;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community health and well-being; caring for the homeless; sustainable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; energy and transport; community networking; local currency; green
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; building; etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and basically whatever the community (beyond the coop) can come up
</I>&gt;<i> with. Raising a proposal should be as generic and simple as possible to
</I>&gt;<i> generate the necessary reach to become attractive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These (TBD) proposal *criteria* could include items such as: must follow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the precautionary principle, must be open and transparent, must be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community based and focussed, must have a clear outline for development,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; must have an explicit budget for any funds requested, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why? Adding constraints doesn't make it easier but potentially more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated. There might be good reasons, yet I don't see them yet.
</I>&gt;<i> Non-sense or evil proposals should be covered by the process itself (people
</I>&gt;<i> arguing). Maybe you can illustrate the problem from the perspective of a
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholder in form of a story-card/scenario for me to better understand
</I>&gt;<i> which problems we are hedging against.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Proposals would go through a process of *appraisal* to see if they fit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these *criteria and category* constraints. If and when they pass
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appraisal they would be *tagged* and posted online.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *Appraisers* would be elected and trained by the Community Network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You mean the audience/users of the tool? I agree. But ideally training
</I>&gt;<i> should be little and done as needed (and it will be, I just wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> formalize it yet though). The process will need work constantly to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> this administrative burden (this is imo the main goal of the tool, to make
</I>&gt;<i> it feasable for all users).
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't formalize roles (yet), in the beginning we just need people who
</I>&gt;<i> help wherever it is necessary and share the consensual intention.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A *tag* would list all relevant data of a given proposal (e.g. - it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; category, date of submission, budget request, location, timing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; associations, etc.) and link it to the member or members presenting the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally the proposal contains that information or links to it, yes. You can
</I>&gt;<i> call that tags, but I would just keep links and infoboxes from the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki/interfaces to all information necessary (user-drafted ontologies for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;tagging&quot; are a wiki feature and in Votorola via Semantic-Mediawiki). We can
</I>&gt;<i> pull in outside information as well, but for the start we can hand-copy it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If a proposal doesn't pass appraisal it would still be tagged and posted,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but would not have access to the Networks tools and assistance for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; collaborative development and/or funding, until it was able to pass
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appraisal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is appraisal something the coop does? Who decides? For me the only
</I>&gt;<i> constraint is that *all* &quot;voters&quot; have to agree for some period before a
</I>&gt;<i> plan can be implemented. They can consensually decide to lower the barrier
</I>&gt;<i> (2/3, 50%, meeting the resource needs, etc.) for some part of the execution
</I>&gt;<i> though. The coop members can decide as well as every other user or entity
</I>&gt;<i> to support certain efforts or vote against them (veto it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any and all AFC members would be free to join the Community Network in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; order to: present their own individual proposal(s); track, collaborate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in, and fund the development of proposals submitted by other members of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Network; and to network, interact, and associate with other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individuals within the membership of the AFC Community Network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Everybody should have the possibility to join the platform, in fact it
</I>&gt;<i> should be an attractor for coop membership, not an exclusive
</I>&gt;<i> (discriminatory) electorate. Or is there a risk involved here?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any AFC member would be free to make pledges of support (financial and/or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in kind) to any proposal that has passed the appraisal criteria and been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; posted online. Their pledges would become due upon membership consensus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again any user of the platform should have these freedoms and be able to
</I>&gt;<i> propose anything. Dead proposals could be (re)moved though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Membership consensus would be attained if there are no *reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objections* to the proposal one week following notification of a call for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A week is a bit short, imagine you are on vacation. I would make it a month
</I>&gt;<i> and, yes, consensus is the default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Determining which objections are *unreasonable* would be the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; responsibility
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of an elected body of the membership.....(perhaps the appraisers).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are legal restrictions and the coop in its role as administrator and
</I>&gt;<i> host of the platform can put constraints ofc. These should be made clear
</I>&gt;<i> indeed, e.g. binding to follow US legislation.
</I>&gt;<i> I would just say that the host of the platform can stop any proposal and
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, which is obvious, but as the software and data is
</I>&gt;<i> open-source, people can implement the proposal on their own platform. The
</I>&gt;<i> point is imo that the consensus-building process itself should filter
</I>&gt;<i> problematic issues and the technology should transcend lockins. It is
</I>&gt;<i> enough for any user to publicly vote against a proposal to veto it.
</I>&gt;<i> Here one can demand that they have to be a citizen of Ashland to start with,
</I>&gt;<i> for instance. But any such rule is already discriminating, as all issues
</I>&gt;<i> can be implicitly global.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A Foundation would be set up to facilitate the funding transaction of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals and to bestow any grants available to certain categories of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, sounds reasonable. It should probably be separate from the
</I>&gt;<i> administrative body of the platform (technical staff) though, to build it
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;neutral&quot; grounds to reach out to other foundations and institutions
</I>&gt;<i> with the platform. But as long as it is open-source, this decision can be
</I>&gt;<i> adjusted at any later time, so we don't have to decide anything here yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Those proposals attaining the consensus of the membership would become
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available for support and funding from the Foundation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All proposals can be funded and gain support from any of the voters, but
</I>&gt;<i> they have to reach consensus by *all* public voters to become executable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Ashland Food Co-op (and others) could offer grants to those proposals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it felt best fit certain grant criteria. (e.g. - the greatest good for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the greatest number.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but again, they can do that in the process on a day to day basis after
</I>&gt;<i> the fact.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Grant recipients would be selected by the membership at large through a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process of voting at the end of each cycle. A grant cycle would last for 6
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; months. Those proposals voted to receive grants would not need to wait for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the end of the cycle in order to acquire any pledged funding/resources due
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to them upon reaching the consensus of the Network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand that grand cycle, but this should be completely free to
</I>&gt;<i> decide for the coop, I guess. It is then not coupled to the process and not
</I>&gt;<i> important how they decide that (e.g. how they set deadlines in their
</I>&gt;<i> proposal version for their funding).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any member who wanted to participate in the Community Network would need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; develop an individual web page. The requisite minimum data for this page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be the members name and Co-op number. The Co-op number would be kept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; private if requested by the member, but would be used internally to verify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Co-op membership, and to tag certain aspects of a members interaction,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; association, and participation within the Network for record keeping in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Database.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a user profile(?) (1) I don't understand what the id-number is for,
</I>&gt;<i> but this can be documented for coop members on their Wikipage/profile for
</I>&gt;<i> instance. Verified E-Mail is enough and you can map identities through
</I>&gt;<i> verified mail addresses alone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These individual webpages would be hosted by an *AFC Community Network
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; website*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, probably best separate from the actual web-presentation of the coop,
</I>&gt;<i> but possibly on the same network or for now wherever the site works best
</I>&gt;<i> (again as open-source + open-data it can be migrated and forked at any
</I>&gt;<i> time).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The AFC Community Network website would make it simple and easy for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individuals to present, search/locate, track, collaborate with, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support/fund those proposals a member found interesting and worthwhile.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; website would also make it easy to connect with the Network community in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; order to share ones interest in, research data on, position towards, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relationship to, any proposal currently active in the Community Network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, except it should be open to anybody imo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Community Network would establish a Database to track all relevant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aspects of proposals up to the time of funding.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am lost again here. The platform has already a database, but (almost) all
</I>&gt;<i> data (no passwords, IP addresses, ...) is public, so anybody can track
</I>&gt;<i> anything they are interested in, put it in databases, print it out or
</I>&gt;<i> project it on displays.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Database would collect and make available data regarding those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals any member was involved in presenting, developing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; collaborating on, liking, or funding.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I would name it a Wiki, because that is pretty much a publicly editable
</I>&gt;<i> database and people know that better imo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any element of this process/structure could be changed at any time by a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3/4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; majority vote of active users of the Network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why suddenly 3/4? This would allow discrimination through the backdoor,
</I>&gt;<i> although one can do so if the risk is clearly specified as is with the
</I>&gt;<i> emergency BOD rule.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An active user of the Community Network is a member who has set up their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individual/personal web page and participated in the development of at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; least one proposal in the year preceding the proposal for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process/structure change. This active user participation requirement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; begins
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one year following the institution of the Community Network. Until one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; year
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; passes, any member who has *joined* the Network may vote on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process/structure proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am lost again here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the Community Network website the membership would be able to interact
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with AFC staff through an online bulletin board linked to the website
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; posts comments, questions, and suggestions from members.....and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answers/feedback from staff.  The staff could publish their newsletter and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reports online as well. The BOD could post meeting dates and notes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regarding the issues on their agenda.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would just create a separate discussion forum for the coop, it is no big
</I>&gt;<i> deal and a public communication channel for the specific institution of the
</I>&gt;<i> coop. Ideally it would be open to the public as well and had a certain
</I>&gt;<i> discussion space for the voting platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This proposal will be submitted to the AFC Board of Directors (BOD)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following the consensus of those collaborating on the development of this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This proposal will be submitted to the AFC membership at large following
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the consensus of the AFC BOD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The AFC Community Network would be the Beta test for an *City of Ashland*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Online Community Network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, we can do that. If this was your intent by locking it down on coop
</I>&gt;<i> members, I would like to hear your reasoning behind it. I don't think the
</I>&gt;<i> platform will be unmanageable if it is open to all Ashland citizens from the
</I>&gt;<i> start, but I might be wrong. It needs a long beta phase though and some
</I>&gt;<i> committed users/activists. This is most crucial imo, to get &quot;makers&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> users who share this vision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This proposed *Community Network* is intended to be a model that can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; duplicated and scaled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, in fact this is metagov's interest, I'd say, here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyone is welcome to comment on and/or participate in the development of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, permanently. In fact at some point it should be a plan on the platform
</I>&gt;<i> itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
