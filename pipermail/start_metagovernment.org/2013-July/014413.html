Hi Conseo,
Very good questions. I really appreciate your taking the time to respond. I answered most of your questions. Some questions seemed similar to others, so I passed on them. If I missed anything please ask again.

&gt;&gt;<i> These (TBD) proposal *criteria* could include items such as: must follow the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> precautionary principle, must be open and transparent, must be community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based and focussed, must have a clear outline for development, must have an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explicit budget for any funds requested, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Why? Adding constraints doesn't make it easier but potentially more 
</I>&gt;<i> complicated. There might be good reasons, yet I don't see them yet. Non-sense 
</I>&gt;<i> or evil proposals should be covered by the process itself (people arguing). 
</I>
Yes. We could let the process *weed out* those proposals that don't line up with the *interests* of the community. That would simplify things substantially. Though, I think there should still be at least be some *suggested criteria* for those making proposals, and for those doing the weeding out of those proposals that don't 'line up'. This would perhaps simplify the process even more by eliminating a lot of arguing down the road in determining whether some &quot;non-sense or evil proposal&quot; should be supported...or not.

&gt;&gt;<i> *Appraisers* would be elected and trained by the Community Network.
</I>&gt;<i> You mean the audience/users of the tool? I agree. But ideally training should 
</I>&gt;<i> be little and done as needed (and it will be, I just wouldn't formalize it yet 
</I>&gt;<i> though). The process will need work constantly to reduce this administrative 
</I>&gt;<i> burden (this is imo the main goal of the tool, to make it feasable for all 
</I>&gt;<i> users).
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't formalize roles (yet), in the beginning we just need people who 
</I>&gt;<i> help wherever it is necessary and share the consensual intention.
</I>
So, at least initially, the proposers and audience/users would appraise the proposals (for) themselves within the process of &quot;arguing&quot;?   

&gt;&gt;<i> A *tag* would list all relevant data of a given proposal....
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally the proposal contains that information or links to it, yes. You can 
</I>&gt;<i> call that tags, but I would just keep links and infoboxes from the 
</I>&gt;<i> wiki/interfaces to all information necessary (user-drafted ontologies for 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;tagging&quot; are a wiki feature and in Votorola via Semantic-Mediawiki). We can 
</I>&gt;<i> pull in outside information as well, but for the start we can hand-copy it.
</I>

This is where I begin to get a little lost. Though I trust your thinking here. We can work out the details later on.

&gt;&gt;<i> Any and all AFC members would be free to join the Community Network in order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to: present their own individual proposal(s); track, collaborate in, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fund the development of proposals submitted by other members of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Network; and to network, interact, and associate with other individuals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within the membership of the AFC Community Network.
</I>&gt;<i> Everybody should have the possibility to join the platform, in fact it should 
</I>&gt;<i> be an attractor for coop membership, not an exclusive (discriminatory)  
</I>&gt;<i> electorate. Or is there a risk involved here?
</I>
I think we need to draw a line somewhere. Including the larger community of Ashland in the beginning might be bit much. But yes, anyone who isn't already a Co-op member could simply join (the Co-op) if they wanted to be involved in the process. And then, once it's up and running, that *criteria* could be dropped or extended to the next scale. This is a little tricky because we don't want to discriminate...and we want to contain it so that we don't have a multitude of proposers/users/on-lookers overwhelming the system.

&gt;&gt;<i> Any AFC member would be free to make pledges of support (financial and/or in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind) to any proposal that has passed the appraisal criteria and been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posted online. Their pledges would become due upon membership consensus of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> Again any user of the platform should have these freedoms and be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> propose anything. Dead proposals could be (re)moved though.
</I>
Here again, start small for the beta. Then gradually scale up. And yes, &quot;dead proposals could be (re)moved&quot;....perhaps at the end of each cycle those proposals without any active development taking place (need descriptors here) would be tossed.

&gt;&gt;<i> Membership consensus would be attained if there are no *reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objections* to the proposal one week following notification of a call for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objections.
</I>&gt;<i> A week is a bit short, imagine you are on vacation. I would make it a month 
</I>&gt;<i> and, yes, consensus is the default.
</I>
A month seems a bit long to me. Most people stay *connected* wherever they are/go. And if they can't follow along for some reason they could possibly set up a proxy. I'm not attached to one week, but I'm concerned that if a proposal is in the wings for a month, (waiting for someone to get back from vacation), it might lose it's momentum.

&gt;&gt;<i> Determining which objections are *unreasonable* would be the responsibility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of an elected body of the membership.....(perhaps the appraisers).
</I>&gt;<i> There are legal restrictions and the coop in its role as administrator and 
</I>&gt;<i> host of the platform can put constraints ofc. These should be made clear 
</I>&gt;<i> indeed, e.g. binding to follow US legislation. 
</I>&gt;<i> I would just say that the host of the platform can stop any proposal and 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, which is obvious, but as the software and data is open-source, 
</I>&gt;<i> people can implement the proposal on their own platform. The point is imo that 
</I>&gt;<i> the consensus-building process itself should filter problematic issues and the 
</I>&gt;<i> technology should transcend lockins. It is enough for any user to publicly 
</I>&gt;<i> vote against a proposal to veto it. 
</I>&gt;<i> Here one can demand that they have to be a citizen of Ashland to start with, 
</I>&gt;<i> for instance. But any such rule is already discriminating, as all issues can 
</I>&gt;<i> be implicitly global.
</I>
I think you misunderstood my position. I'm referring to the ability of the Network to determine whether an *objection* (that Is holding up consensus on a proposal) is *reasonable*...or not. 

Let's say:
Mary proposes to have a separate homeless shelter for women and children because of some past safety issues resulting from combining men and women in that kind of situation.

Everyone agrees except John, who (deep inside) feels threatened and abandoned by women and doesn't want to give them any special treatment. He argues that having a *combined* shelter would instead give men and women an opportunity to *work things out*...together. He feels very strongly about this and isn't open to any gender separation...and therefore blocks consensus.

I realize this is a bit imaginative...but, in the type of process we are developing, there are likely to be situations where one individual is blocking consensus because of some personal wounding (or vested interest), and the community is held hostage because of someone's individual process or selfish interest. 

The question for me is: who decides whether an objection is *reasonable* or not? 

In my mind there are risks going both ways. On the one hand, having a *panel of elected arbiters/judges* risks introducing an element of elitism. On the other hand, to introduce a *subjective* constraint, i.e. &quot;a proposal passes if there are no *reasonable* objections&quot;...without some way of determining which objections are *reasonable*, runs the risk of sabotaging the process....with no way of preventing endless argument about which objection is reasonable and which is not. A determination will need to be made somewhere...somehow.  Or we just drop *reasonable* and open it up to 'objection' on any grounds whatsoever.

&gt;&gt;<i> The Ashland Food Co-op (and others) could offer grants to those proposals it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> felt best fit certain grant criteria. (e.g. - the greatest good for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> greatest number.)
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but again, they can do that in the process on a day to day basis after 
</I>&gt;<i> the fact.
</I>
I think having a grant program as an integral element of the process would be a big attractor towards drawing in proposals...and participation in the process of developing them.

&gt;&gt;<i> Grant recipients would be selected by the membership at large through a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process of voting at the end of each cycle. A grant cycle would last for 6
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> months. Those proposals voted to receive grants would not need to wait for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the end of the cycle in order to acquire any pledged funding/resources due
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to them upon reaching the consensus of the Network.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand that grant cycle, but this should be completely free to 
</I>&gt;<i> decide for the coop, I guess. It is then not coupled to the process and not 
</I>&gt;<i> important how they decide that (e.g. how they set deadlines in their proposal 
</I>&gt;<i> version for their funding).
</I>
Remember, with respect to Co-op membership, *they* is *we*.

&gt;&gt;<i> The Community Network would establish a Database to track all relevant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aspects of proposals up to the time of funding.
</I>&gt;<i> I am lost again here. The platform has already a database, but (almost) all 
</I>&gt;<i> data (no passwords, IP addresses, ...) is public, so anybody can track 
</I>&gt;<i> anything they are interested in, put it in databases, print it out or project 
</I>&gt;<i> it on displays.
</I>
Ok...I don't understand the tech side of things very well. The main thing is to have all relevant info easily available to everyone.

&gt;&gt;<i> Any element of this process/structure could be changed at any time by a 3/4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> majority vote of active users of the Network.
</I>&gt;<i> Why suddenly 3/4? This would allow discrimination through the backdoor, 
</I>&gt;<i> although one can do so if the risk is clearly specified as is with the 
</I>&gt;<i> emergency BOD rule.
</I>
My thinking here is to make the *self-organinzing* element more fluid by lowering the threshold necessary for evolving the process. Some people simply resist change on grounds that aren't very reasonable (in my mind). Again, there are risks going both ways. I'm suggesting using 3/4 majority because I can imagine some people disagreeing to any change just because they're comfortable with the status quo. My fear is that the process would stagnate and not evolve if consensus was requisite for any process change. I guess I feel there are times when the majority holds enough wisdom to be trusted. And, at least initially, there will be a lot of bugs to work out. Requiring a consensus for process changes could really slow things down, IMO.  And finally, I can easily imagine a 3/4 majority agreeing to making consensus requisite for a process change...if things were moving/changing to quickly or unwisely.

&gt;&gt;<i> An active user of the Community Network is a member who has set up their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual/personal web page and participated in the development of at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least one proposal in the year preceding the proposal for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process/structure change. This active user participation requirement begins
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one year following the institution of the Community Network. Until one year
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passes, any member who has *joined* the Network may vote on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process/structure proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> I am lost again here.
</I>
I think there needs to be some limitation/constraints set in order to contain potential overwhelm in the initial development phase(s) of the process. What would that look like to you?

&gt;&gt;<i> On the Community Network website the membership would be able to interact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with AFC staff through an online bulletin board linked to the website which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posts comments, questions, and suggestions from members.....and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answers/feedback from staff.  The staff could publish their newsletter and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reports online as well. The BOD could post meeting dates and notes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regarding the issues on their agenda.
</I>&gt;<i> I would just create a separate discussion forum for the coop, it is no big 
</I>&gt;<i> deal and a public communication channel for the specific institution of the 
</I>&gt;<i> coop. Ideally it would be open to the public as well and had a certain 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion space for the voting platform.
</I>
Yes. 

&gt;&gt;<i> The AFC Community Network would be the Beta test for an *City of Ashland*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Online Community Network.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, we can do that. If this was your intent by locking it down on coop 
</I>&gt;<i> members, I would like to hear your reasoning behind it. I don't think the 
</I>&gt;<i> platform will be unmanageable if it is open to all Ashland citizens from the 
</I>&gt;<i> start, but I might be wrong. It needs a long beta phase though and some 
</I>&gt;<i> committed users/activists. This is most crucial imo, to get &quot;makers&quot; as users 
</I>&gt;<i> who share this vision.
</I>
I suppose at some point early on, if there were enough interest from non-members in the larger community that restriction could be lifted. 
That said, a significant percentage of the local community is already a member of the Co-op (perhaps a third...or more). And, the Co-op might more readily agree to *sponsor* the beta test if it were *contained* in house...so to speak. I could be wrong about this. I don't see this as something we need to set in stone at this point.
