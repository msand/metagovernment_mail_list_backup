<PRE>Hi Conseo,

&gt;<i> Is there some issue/management system 
</I>&gt;<i> in place for the coop which could be extended in this direction (e.g. as a 
</I>&gt;<i> web-issue-tracker)?
</I>
The Co-op doesn't have any web forum/issue/management system that I am aware of. The closest they come (to that) is a comment/suggestion/question box inside the store next to a bulletin board where they post answers from whomever the comments/questions/suggestions are directed towards. Having something like this online where members could more easily read other members contributions...and work together on proposed *suggestions/solutions* could be a real benefit.
I think it could be a great tool for improving member interface with management.

&gt;<i> I have some micromanagement/community-tool/wiki in mind, 
</I>&gt;<i> probably integrated in either social networks or mobile work-flows of the 
</I>&gt;<i> workers, open to outside contributions, whatever makes sense. It's difficult 
</I>&gt;<i> to judge from here. I know Scrum and agile concepts for bottom-up software 
</I>&gt;<i> development and project management. Votorola is also available. I could also 
</I>&gt;<i> have a look at similar coops here, probably after exams, and look if one can 
</I>&gt;<i> cooperate on production technology over the web similar to Open Source 
</I>&gt;<i> Ecology, for example. (2)
</I>
That all sounds interesting. I'm working on an outline for what I have in mind. I'll need a few more days to put it together.
In the meantime, could you (or somebody) suggest which *practice* would work for the type of *collaborative proposal development* we've been discussing?
I'd like to begin familiarizing myself with what is already *imagined* or available.

&gt;<i> I can also imagine something like Kickstarter where 
</I>&gt;<i> people collectively raise resources to match a budget and then execute the 
</I>&gt;<i> plan together. (1) The platform would be open (source) and community run 
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>
Yes, what I have in mind would need a funding platform...something like Kickstarter, but &quot;open (source) and community run&quot;.

&gt;<i> Mike and me have lately talked about a production process where the amount of 
</I>&gt;<i> labour and materials supplied to the machine works like consent, the more you 
</I>&gt;<i> support a process, the more comes out of it. (This can also be hooked into 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion forums, ofc. and would be transparent.) This would even be 
</I>&gt;<i> something like a living machine, cybernetics with collective consciousness. 
</I>&gt;<i> The electronics have become incredibly cheap for this, ~40$ for a Raspberry 
</I>&gt;<i> Pi, which I already have here and can wire up to hardware. I don't what 
</I>&gt;<i> production/logistics machinery you have though.
</I>
This is where I get a little lost. Maybe you could explain a bit more of what this is, or would look like.
