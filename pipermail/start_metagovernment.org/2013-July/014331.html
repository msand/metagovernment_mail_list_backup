<PRE>Hi Conseo and Stephen,

Very well then: let us prepare a proposal to present to the Ashland Co-op!

Stephen, you have made a great start at outlining your proposal. Do you 
think the outline needs more, or is it ready to serve as the basis for 
the proposal itself?

Conseo, what about Stephen's outline? Any amendments or additions?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Ashland Food Co-op is directly associated with 2 other co-ops here in S. Oregon....one of which is a Credit Union. The other is a farm and garden 'Grange' cooperative. Both the Food Co-op and the Grange Co-op are directly affiliated with their respective *national* associations....perhaps the Credit union is as well. So that could potentially make the next step in scaling a little easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, from my perspective, the Food Co-op would be an ideal place to begin because it has a fairly active member base that is already working on a variety of very progressive issues. If we could develop what is already existing into a coherent, self-organizing system with a foundation to resource itself...I think it would be a very attractive and powerful model for scaling through the Co-op's various (above mentioned) associations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And finally, the community of Ashland is fairly homogeneous in terms of it's progressive orientation. It's kind of a bubble here that way. In other words, there isn't the degree of polarity here that exists socially, politically, and environmentally in other realms. I'm not in anyway saying I think this would be a slam dunk. I just think it would be a more 'user friendly' place to begin.
