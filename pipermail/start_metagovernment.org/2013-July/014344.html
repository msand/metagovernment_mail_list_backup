<PRE>Hi Conseo, (Great Post!)

(As an aside, I appreciated and agree with your post on the &quot;Proposal to 
Ashland Co-op&quot; thread yesterday: it would be helpful to know some of the 
real world &quot;growing tip&quot; problems now facing the co-op, to use as 
concrete examples. (No pressure Stephen ...) :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; You have seen that Votorola is basically bolted on a
    Sematic-Media-Wiki (it is our DB and at the heart of the
    architecture + even shared by the metagovernment.org wiki)?

Ned&gt; Yes, I have. And, I could say a lot about the technical design of 
Votorola, but there would not be much point in doing so: my remarks 
would undoubtedly exceed your &quot;tldr&quot; attention span. (This post is 
already going to be redlining in that regard ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; Every requirement outlined above is covered by
    prototype-software on <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/">http://zelea.com/w/</A> 

Ned&gt; As Mike has pointed out to me in no uncertain terms, Votorola is 
not a decision system. It does not make decisions. The practice that I 
laid out to Stephen does make decisions.

Ned&gt; Also, the practice I was suggesting (a first step on a long road) 
involves no database functionality at all. Implicitly, I was merely 
suggesting that typing the text of proposals into wiki-pages would be a 
better choice than typing the text into emails or forum posts or blog 
entries.

Ned&gt; Also again, the practice I was suggesting does not involve voting. 
The page to which you linked clearly says at the top:

    Welcome to our pollwiki. This is a prototype of a multi-area
    pollwiki and streetwiki for deployment in an open voting network
    such as Outcast. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; I admit that the homepage practices are distracting from
    this fact atm. because we have specified concrete possible practice
    applications for our new indirection feature in the delegational
    tree (pipes).

Ned&gt; There is no delegation in discourse-driven decision making. 
Participants participate through engaging in discourse. In that 
discourse, all voices (all proposals) are &quot;equal&quot; in the sense that it 
does not matter how many people are &quot;backing&quot; each proposal, either 
directly or through delegation.

    Communicative action is thus an inherently consensual form of social
    coordination in which actors &#8220;mobilize the potential for
    rationality&#8221; given with ordinary language and its telos of
    rationally motivated agreement. -- Stanford Encyclopedia of
    Philosophy: Habermas &lt;<A HREF="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/</A>&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; Our problem so far has been the lack of real users, not the
    lack of implementing your/our requirements.

Ned&gt; The primary requirement is that the decision be made through 
discourse, rather than through counting heads. Votorola does not make 
decisions, and uses voting and delegation to not make those decisions. 
Votorola does not make decisions through discourse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; I agree with you that the homepage is overwhelmingly complex
    as a result and we need to fix that.

Ned&gt; You have my full empathy on that one: with my stuff, I have put 
great effort into trying to present it without the presentation being 
overwhelmingly complex, as yet with little success.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; But more generally you make up differences between
    &quot;vote-based&quot; and discourse based systems very quickly, because all
    Votorola does in the different practices is route assent and
    document it publicly.

Ned&gt; In discourse decision making, there is no &quot;routing&quot; of assent. When 
there is no dissent, the process of reaching the decision is complete. 
The work is to resolve articulated objections through discourse, not to 
accumulate ever more &quot;like button&quot; assents through smiling at people or 
whatever.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; It is not per se a decision system or constructs indirect
    process, it does not calculate final results or determines winners.

Ned&gt; It really doesn't matter whether Votorola &quot;officially&quot; calculates 
final results or determines winners. In the sphere of polyarchy 
politics, the propaganda value of the Votorola numbers will be all that 
matters.

Ned&gt; Because (as Alex has suggested) directing power is power, Votorola 
(to the extent that it becomes popular) will function as yet another 
campaigning and lobbying group, along with the League of Women Voters 
and the American Association of Retired Persons.

Ned&gt; Because Votorola uses voting and delegation, the system can be 
easily gamed by the rich and powerful and well-connected and 
charismatic. (Examples of this will become available at the point that 
Votorola is operational, and has become popular enough to be worth gaming.)

Ned&gt; (I could be wrong about all of this. These are my guesses. We will 
find out at the point that Votorola has become popular enough to matter.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; Generally speaking, every discourse system can result in
    decisions and every vote-counting system (e.g. boring quantitive
    ones) can spawn further public reflection.

Ned&gt; I agree that polling results can spawn valuable public reflection, 
and can serve as valuable input for discourse decision making. I also 
agree that it is a bad idea to use polling results as the sole input for 
decision making (which is what voting systems do).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; Discourse systems are of a very different quality though,
    because they give the user much more expressiveness and allow to
    find solutions by synthesis, as metagovernment has coined it with
    the dialectical term, and not the mechanism of the decision process.

Ned&gt; (I don't quite understand this sentence ...) I agree that decision 
making through discourse is the best means we have (until the Vulcan 
Mind-Meld practice becomes more widely available) to try to reliably 
arrive at norms that synthesize the interests of all stakeholders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; Votorola is designed with that at heart, the practices are
    only suggestions to help find common positions.

Ned&gt; Votorola (it appears to me) provides no support for decision making 
through discourse. There are various points (for example in Validity 
Seeking) that the system instructs: &quot;Go do some discoursing!&quot; but that 
is not, to my mind, the same as providing support for decision making 
through discourse. (Blinap does provide support for decision making 
through discourse.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; Making a decision is easy once you build consensus. This is
    the hard part though ...

Ned&gt; For any particular decision, consensus is not built in a vacuum. 
Through discussing the initial proposal, and discussing objections to 
it, and discussing alternatives to it and the objections to those 
alternatives, agreement is eventually reached (or not). The agreement 
reached is the decision, and is the consensus. The process is not: 
&quot;first build consensus, then make decision&quot;.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; Our theoretically underlining practice is discussion and the
    soft force of better reasoning (to paraphrase Habermas' discourse
    theory, which we rely upon, see esp. the &quot;patch relaying&quot; practice).

Ned&gt; I confess that, not infrequently, I find your interpretations and 
applications of Habermas ... breathtaking. When I look at the Patch 
Relaying practice, I see concepts that (to me) seem to have no 
connection to rational discourse or communicative action: &quot;candidate&quot;, 
&quot;local discussion&quot;, &quot;downstream&quot;, &quot;approval&quot;, &quot;patch application&quot;, 
&quot;branch&quot;, &quot;mirroring branch&quot;, and so on. At the same time, what I do not 
see are concepts that I *do* associate with rational discourse and 
communicative action, beginning with the concept of a proposed 
objection, and including objections to objections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; It is not meant as a voting tool in the way you see it to
    complement some party process or abstract arguments away with
    mechanical mathematical formula to calculate decisions or outcomes.

Ned&gt; Yes, I maybe kind of understand (and I understand why Mike goes 
back and forth between calling it a voting system and calling it a 
polling system). It is a &quot;simple&quot; polling/voting system that just counts 
heads. But then why does it need delegation? Delegation and discourse 
really don't go together. The kind of discourse that manifests 
communicative action is a discourse among equals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; All you do is mark your current preference (or stick to
    yourself) and use the collectively (publicly) gathered information
    to foster the discussion and push your perspective further, the core
    of the process is mutual *text* patching and referencing.

Ned&gt; Gathering and distributing all relevant information to all and only 
those who may be interested is a good example of the kind of support 
that discourse needs, and that Votorola does not provide. Text patching 
support is only one of many, many kinds of support that can be useful in 
preparing and distributing and responding to proposals. Again, where is 
the support for preparing and distributing and responding to proposed 
*objections* to proposals?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; Regarding your proposal, even just setting up a Wiki (not
    adjusting or developping new software) is significant admin work and
    without a defined need, especially off-site, highly likely to fail
    (ask Ed or Mike about the overhead).

Ned&gt; Setting up a new group on wiser.org would be the work of an 
afternoon. The wiser crew would then handle all of the technical 
overhead, and they are good at it.

Ned&gt; But I agree with you, and with Ed, that &quot;it is all about 
resources.&quot; Trying to engage in discourse through plain vanilla 
wiki-pages will be extremely labor-intensive. If the group is small 
enough, it would be much better to engage in discourse over beers down 
at the local pub.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Conseo&gt; I propose to wait for more information/clarification from
    Stephen before we argue about design sketches. I don't think we are
    at odds unless we start to fight over ideas prematurely.

Ned&gt; Excellent! I heartily agree. (No pressure Stephen ...)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chief executive. There is a little bit of vote-driven direct democracy

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within the BOD deliberations (according to the &quot;emergency vote&quot; clause),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is some discourse-driven decision making going on -- WooHoo!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The practices of the Votorola model are *vote-driven* direct democratic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> practices, which are intended to &quot;influence&quot; (not replace, not control)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representative democracy forms (the BOD, the GM, etc.). The Votorola
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model (so far as I have seen) contains no discourse-driven direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democratic practices. (Various discourse practices are stuck on like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> post-it notes at various spots, but play no formal role in decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        IMPLEMENTING DISCOURSE-DRIVEN DIRECT DEMOCRACY
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be possible for the co-op to set up a fully functional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discourse-driven direct democracy system, tomorrow. It could be set up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a wiki (a networked set of wiki-pages). Wiki platforms are readily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available, and the new system could run parallel with the existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems, so that no initial changes to existing systems would be needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  From that beginning, the new system could grow and evolve organically.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The elements of the new practice might be these: (unless someone objected)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      * Anyone can propose, anything.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      * Each initial proposal goes into a new wiki-page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      * Notification is sent to everyone who has expressed interest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      * Objections (including reasons, perhaps including recommendations)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        are proposed (either into the original page, and/or into new pages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        and then cross-linked).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      * The discourse (through successive, recursive proposing) continues
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        until there are no unresolved objections to the initial proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      * At that point, the initial proposal has &quot;passed&quot;, and is ready to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        be implemented.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this system of decision making, it does not matter how many people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are &quot;for&quot; the proposal, or how many people are &quot;against&quot; the proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It only matters that there are *no unresolved objections* standing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;against&quot; the proposal. That is the fundamental difference between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;vote-driven&quot; and &quot;discourse-driven&quot; decision making.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, if you (Stephen) wished to get &quot;DDDD&quot; started within the co-op, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could propose doing so to the membership, as outlined above.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
