<PRE>Long time lurker here.

I couldn't agree more that the rules - as you call them - of money are
broken.

It's not about rules though in my opinion. Rules are enforced but their is
nothing in the way we use money that needs enforcement.

In my opinion the problems lay with the design of our national currencies.
Compared to the designs of the 14th century the designs of our contemporary
currencies have not changed at all.

Some theoretical ways in which the design could change.

- individual currency units could be taggable so that as a currency unit
passes through various hands tags could be added but never removed.

- the complete history of individual currency units could be made available
for consultation at will.

These are just two suggestions that would radically change our world beyond
recognition.

Throughout the years I've developed a potential method through via which
the transition between our current national currencies and a newly designed
currency could happen without any government intervention.

Hello everyone,

i'm sure everyone here knows theres lots of issues with democracy and
voting and lots of stuff that could be improved on that &quot;frontier&quot;, but i
came to think, that there is some very related subjects and thats equity
and money.
Equity gives you votes in the context of your equity.
Money gives you the right to buy and thus vote on who will prosper and who
will not (voting with your purse...)

I came to the conclusion, that the rules/laws around money are broken and
so are the rules around equity.

Do you know the forbes magazine and their listing of the 100 richest
persons on the planet? 98 of them are entrepreneurs, 1 is Steve Balmer from
Microsoft and the last one, i dont know.

If you want to get insanely rich, u have to abuse the broken laws for
equity, thus found and raise a successful company.
The other way would be to get into the financial industrie and instead of
abusing broken equity rules, u would abuse broken money laws.

In essence it eneables you to live of of other peoples work to some degree.
These broken laws are the main, if not the ONLY reason for the &quot;great and
ever stretching divide&quot; between rich and poor. Its also the reason for the
financial crisis.

I believe money is an issue that cannot be tackled right now and have a
couple of arguments why i think that to be true which i dont want to get
into now, but i think its totally possible to tackle the equity issue and i
believe with the equity issue tackled, the money issue will follow by
itself sooner or later.

Does this topic somehow sound interesting? If so, i would really like to
get into the details, but if there is nobody on this list who is interested
in these topics, i dont want to waste your time.

kind regards
alex
