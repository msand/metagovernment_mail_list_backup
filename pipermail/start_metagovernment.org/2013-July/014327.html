&gt;<i> Hi Ned, Conseo, (and others),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there are no reasonable objections, I would like to send the following letter to the Ashland Co-op BOD.
</I>&gt;<i> Because I am representing Metagov (to some degree), I thought it prudent to check-in with (all of) you before hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Ashland Co-op Board members,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I live in Ashland and have been a Co-op member for 25+ years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm associated with a small group of e-Democracy theorists and software developers who are designing and building toolsets + platforms + processes for a new and (hopefully) more evolved democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because the Co-op has been so successful over the years, some of us would like to inquire into a certain aspect of the Board of Directors decision making process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is currently a discussion in our forum with respect to the merit of *voting* vs. engaging in *rational discourse* until a consensus can be reached.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the Co-op By-laws (section 5.5) use of a 2/3's majority *emergency vote* is permitted if &quot;diligent efforts have failed to produce a consensus and the issue requires immediate action...&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding this *emergency vote* clause, we are curious to find answers to the following questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - How often does the Co-op BOD find itself in a position where it is unable to &quot;reconcile differing points of view based on the best interests of the Co-op&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Are there any particular issues/situations that have repeatedly triggered the use of the 2/3's majority *emergency vote* clause?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Could you briefly describe the outcomes that followed any decisions you have made by a 2/3's majority vote?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if you care to offer any further insights into this aspect of your decision making process, that would be most appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you so much,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steve Coffman (and others @ Metagovernment.org)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Ned&gt;  How many times has the &quot;emergency vote&quot; clause been invoked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    since its inception? What were the matters voted on? What were the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    outcomes produced by the voting?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Stephen&gt;  To be thorough in answering your question I would need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    go through 40 years of data/records that may or may not be so easily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    accessible. And a finding of the &quot;outcomes produced&quot; would very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    likely be someones limited and anecdotal interpretation of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    events that followed an &quot;emergency vote&quot;. I think it would be a very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    interesting question to ask. I have a close friend who was president
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    of the BOD for several years. I'll ask about this next time I see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    him and get back to you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Ashland Coop experiment has in a sense been been running discourse and voting parallel (through the Emergency Vote clause). If we-the-Metagovernment-community are now going to start directing foundations, one of the most fundamental questions we must agree on initially will be whether to use discourse only, voting, or some version of the Emergency Vote clause. This makes the experimental results produced by the Emergency Vote clause at the Ashland Coop over the last 40 years of *extreme* and *immediate* interest. (!!!) Any information that you can provide about that will be *greatly* appreciated!
