<PRE>Greetings, folks.

I have repeatedly brought up the idea of formalizing this group with a nonprofit organization, and have also repeatedly brought up numerous objections to the idea. After more reflection, I would like your input on a different approach to the same idea. 

Basically, I think I have been approaching it backwards. I have been thinking of formalizing this group into a corporate entity. But when I look at the way international organizations such as the Red Cross and Amnesty International are governed, the corporate entities are more like servants of a less well-defined global group. That sounds like a great model for us.

So I am proposing creating an American nonprofit organization. This organization would not be in control of the Metagovernment project, but rather would be (loosely) controlled by it. This would allow the organization to form within the strictures of the American tax code (which can be burdensome), but still fully maintain the collaborative governance of this group.

The big benefit of an American nonprofit is that it is the most eligible entity for applying for a large and diverse array of grants. Monies donated to the nonprofit might be earmarked by the grantors, but generally I would see funds being directed in three ways:
1. To distribute funds to member projects
2. To advance Metagov-related projects such as free-range voting
3. To publicize and strengthen the project

Performance of those tasks would be left to the nonprofit organization. But the big decisions (i.e., how to distribute funds, which Metagov projects to advance, how to characterize the project when publicizing it, etc.) would be controlled by this group using real collaborative governance.

If I go ahead with this and it works well, we could form more nonprofits in other countries and even more American ones. There's no limit, when we look at it this way.

Thoughts, objections, variants?


P.S. I'll point out a semi-personal motivation in this as well. I have very little time to commit to this group because of the demands of my employment and business venture. If I could (eventually) be employed by this nonprofit organization, I would end up with vastly more time and energy to devote to this group.
