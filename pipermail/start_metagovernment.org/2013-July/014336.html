<PRE>In a REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY, anyone can vote directly to elect (some 
of) the representatives, but cannot vote directly on proposals. On top 
of that, in large populations the effect of a single vote is vanishingly 
small, so that the individual voter has almost no say even on 
representation. The public autonomy of each individual is effectively 
not appreciably greater than it would be in a dictatorship.

In a VOTE-DRIVEN DIRECT DEMOCRACY, anyone can vote directly on any 
proposal. But again, in large populations the effect of a single vote is 
vanishingly small, which means that the public autonomy of each 
individual is nearly non-existent, and only slightly better than it 
would be in a dictatorship. (Delegation cannot help: including 
transitive delegation in the mix cannot increase public autonomy of the 
individual beyond the level set by the original vote.)

In a DISCOURSE-DRIVEN DIRECT DEMOCRACY, anyone can participate directly 
in making any public decision, on equal footing &quot;without dilution&quot;. 
Participation and decision making occur through discourse. This means 
that the public autonomy of each individual is as full as it can be and 
still be equal. (And the amazing thing is, when people are forced to 
work together to create a solution that works for everyone ... they do! 
And these solutions are much stronger, better, and longer-lasting than 
decisions made by voting.)

We can choose. Which type of democracy shall we adopt?

</I>&gt;<i>     pitch is, by necessity, going to gloss over a lot of detail. It's
</I>&gt;<i>     a sales pitch, and it should be ~30 seconds long.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So, I've made a few drafts and come up with the following (which I

</I>&gt;<i>     and/or how it could be improved and/or what your elevator pitch is.

</I>&gt;<i>     Every time we vote someone into power, we lose all control over
</I>&gt;<i>     the decisions they make until the next time we get to vote.
</I>&gt;<i>     Metagovernment is a global group of people creating internet tools
</I>&gt;<i>     that let you delegate your vote to whomever you want, withdraw it
</I>&gt;<i>     whenever you want, or keep it for yourself and vote directly on
</I>&gt;<i>     the issues that matter most to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     By their nature, these tools don't work with a majority rule
</I>&gt;<i>     system. Instead, they use a sophisticated consensus model.
</I>&gt;<i>     Computers and internet connectivity really help with that. The
</I>&gt;<i>     amazing thing is, when people are forced to work together to
</I>&gt;<i>     create a solution that works for everyone... they do! And these
</I>&gt;<i>     solutions are much stronger, better, and longer-lasting than the
</I>&gt;<i>     decisions made by small groups of representatives who inevitably
</I>&gt;<i>     make political compromises, if not purely selfish decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     We're not expecting our tools to take hold in national governments
</I>&gt;<i>     at first. But voting for representatives happens in many
</I>&gt;<i>     different communities we're involved in: social clubs, nonprofit
</I>&gt;<i>     organizations, homeowner associations, community groups, school
</I>&gt;<i>     boards, and so on. We expect our tools to take foot in the
</I>&gt;<i>     smallest communities, and expand from there as people get used to
</I>&gt;<i>     the idea of taking control of -- and thus responsibility for --
</I>&gt;<i>     their democracies.
