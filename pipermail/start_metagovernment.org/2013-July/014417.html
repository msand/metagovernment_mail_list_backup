What the IRS (and any foundation that may consider providing a grant to the organization) is looking for is accountability. There have to be individuals who can be blamed for mismanagement of funds; individuals who are responsible and accountable for actions made. I am more than willing to take on that accountability, but that means that the board has to be less than just puppets.

I am wondering if the co-op model might be the right basis for a Metagov organization. I am considering paying for some advice from the Foundation Group (an org which serves to help other orgs get started), but I would like to have as much input from this group as possible before I go down that path.

Yes, Mike, what do you think? Creating the bylaws for a Metagovernment organization would be a real-world practice in governance building. It differs from all the self-governance we have done in the past in that there will be money on the line. Some of the decisions made by the Metagov organization (if I can eventually get it formed and then get grants from foundations) will funnel money to other individuals and projects here. That is sure to cause competition and dissent... the meat and potatoes of real-world governance.
