<PRE>Hi Ned, (and Ed)

&gt;<i> ... if a proposal constitutes a vote, is it also true that pretty
</I>&gt;<i> much any speech act of rational discourse constitutes a vote of some
</I>&gt;<i> kind?
</I>
By definition, it must be formalized.  Speech alone is not enough.

&gt;<i> If we add Ed's (to me) clearly valid suggestion (that the spectators
</I>&gt;<i> of a discourse, if they are free to participate, are voting when
</I>&gt;<i> they do not participate) ...
</I>
Far from voting, they do nothing.  That's all we know and all we can
rightly claim.  Any further interpretation of their inaction belongs
to us alone; we cannot rightly attribute it to them.

Mike

&gt;<i> Hi Mike and Ed, (Great Responses -- much appreciated!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So Mike, if a proposal constitutes a vote, is it also true that pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> much any speech act of rational discourse constitutes a vote of some kind?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If proposals constitute votes, then discourse always has voting built 
</I>&gt;<i> into it, so that discourse can be decisive. Am I missing something?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we add Ed's (to me) clearly valid suggestion (that the spectators of 
</I>&gt;<i> a discourse, if they are free to participate, are voting when they do 
</I>&gt;<i> not participate), then again, public discourse always has voting built 
</I>&gt;<i> into it, and can be decisive. Again, am I missing something? Why would 
</I>&gt;<i> you assert that discourse cannot be decisive, if discourse has voting 
</I>&gt;<i> intrinsically embedded in it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we use your definition of voting, and if voting is, as you suggest, 
</I>&gt;<i> built into discourse, then the distinction I have been trying to express 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps becomes that between &quot;naked voting&quot; (votes cast outside of 
</I>&gt;<i> discourse) and &quot;discourse voting&quot; (votes cast through discourse). 
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola uses &quot;naked voting&quot;. Blinap uses only &quot;discourse voting&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My contention is that we would be better off to use only discourse 
</I>&gt;<i> voting in our (decisive) public decision systems, in order to bring to 
</I>&gt;<i> bear upon democratic decision making the values of discourse that 
</I>&gt;<i> Habermas talks about. Naked voting does not bring those values to bear.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It looks to me like *everyone* votes in #4. To quote an old Rush song, &quot;If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.&quot; Or more formally: consent is a form of assent. Those votes are then formalized in #5 by implementation.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; You have asserted that voting is a form of decision making, and that discourse is not a form of decision making, because it cannot be decisive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Consider the following sequence of events:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   1. A proposer proposes a proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   2. Notification of the proposal is sent to millions of members.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   3. The proposal successfully passes through all existing and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      applicable &quot;proposal criteria filters&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   4. No one proposes any objections to implementing the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   5. The proposal is implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This sequence of events has been decisive. If, as you say, discourse cannot be decisive, then voting (or sortition) must have been involved. So, please: show me the votes.
