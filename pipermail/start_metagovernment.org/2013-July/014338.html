<PRE>A few months back I made an offhand comment (here) that I now realize was stated incorrectly. I believe I said something like &quot;the toolsets are boring&quot;. I don't remember the context of the conversation. 

What I should have said is this, &quot;whenever I try to understand the tools, what they do, and how they work, I feel really stupid&quot;. Because that's my experience when I look at the Votorola page on &quot;Practices&quot;...for instance. I love the diagrams as they really help me understand the underlying structures on a visceral level. But when I read the text about &quot;containment, variation, account sinking, free flying&quot;, etc. I get stupid really fast. I want to understand all of that....but so many of the concepts are so foreign to me, I just about can't read a paragraph without landing on my face.    

So, I regret the comment I made as it was a rude thing to say....and I'm just now seeing what underpinned it.

I feel like someone from the 1950's who has just been given an iPad and told to 'go surf the net'. On a theoretical level I really get what you guys are doing....and I have the utmost respect towards you for even imagining these new forms of collaboration. I want to be able to work with you in some way. But I feel pretty dumb-ass (here), most of the time.


I'm actually not a stupid man though. And I think a fairly large percentage of the human population (your constituency) would feel similarly if they came upon these same concepts and language-ings.

My sense is that someone from the fifties would need to begin with a simple cordless phone in order to not be completely overwhelmed.&quot; Wow, I don't need a wire, unbelievable&quot;. I remember watching star trek when it first came out thinking their wireless communication devices were, like, from another planet. 
,
From where most people are today.... e-Democracy is a very 'futuristic' concept. I shared some of the Votarola pages (which I think are awesome BTW) with my brother a while back thinking I would be able to impress him with the whole concept of e-D. His response was &quot;let me know when you guys are done playing in the sandbox&quot;. He was sooo not interested....and he's a very politically guy.

As I've said recently, I live in a fairly progressive town. When I talk to my friends about &quot;this bunch of guys (I think you are all guys), who are actually writing code for a totally awesome system of global collaboration&quot;.... they kind of go &quot;huh?...oh cool&quot;....end of conversation. 

To get even a modest percentage of the human population interested in switching to such a radically complex framework of self-governance is going to be an enormous task. Unless it can be made to appeal greatly to other parts of the human psyche, I'm just not seeing it before we all turn to toast.

No... let me say it this way.

Like most Americans, I sit down one or two times a year and read my voters handbook, and after a little deliberation and discussion among some friends and my partner, I start filling in circles with a pencil. This system is the rotary-dial-up-method of governance.

What you are asking (normal) people to comprehend in the concept of *Meta-governance* is an 'internet' of complexity relative to what is familiar and comfortable to them. Most people just aren't going to go there unless you can dress it up a bit, make it a little simpler, and pleeeez,,,, make it a little more fun.....even then.....?

OK...I'll shut up after this.

I think people will need to begin somewhere south of 'Patch relaying' and 'Position space rationalization' if we are ever going to 'see the light of dawn'.

..........................................

Does any of that make sense....or am I totally in the nut tree?

I'm not in any way intending this to be a 'dis' because I absolutely love what you all are doing. 

And I really want to be able to use these tools.....really soon. 

With utmost sincerity,

Steve
