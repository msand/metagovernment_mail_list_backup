<PRE>Stephen and Ed,

&gt;<i> &gt; My immediate need is for a baseline of informal yet more-or-less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; purposeful discussion.  I need it as a reference horizon against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which to develop the tools and practices.  Even the thinnest of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussion baselines would be enough, but it must be long-lived
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and available on demand.
</I>

I'm sorry I missed this earlier, Stephen.  Thanks for suggesting it.
It depends on longevity and size.  If the discussion on a given bylaw
is expected to run for months, and to involve several participants at
a time (myself included), then that should suffice.  I could probably
learn something useful during that time.

The participants would have to carry the discussion without support
from Votorola.  We develop supports, of course.  I'll be using them
myself and others may, too.  But they won't be expected to; it will
always be enough just to participate in the discussion.

&gt;<i> Yes, Mike, what do you think? Creating the bylaws for a
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment organization would be a real-world practice in
</I>&gt;<i> governance building. It differs from all the self-governance we have
</I>&gt;<i> done in the past in that there will be money on the line. Some of
</I>&gt;<i> the decisions made by the Metagov organization (if I can eventually
</I>&gt;<i> get it formed and then get grants from foundations) will funnel
</I>&gt;<i> money to other individuals and projects here. That is sure to cause
</I>&gt;<i> competition and dissent... the meat and potatoes of real-world
</I>&gt;<i> governance.
</I>
I hope it's possible to get something started.  Failing large sums of
money to attact interest, there's also what you mentioned earlier
about models.  Lifting a given issue beyond the scope of Metagov would
open the opportunity to extend the discussion across multiple forums.
This is the environment I would prefer to work in, because Votorola is
designed for use at larger scales.

Mike
