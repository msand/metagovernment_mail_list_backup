<PRE>Hi Stephen,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Conseo,
</I>&gt;<i> Very good questions. I really appreciate your taking the time to respond. I
</I>&gt;<i> answered most of your questions. Some questions seemed similar to others,
</I>&gt;<i> so I passed on them. If I missed anything please ask again.
</I>
Sure. I just take some days to think about and when I am ready I reply, so it 
might take a bit longer sometimes, but this doesn't mean I am not interested. 
On the opposite, I try to think it through.


&gt;<i> Yes. We could let the process *weed out* those proposals that don't line up
</I>&gt;<i> with the *interests* of the community. That would simplify things
</I>&gt;<i> substantially. Though, I think there should still be at least be some
</I>&gt;<i> *suggested criteria* for those making proposals, and for those doing the
</I>&gt;<i> weeding out of those proposals that don't 'line up'. This would perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> simplify the process even more by eliminating a lot of arguing down the
</I>&gt;<i> road in determining whether some &quot;non-sense or evil proposal&quot; should be
</I>&gt;<i> supported...or not.
</I>
Ok. Suggestions are no problem, filtering is imo.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, at least initially, the proposers and audience/users would appraise the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals (for) themselves within the process of &quot;arguing&quot;?
</I>
Ideally, yes. You can also reformulate that as: The process should be as 
simple as possible and work &quot;out of the box&quot; even if you are alone and want to 
collect support. But it does not tell how to get there yet, so focus and help 
is definitely needed.


&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Everybody should have the possibility to join the platform, in fact it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be an attractor for coop membership, not an exclusive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (discriminatory) electorate. Or is there a risk involved here?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we need to draw a line somewhere. Including the larger community of
</I>&gt;<i> Ashland in the beginning might be bit much. But yes, anyone who isn't
</I>&gt;<i> already a Co-op member could simply join (the Co-op) if they wanted to be
</I>&gt;<i> involved in the process. And then, once it's up and running, that
</I>&gt;<i> *criteria* could be dropped or extended to the next scale. This is a little
</I>&gt;<i> tricky because we don't want to discriminate...and we want to contain it so
</I>&gt;<i> that we don't have a multitude of proposers/users/on-lookers overwhelming
</I>&gt;<i> the system.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dead proposals could be (re)moved&quot;....perhaps at the end of each cycle
</I>&gt;<i> those proposals without any active development taking place (need
</I>&gt;<i> descriptors here) would be tossed.
</I>
Yes, but I would rather take small and easy issues and support them (by 
funding and personel), while allowing the community to explore more difficult 
ones if they like to. Limiting the electorate is risky imo, see below. We can 
limit issues to not stress the tooling, but we should make that explicit 
instead of simply deciding it: Currently in beta, joining the &quot;drafters&quot; (not 
voters!) only through invitations... That way people can help solve the 
problems on the way.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Membership consensus would be attained if there are no *reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; objections* to the proposal one week following notification of a call for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; objections.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A week is a bit short, imagine you are on vacation. I would make it a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; month
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and, yes, consensus is the default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A month seems a bit long to me. Most people stay *connected* wherever they
</I>&gt;<i> are/go. And if they can't follow along for some reason they could possibly
</I>&gt;<i> set up a proxy. I'm not attached to one week, but I'm concerned that if a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal is in the wings for a month, (waiting for someone to get back from
</I>&gt;<i> vacation), it might lose it's momentum.
</I>
Ok, I don't have a problem with a week if the issues are &quot;small&quot;. Maybe two 
weeks is a good compromise?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you misunderstood my position. I'm referring to the ability of the
</I>&gt;<i> Network to determine whether an *objection* (that Is holding up consensus
</I>&gt;<i> on a proposal) is *reasonable*...or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say:
</I>&gt;<i> Mary proposes to have a separate homeless shelter for women and children
</I>&gt;<i> because of some past safety issues resulting from combining men and women
</I>&gt;<i> in that kind of situation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone agrees except John, who (deep inside) feels threatened and
</I>&gt;<i> abandoned by women and doesn't want to give them any special treatment. He
</I>&gt;<i> argues that having a *combined* shelter would instead give men and women an
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to *work things out*...together. He feels very strongly about
</I>&gt;<i> this and isn't open to any gender separation...and therefore blocks
</I>&gt;<i> consensus.
</I>
Very well chosen, even if it still is constructed. No, this problem was on my 
mind as well, but I want you to make it explicit, because I am too deeply 
involved in the tech. This is very important to nail down, because I think the 
concepts and reality do not fit well together atm. so don't be shy in pointing 
out risks and contradictions. We want to address them as well as possible to 
avoid failure.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I realize this is a bit imaginative...but, in the type of process we are
</I>&gt;<i> developing, there are likely to be situations where one individual is
</I>&gt;<i> blocking consensus because of some personal wounding (or vested interest),
</I>&gt;<i> and the community is held hostage because of someone's individual process
</I>&gt;<i> or selfish interest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The question for me is: who decides whether an objection is *reasonable* or
</I>&gt;<i> not?
</I>
Right, this (always) contradicts the process unless consent is reached, which 
was the problem to start with. It's the hen egg problem, because democracy 
itself is abstract and does not solve the real problems in practical terms.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my mind there are risks going both ways. On the one hand, having a *panel
</I>&gt;<i> of elected arbiters/judges* risks introducing an element of elitism. On the
</I>&gt;<i> other hand, to introduce a *subjective* constraint, i.e. &quot;a proposal passes
</I>&gt;<i> if there are no *reasonable* objections&quot;...without some way of determining
</I>&gt;<i> which objections are *reasonable*, runs the risk of sabotaging the
</I>&gt;<i> process....with no way of preventing endless argument about which objection
</I>&gt;<i> is reasonable and which is not. A determination will need to be made
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere...somehow.  Or we just drop *reasonable* and open it up to
</I>&gt;<i> 'objection' on any grounds whatsoever.
</I>
Exactly, this is the contradiction of liberal democracy. I don't think it is a 
consistent concept, at least we have the problem that either it does not work 
and cannot really help to resolve issues like real-world social conflicts, 
e.g. like the user story above, or that it in fact discriminates against some 
minority to become executable, either by:
- restricting the electorate
- picking a majority rule: simple majority, 50%, 2/3, ...
- creating separately elected bodies
- forcing some decision by timing

I don't think the constraints are very smart though, because they mechanically 
limit the potential of the process to make it executable in the first place. 
So imo we have to apply constraints only to finally get to consensus, 
otherwise the tooling might prove hypocritical, weak and pointless, because it 
should help you increase your reach and get real world support, which can only 
happen through consensus.

It would be very good if you could formulate your Wiki page in terms of a 
problem (one or more user stories) and a solution (also user stories) and 
document the risks as well (e.g. a simple list or again user stories like the 
one above between John and Mary). I can help you with it, but I would prefer 
you to cover the user stories (you can also ask other people ofc.).

My current idea is that 3/4 of voters, 2 weeks + whole community of Ashland 
might be the best compromise, but it is still difficult to judge and this is 
our real risk, that we make the process unattractive, because the tooling does 
not really bring potentially conflicting people together. The compromise does 
point at consensus already though imo.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think having a grant program as an integral element of the process would
</I>&gt;<i> be a big attractor towards drawing in proposals...and participation in the
</I>&gt;<i> process of developing them.
</I>
Yes, I am not against the program, but have hopes about it. I just would keep 
the platform open to different funding parties (in fact crowd-sourcing from 
anybody) or if this causes problems at least not bake the functionality for 
this single coop at core. This is an implementation detail though, we can 
start with the coop only, if it really wants to be exclusive in this domain. I 
don't think this is very smart and helpful though.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand that grant cycle, but this should be completely free to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decide for the coop, I guess. It is then not coupled to the process and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important how they decide that (e.g. how they set deadlines in their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal version for their funding).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Remember, with respect to Co-op membership, *they* is *we*.
</I>
Ok, I will say &quot;you&quot; then.

&gt;<i> My thinking here is to make the *self-organinzing* element more fluid by
</I>&gt;<i> lowering the threshold necessary for evolving the process. Some people
</I>&gt;<i> simply resist change on grounds that aren't very reasonable (in my mind).
</I>&gt;<i> Again, there are risks going both ways. I'm suggesting using 3/4 majority
</I>&gt;<i> because I can imagine some people disagreeing to any change just because
</I>&gt;<i> they're comfortable with the status quo. My fear is that the process would
</I>&gt;<i> stagnate and not evolve if consensus was requisite for any process change.
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I feel there are times when the majority holds enough wisdom to be
</I>&gt;<i> trusted. And, at least initially, there will be a lot of bugs to work out.
</I>&gt;<i> Requiring a consensus for process changes could really slow things down,
</I>&gt;<i> IMO.  And finally, I can easily imagine a 3/4 majority agreeing to making
</I>&gt;<i> consensus requisite for a process change...if things were moving/changing
</I>&gt;<i> to quickly or unwisely.
</I>
Ok, we just have to know the trade-off. To reformulate the arguments above on 
this specific constraint:
3/4 already endorses consent, because of the risk that the minority you are 
discriminating against today will make you fail the next time. We cannot 
enforce consensus with the tooling anyhow. 
But what is important to point out is that consensus is more powerful and if 
you can reach some neutral grounds to prove and develop your competing ideas, 
individual freedom of the conflicting parties so to speak, then tooling helps 
you more, not less and allows to find out how consensus in the issue could 
look like on a &quot;deeper level&quot;. Just getting enough support to push through 
execution is not sustainable and leaves the potential power of the tooling (to 
help to reach some even if only formal) consent unexperienced. But maybe you 
can bring these arguments back to plain reality and break it down in concrete 
applications. I am ok with 3/4 to start with.

&gt;<i> I suppose at some point early on, if there were enough interest from
</I>&gt;<i> non-members in the larger community that restriction could be lifted. That
</I>&gt;<i> said, a significant percentage of the local community is already a member
</I>&gt;<i> of the Co-op (perhaps a third...or more). And, the Co-op might more readily
</I>&gt;<i> agree to *sponsor* the beta test if it were *contained* in house...so to
</I>&gt;<i> speak. I could be wrong about this. I don't see this as something we need
</I>&gt;<i> to set in stone at this point.
</I>
To summarize: I am not pointing to consensus for moral purity. Every friction 
of the consensus/electorate is a weakening of the process and can make it lose 
legitimacy or economic power, deadlock and fail. I would therefore avoid these 
restrictions whenever possible, but allow them to not render the process 
unexecutable. It is easier to ease them on the way than to introduce them 
afterwards imo, as long as we have executable issues/scenarios to start with.
