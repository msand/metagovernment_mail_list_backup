Mike, could you go into a bit more depth about what you're seeking? The idea of interrelating discussions/proposals came up early in the history of this list, and the consensus leaned toward tagging as the most flexible, organic, and reliable system in the long run (cc'ing Pietro, as he was deep in that discussion).

Manual tagging seems very clumsy when you're talking about aggregating potentially large amounts of data in different formats, but a bit of extra manual labor isn't necessarily a bad thing. After all, the content of Wikipedia (including most inter-linkages) is all basically hand-crafted. That human touch adds an editorial review that full automation can't achieve.

But on the semi-automated side, it is worth noting that subject-lines and first sentences often provide a natural tagging as well. For example, I changed the subject line of this thread because I was changing the focus: which is a form of latent tagging. So even in systems without a tag architecture, there is some tag data that can be harvested.

But I am also suggesting that you can impose tags from Votorola onto any discussion. If each comment/post/email in any forum is considered an independent object by Votorola (I'm assuming here), then wouldn't it be fairly easy to allow each Votorola user add tags to any object as they please?
