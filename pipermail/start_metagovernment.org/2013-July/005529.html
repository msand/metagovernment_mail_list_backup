<PRE>To make the implicit explicit, you are reporting that a social system 
design featuring private_ownership + voting + oligarchy + hierarchy has 
proved to be &quot;good enough&quot; as a way to organize and run a local grocery 
store, from your perspective.

Are you also proposing anything, and/or responding to my proposal? (My 
proposal is mainly concerned with public decisions at the scale of 
populations, but does have ramifications for local grocery stores.)

How many times has the &quot;emergency vote&quot; clause been invoked since its 
inception? What were the matters voted on? What were the outcomes 
produced by the voting?

Has the store ever been picketed by protesters who had no better way to 
&quot;make their voices heard&quot; with respect to the decision making done by 
the Elected Oligarchy In Charge?

Are the paid staff enjoying being wage-slaves and working in a 
hierarchy? (Would they prefer that the store be worker-owned rather than 
customer-owned?)

Are the buildings and grounds of the store subject to zoning 
regulations? Are any of the items for sale by the store subject to 
regulation? Do the store and/or its employees pay taxes? (If so, then 
the internal governance system of the store is not the whole story. 
Would you consider The Whole Story of the way the store is governed to 
be working pretty well?)

Given that member ownership seems to be working well for the store, do 
you think that member ownership would work well for planet Earth? (That 
is, all tangible property other than individual mind/body/spirit owned 
collectively by Humanity + Nature + Future Generations.)

(Some of these questions will need their own threads ...)

</I>&gt;<i> I just read the bylaws of the Ashland Food Coop of which I am a member. We've been around for 40 years. We have 8100 owner/members. Our projected sales for 2013 are 28.8 million. We are debt free.  It is a very lively and extremely successful enterprise by all reasonable standards.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
&gt;<i> Here is the section of our bylaws regarding decision making:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The board shall strive to make decisions by consensus, attempting to reconcile differing points of view based upon the interests of the Co-op. If, in the opinion of a majority of directors present, diligent efforts have failed to produce a consensus and the issue requires immediate action, then such issue shall be decided by a two-thirds majority of directors.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could imagine the directors might get themselves into trouble at some point interpreting the words.....&quot;interests&quot; and &quot;diligent&quot;. But on the whole, it seems to be working quite well for them/us. We're one of the strongest co-ops in the country. Our system is hierarchical and as members, we use voting to select the directors as well as to change our bylaws. I've shopped there for 25 years and I can tell you they/we do a really amazing job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my view, our system works because:  We're member owned and operated. The invitation to participate is always there. Rational communication and action occur regularly at all levels. I wouldn't say that we've have found the best way to organize...but it seems to work pretty well.
