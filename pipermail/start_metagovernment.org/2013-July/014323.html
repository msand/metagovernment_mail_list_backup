<PRE>Hi Ed,

For me, reading your post felt like watching a slot machine turn up, one 
by one, a solid row of cherries -- Jackpot! What you are suggesting 
makes sense from every perspective I can think of.

</I>&gt;<i> I have repeatedly brought up the idea of formalizing this group with a 
</I>&gt;<i> nonprofit organization, and have also repeatedly brought up numerous 
</I>&gt;<i> objections to the idea. After more reflection, I would like your input 
</I>&gt;<i> on a different approach to the same idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, I think I have been approaching it backwards. I have been 
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of formalizing this group into a corporate entity. But when I 
</I>&gt;<i> look at the way international organizations such as the Red Cross and 
</I>&gt;<i> Amnesty International are governed, the corporate entities are more 
</I>&gt;<i> like servants of a less well-defined global group. That sounds like a 
</I>&gt;<i> great model for us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I am proposing creating an American nonprofit organization. This 
</I>&gt;<i> organization would not be *in control* of the Metagovernment project, 
</I>&gt;<i> but rather would be (loosely) *controlled by* it. This would allow the 
</I>&gt;<i> organization to form within the strictures of the American tax code 
</I>&gt;<i> (which can be burdensome), but still fully maintain the collaborative 
</I>&gt;<i> governance of this group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The big benefit of an American nonprofit is that it is the most 
</I>&gt;<i> eligible entity for applying for a large and diverse array of grants. 
</I>&gt;<i> Monies donated to the nonprofit might be earmarked by the grantors, 
</I>&gt;<i> but generally I would see funds being directed in three ways:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. To distribute funds to member projects
</I>&gt;<i> 2. To advance Metagov-related projects such as free-range voting
</I>&gt;<i> 3. To publicize and strengthen the project
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Performance of those tasks would be left to the nonprofit 
</I>&gt;<i> organization. But the big decisions (i.e., how to distribute funds, 
</I>&gt;<i> which Metagov projects to advance, how to characterize the project 
</I>&gt;<i> when publicizing it, etc.) would be controlled by this group using 
</I>&gt;<i> real collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I go ahead with this and it works well, we could form more 
</I>&gt;<i> nonprofits in other countries and even more American ones. There's no 
</I>&gt;<i> limit, when we look at it this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts, objections, variants?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I'll point out a semi-personal motivation in this as well. I have 
</I>&gt;<i> very little time to commit to this group because of the demands of my 
</I>&gt;<i> employment and business venture. If I could (eventually) be employed 
</I>&gt;<i> by this nonprofit organization, I would end up with vastly more time 
</I>&gt;<i> and energy to devote to this group.
</I>&gt;<i>
