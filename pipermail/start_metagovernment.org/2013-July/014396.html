<PRE>Hi Ned,

I think you're answering &quot;no&quot;.  Some of your deciders have initial,
personal opinions on what the decision ought to be, but none of them
has actual knowledge.  They'd first have to acquire that knowledge.
This acquisition is what I call &quot;primary guidance&quot;.

Primary guidance is technically optional.  It's quite possible to say
what a decision *will* be, without ever knowing what it *ought* to be.
But usually this is undesireable.

Blinap may be attempting to address the deficiency by housing the
production of both the guiding knowledge (what ought to be) and the
fact of decisions (what will be) in a single system.  This would be a
design choice.

Another design choice is a specialized system that produces only the
guiding knowledge.  This is Votorola's design.  As a consequence,
Votorola is compatible with any and all decision systems that are
based on formal choice (voting), including Blinap.  This is one
advantage of a specialized design, what is called &quot;rationalization&quot;.

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; ... I would say that we don't need a separate primary guidance
</I>&gt;<i>     system. To have such a system would be unnecessary, expensive,
</I>&gt;<i>     wasteful, and distracting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; The need is to inform the deciders of what the decision ought
</I>&gt;<i>     to be. Do the deciders already have this knowledge on your &quot;planet&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     as you put it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will now make another attempt to answer the question ... :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On my planet, when an initial proposal is proposed, the proposer is one 
</I>&gt;<i> of the deciders. As decider, I guess you could say that she probably 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;already knows&quot; (that is, has an opinion about) what the decision ought 
</I>&gt;<i> to be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Notification is sent, and those who receive the notification do not, in 
</I>&gt;<i> most cases, at the beginning &quot;already know&quot; (have an opinion about) what 
</I>&gt;<i> the decision ought to be -- they have to think about it, and study, in 
</I>&gt;<i> order to come to an opinion regarding what they think the decision ought 
</I>&gt;<i> to be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As the ensuing discourse-through-proposing proceeds, individual deciders 
</I>&gt;<i> may change their opinions any number of times regarding what the 
</I>&gt;<i> decision ought to be. So, through this period I guess we could say that 
</I>&gt;<i> individual deciders may or may not &quot;already know&quot; what their opinion 
</I>&gt;<i> will wind up being by the time the decision happens.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The decision happens at the point that there are no unresolved valid 
</I>&gt;<i> objections to the implementation of some proposal (which may or may not 
</I>&gt;<i> be the initial proposal). Until that point, no one knows what will be, 
</I>&gt;<i> and each has her own opinion about what ought to be. When all of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ought to be&quot; opinions line up (through discourse), the decision 
</I>&gt;<i> happens, like the jackpot of a slot machine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a &quot;full&quot; direct democracy (which my planet has), there are not 
</I>&gt;<i> separate decision systems to deal with &quot;what ought to be&quot; and &quot;what will 
</I>&gt;<i> be&quot;. There is just the one decision system, that receives proposals from 
</I>&gt;<i> anybody and spits out what will be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I am trying my best to come up with a definitive &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> is just not happenin' ... Sorry! Your question contains implicit 
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions about &quot;how things must be&quot; that are not valid for the 
</I>&gt;<i> decision system that my planet uses.)
