<PRE>Ed, (and others in CC)

&gt;<i> Mike, could you go into a bit more depth about what you're seeking?
</I>&gt;<i> The idea of interrelating discussions/proposals came up early in the
</I>&gt;<i> history of this list, and the consensus leaned toward tagging as the
</I>&gt;<i> most flexible, organic, and reliable system in the long run (cc'ing
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro, as he was deep in that discussion).
</I>
It looks like I need a facility with the following, basic use case: *

   Show me the larger public discussion on the issue of Blah.  In what
   public threads (across all discussion media) is there talk of Blah?
   With what frequency?

Seen from the viewpoint of a thread participant, the facility gives
him a definitive view of the larger discussion that he's a part of.
It also enables him to contribute to the maintenance of that view,
which is the responsibility of the participants themselves.

&gt;<i> Manual tagging seems very clumsy when you're talking about
</I>&gt;<i> aggregating potentially large amounts of data in different formats,
</I>&gt;<i> but a bit of extra manual labor isn't necessarily a bad thing. After
</I>&gt;<i> all, the content of Wikipedia (including most inter-linkages) is all
</I>&gt;<i> basically hand-crafted. That human touch adds an editorial review
</I>&gt;<i> that full automation can't achieve.
</I>
I agree.  A dependence on labour needn't be a weakness in a social
practice; it can be a strength.  Suppose the facility presents the
larger discussion roughly like this: (thread titles are links)


    Ago     Forum      Thread title                  (issue Blah)
   -------  ---------  ------------------------------------------
   17 min   r/Blah     How do we attach the doohickey?

    5 hr    Blah-L     The problem with so and so's proposal.

    1 day   BlahBlah   This, that, and the next thing.

    1 day   r/Blah     What's all this blah about, anyway?

    2 days  BlahStack  What's the best thingamy for such and such?

            . . .      

This view is curated by the participants themselves.  Together they
decide its content.  If it's uncertain whether a given thread concerns
the issue of Blah, then they decide through elected officers, or by
whatever mechanism they've agreed to.  I think the crucial thing to
understand here is that together they hold the entire public
discussion of Blah in their hands.  As far as Blah is concerned, they
*are* the public.

&gt;<i> But I am also suggesting that you can impose tags from Votorola onto
</I>&gt;<i> any discussion. If each comment/post/email in any forum is
</I>&gt;<i> considered an independent object by Votorola (I'm assuming here),
</I>&gt;<i> then wouldn't it be fairly easy to allow each Votorola user add tags
</I>&gt;<i> to any object as they please?
</I>
Yes, I think so.  Except the use case requires that we deploy this
facility outside of Votorola.  It may already exist out there, at
least in part.  Basically I guess it's a kind of news feeder, but with
special features (plus the organization of labour and governance).

Anyway, I'm thinking the primary tag here is &quot;issue&quot;.  It's attached
to threads:

  thread1.issue = Blah
  thread2.issue = Blah, Foo

Multiple issues may be attached to a thread.  The Blah community
attaches only the Blah issue, and they alone attach it.  There may be
other formal issues that are Blah-like (even having the name &quot;Blah&quot;),
but the one that was originally formed by the community is under the
exclusive control of that community.  It cannot be taken from them.

The meaning of this facility still has me scratching my head.  It
seems to be bound up somewhere in these points:

  (a) It joins public discussion and self-governance to yield a
      strange and unexpected thing: the self-governance of a public
      discussion.

  (b) It joins them at a micro-scale that appears to be reachable by
      fumblers like us (the groping blind).

  (c) Our development work has been blocked for lack of these little
      proto-publics, which I've been calling &quot;discursive baselines&quot;.

  (d) Our ultimate aim is to join exactly the same two things (public
      discussion and self-governance) at a larger scale in society.


 * I've been exchanging emails off-list with Stephen Konieczka, and
   his pointed questions have helped me to clarify my thoughts.

Mike
