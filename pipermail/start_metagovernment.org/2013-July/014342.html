<PRE>Hi Ned,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These three forms of democracy can be distinguished:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     * Representative Democracy
</I>&gt;<i>     * Vote-Driven Direct Democracy
</I>&gt;<i>     * Discourse-Driven Direct Democracy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A cursory reading of the Ashland Food Co-op bylaws suggests that
</I>&gt;<i> currently the co-op is organized as a fairly standard polyarchy. The
</I>&gt;<i> membership votes on a few matters, the Board of Directors (BOD) acts as
</I>&gt;<i> the representative assembly, and the General Manager (GM) acts as the
</I>&gt;<i> chief executive. There is a little bit of vote-driven direct democracy
</I>&gt;<i> going on, but the BOD, the GM, and the various hierarchs below the GM
</I>&gt;<i> carry most of the weight of decision making. However (most thrillingly),
</I>&gt;<i> within the BOD deliberations (according to the &quot;emergency vote&quot; clause),
</I>&gt;<i> there is some discourse-driven decision making going on -- WooHoo!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The practices of the Votorola model are *vote-driven* direct democratic
</I>&gt;<i> practices, which are intended to &quot;influence&quot; (not replace, not control)
</I>&gt;<i> representative democracy forms (the BOD, the GM, etc.). The Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> model (so far as I have seen) contains no discourse-driven direct
</I>&gt;<i> democratic practices. (Various discourse practices are stuck on like
</I>&gt;<i> post-it notes at various spots, but play no formal role in decision
</I>&gt;<i> making.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       IMPLEMENTING DISCOURSE-DRIVEN DIRECT DEMOCRACY
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be possible for the co-op to set up a fully functional
</I>&gt;<i> discourse-driven direct democracy system, tomorrow. It could be set up
</I>&gt;<i> in a wiki (a networked set of wiki-pages). Wiki platforms are readily
</I>&gt;<i> available, and the new system could run parallel with the existing
</I>&gt;<i> systems, so that no initial changes to existing systems would be needed.
</I>&gt;<i> From that beginning, the new system could grow and evolve organically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The elements of the new practice might be these: (unless someone objected)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     * Anyone can propose, anything.
</I>&gt;<i>     * Each initial proposal goes into a new wiki-page.
</I>&gt;<i>     * Notification is sent to everyone who has expressed interest.
</I>&gt;<i>     * Objections (including reasons, perhaps including recommendations)
</I>&gt;<i>       are proposed (either into the original page, and/or into new pages
</I>&gt;<i>       and then cross-linked).
</I>&gt;<i>     * The discourse (through successive, recursive proposing) continues
</I>&gt;<i>       until there are no unresolved objections to the initial proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>     * At that point, the initial proposal has &quot;passed&quot;, and is ready to
</I>&gt;<i>       be implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this system of decision making, it does not matter how many people
</I>&gt;<i> are &quot;for&quot; the proposal, or how many people are &quot;against&quot; the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> It only matters that there are *no unresolved objections* standing
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;against&quot; the proposal. That is the fundamental difference between
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;vote-driven&quot; and &quot;discourse-driven&quot; decision making.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if you (Stephen) wished to get &quot;DDDD&quot; started within the co-op, you
</I>&gt;<i> could propose doing so to the membership, as outlined above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
You have seen that Votorola is basically bolted on a Sematic-Media-Wiki (it is 
our DB and at the heart of the architecture + even shared by the 
metagovernment.org wiki)? Every requirement outlined above is covered by 
prototype-software on <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/">http://zelea.com/w/</A> 
I admit that the homepage practices are distracting from this fact atm. 
because we have specified concrete possible practice applications for our new 
indirection feature in the delegational tree (pipes). Our problem so far has 
been the lack of real users, not the lack of implementing your/our 
requirements. I agree with you that the homepage is overwhelmingly complex as 
a result and we need to fix that.

But more generally you make up differences between &quot;vote-based&quot; and discourse 
based systems very quickly, because all Votorola does in the different 
practices is route assent and document it publicly. It is not per se a 
decision system or constructs indirect process, it does not calculate final 
results or determines winners. Generally speaking, every discourse system can 
result in decisions and every vote-counting system (e.g. boring quantitive 
ones) can spawn further public reflection. Discourse systems are of a very 
different quality though, because they give the user much more expressiveness 
and allow to find solutions by synthesis, as metagovernment has coined it with 
the dialectical term, and not the mechanism of the decision process. Votorola 
is designed with that at heart, the practices are only suggestions to help 
find common positions. Making a decision is easy once you build consensus. 
This is the hard part though ...
 
Our theoretically underlining practice is discussion and the soft force of 
better reasoning (to paraphrase Habermas' discourse theory, which we rely 
upon, see esp. the &quot;patch relaying&quot; practice). It is not meant as a voting 
tool in the way you see it to complement some party process or abstract 
arguments away with mechanical mathematical formula to calculate decisions or 
outcomes. All you do is mark your current preference (or stick to yourself) 
and use the collectively (publicly) gathered information to foster the 
discussion and push your perspective further, the core of the process is 
mutual *text* patching and referencing.

Regarding your proposal, even just setting up a Wiki (not adjusting or 
developping new software) is significant admin work and without a defined 
need, especially off-site, highly likely to fail (ask Ed or Mike about the 
overhead). I propose to wait for more information/clarification from Stephen 
before we argue about design sketches. I don't think we are at odds unless we 
start to fight over ideas prematurely.

P.S.: Sent again, came back yesterday from a Spam blacklist on chello.at .
