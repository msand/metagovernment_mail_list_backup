<PRE>Hi Mike,

    Mike&gt; Primary guidance and authoritative decision. These are two
    categories of system, each with a different purpose. The purpose of
    the first is to guide the second. Discourse belongs to the first. 

I understand that a population could choose to have these two separate 
systems, related as you suggest. Do you understand that a population 
could choose *not* to have these two separate systems, but rather to 
have only an authoritative decision system, without a primary guidance 
system?

If you do understand this, then you also understand that you need to 
make a case for having the two separate systems -- you cannot simply 
assume that there will be two separate systems, as if that were the only 
possible way to arrange things.

Would it be possible for you to briefly list the reasons that you think 
the two-system arrangement is better than a single-system arrangement? 
(If you have read books that give reasons, kindly distill those reasons 
into a list, thereby revealing the benefit that you received from 
reading those books -- you now know the reasons.)
