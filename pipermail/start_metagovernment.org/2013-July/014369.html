<PRE>Hi Ned,

I answer both questions here, because they are related.

&gt;<i> I understand that a population could choose to have these two
</I>&gt;<i> separate systems, related as you suggest. Do you understand that a
</I>&gt;<i> population could choose *not* to have these two separate systems,
</I>&gt;<i> but rather to have only an authoritative decision system, without a
</I>&gt;<i> primary guidance system?
</I>
Yes, if the decisions are reached by sortition.  Sortition decisions
cannot usefully be guided or otherwise influenced.  Guidance is only
useful when the decisions are a matter of choice (voting).  Then the
deciders will want to know what choice to make.  The source of their
knowledge is what I call &quot;primary guidance&quot;.

&gt;<i> Would it be possible for you to briefly list the reasons that you
</I>&gt;<i> think the two-system arrangement is better than a single-system
</I>&gt;<i> arrangement?
</I>
Consider the case in which primary guidance (knowing what choice to
make) is based on reason.  By contrast, recall that decisions are
based on force (the essence of their decisiveness).  Now the problem
arises that reason and force are incompatible; the two must be kept
apart.  So we have separate systems each dedicated to its own
function, then bring them into proper relation with each other:

  (reason and knowledge) --&gt; (force and decision)

These two cannot be combined without destroying one, or the other.
Anyway, this is my own understanding.

&gt;<i> I am having trouble understanding the desirability of discussions
</I>&gt;<i> that go on and on.  ...  The &quot;product&quot; of a decision system is
</I>&gt;<i> decisions made. The product of a &quot;guidance system&quot; is decisions
</I>&gt;<i> guided. One primary aim of such systems (I would have thought) is to
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate coming to agreement, as quickly and efficiently as
</I>&gt;<i> possible. ...  Mike, do you think that quickness and efficiency
</I>&gt;<i> don't matter?
</I>
I think it matters for both system types, but to different ends.  A
decision system should be efficient in regard to forming decisions,
while a guidance system should be efficient in regard to forming
knowledge (or what not).  The crucial thing to avoid is systematically
interlinking the two, e.g. by forcing the guidance processes to dance
to the decision-making drum.

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; Primary guidance and authoritative decision. These are two
</I>&gt;<i>     categories of system, each with a different purpose. The purpose of
</I>&gt;<i>     the first is to guide the second. Discourse belongs to the first. 
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you do understand this, then you also understand that you need to 
</I>&gt;<i> make a case for having the two separate systems -- you cannot simply 
</I>&gt;<i> assume that there will be two separate systems, as if that were the only 
</I>&gt;<i> possible way to arrange things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be possible for you to briefly list the reasons that you think

Ned Conner (Discursive Baseline) said:
&gt;<i> Hi Marc and Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; A discursive baseline is a minimal level of discussion that is
</I>&gt;<i>     sustained as a developmental reference. It is the &quot;lump of clay&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     held by the discourse practitioner to which she gives shape, against
</I>&gt;<i>     which she judges the potential and progress of her work, and tests
</I>&gt;<i>     the need and efficacy of her tools. It is a discussion with the
</I>&gt;<i>     following properties: (a) long lived, so the clay stays in the hands
</I>&gt;<i>     of the practitioner; (b) focused on the issue of an action norm,
</I>&gt;<i>     because such norms strongly depend on discursive validation; and (c)
</I>&gt;<i>     public, because only those affected by the action can rightly
</I>&gt;<i>     validate it. These properties, plus any formal supports that are
</I>&gt;<i>     needed to sustain them, comprise the discursive baseline. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am having trouble understanding the desirability of discussions that 
</I>&gt;<i> go on and on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;product&quot; of a decision system is decisions made. The product of a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;guidance system&quot; is decisions guided. One primary aim of such systems 
</I>&gt;<i> (I would have thought) is to facilitate coming to agreement, as quickly 
</I>&gt;<i> and efficiently as possible. The tools and practices succeed to the 
</I>&gt;<i> extent that they serve that aim (among others). Even a guidance system 
</I>&gt;<i> needs to answer to practical considerations such as quickness and 
</I>&gt;<i> efficiency.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are plenty of action norms to be set. It is not as if actually 
</I>&gt;<i> succeeding in reaching agreement with respect to any particular norm is 
</I>&gt;<i> going to put us out of business.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mike, do you think that quickness and efficiency don't matter?
</I>
