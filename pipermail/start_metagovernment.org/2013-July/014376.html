It's always a pleasure. ;^)

</I>&gt;<i> wasteful, and distracting.
</I>
The need is to inform the deciders of what the decision ought to be.
Do the deciders already have this knowledge on your &quot;planet&quot;, as you
put it?

Seriously, I need to know before I can answer further.

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, a brief preamble:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mike, I greatly appreciate you ability to &quot;stay with it&quot; in these 
</I>&gt;<i> discussions, even when I am sure you are sometimes feeling just as 
</I>&gt;<i> frustrated as I am. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are both english speakers, but we are so far out on the edge of the 
</I>&gt;<i> newly possible that standard english hasn't got there yet. In this 
</I>&gt;<i> thread (I now see), we are going to be dealing with those kinds of 
</I>&gt;<i> issues, which will compound the difficulty of trying to discuss some 
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental differences in perspective and objective. Fastening 
</I>&gt;<i> seatbelts at this point would be appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Votorola is trying to systematize &quot;primary guidance&quot;, as something 
</I>&gt;<i> separate from and applied to &quot;authoritative decision&quot;. I will now 
</I>&gt;<i> contend (provisionally, as a &quot;poking with ten foot pole&quot; move) that 
</I>&gt;<i> guidance should not be systematized.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Systematizing guidance creates a *SYSTEM*. It would be better for 
</I>&gt;<i> guidance to spring directly from the (unsystematized) lifeworld, and be 
</I>&gt;<i> applied through the direct participation of individuals of the general 
</I>&gt;<i> public in authoritative decision making.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; Primary guidance and authoritative decision. These are two
</I>&gt;<i>     categories of system, each with a different purpose. The purpose of
</I>&gt;<i>     the first is to guide the second. Discourse belongs to the first. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I would say that we would be much better off if authoritative 
</I>&gt;<i> decisions were made through discourse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; And I would say that we don't need a separate primary guidance 
</I>&gt;<i> system. To have such a system would be unnecessary, expensive, wasteful, 
</I>&gt;<i> and distracting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; But there are alternatives, and I think you want to say,
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;Primary guidance should be effected by discourse and the unforced
</I>&gt;<i>     force of reason, not by mass manipulation, money and power.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I want to say is: &quot;Authoritative decisions should be effected by 
</I>&gt;<i> discourse and the unforced force of reason, not by mass manipulation, 
</I>&gt;<i> money, and power. Primary guidance of deciders should be effected 
</I>&gt;<i> through the (unsystematized) lifeworld.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I understand that a population could choose to have these two
</I>&gt;<i>     separate systems, related as you suggest. Do you understand that a
</I>&gt;<i>     population could choose *not* to have these two separate systems,
</I>&gt;<i>     but rather to have only an authoritative decision making system,
</I>&gt;<i>     without a primary guidance system?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt;Yes, if the decisions are reached by sortition. Sortition
</I>&gt;<i>     decisions cannot usefully be guided or otherwise influenced.
</I>&gt;<i>     Guidance is only useful when the decisions are a matter of choice
</I>&gt;<i>     (voting). Then the deciders will want to know what choice to make.
</I>&gt;<i>     The source of their knowledge is what I call &quot;primary guidance&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Mike, that to me is an amazing paragraph. Wow. Not only are we not 
</I>&gt;<i> on the same page, we are not on the same planet. (I am saying this not 
</I>&gt;<i> to disparage but to emphasize -- the scale of our differences is 
</I>&gt;<i> remarkable.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; That you should think that the only way to dispense with the 
</I>&gt;<i> primary guidance system would be for authoritative decisions to be made 
</I>&gt;<i> by sortition -- I am having trouble wrapping my head around that. So is 
</I>&gt;<i> it your position that, /a priori/, direct democracy is not only not 
</I>&gt;<i> possible, but not even conceivable?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; On my planet (which is definitely conceivable), &quot;the deciders&quot; are 
</I>&gt;<i> the general public. Each individual decider in the population has his or 
</I>&gt;<i> her own &quot;primary guidance&quot;, from within and from without. There is no 
</I>&gt;<i> single systematized source for that primary guidance. Following that 
</I>&gt;<i> guidance, each individual decider is free to participate in making any 
</I>&gt;<i> authoritative decision, on equal footing. Participation occurs through 
</I>&gt;<i> discourse. The authoritative decision is reached through discourse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; On your planet, it sounds like the distinction between governors 
</I>&gt;<i> and governed is cast in concrete. I would recommend that you consider 
</I>&gt;<i> moving to my planet. My planet has a lot more flowers, on account of 
</I>&gt;<i> having fewer bomb craters and toxic waste dumps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Would it be possible for you to briefly list the reasons that
</I>&gt;<i>     you think the two-system arrangement is better than a single-system
</I>&gt;<i>     arrangement?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; Consider the case in which primary guidance (knowing what
</I>&gt;<i>     choice to make) is based on reason. By contrast, recall that
</I>&gt;<i>     decisions are based on force (the essence of their decisiveness).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; You ask me to recall that decisions are based on force. I honestly 
</I>&gt;<i> have no idea what you are talking about here. I have no such recollection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I understand that, once an authoritative decision has been made, 
</I>&gt;<i> force might be used in implementing the decision. But the making of the 
</I>&gt;<i> authoritative decision need not involve force, and in a discourse-driven 
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy never would involve force.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; About the only circumstance that comes to mind in which *making* an 
</I>&gt;<i> authoritative decision would involve force would be the Godfather Movie 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Your brains or your signature will appear on this paper&quot; sort of 
</I>&gt;<i> circumstance. Having a separate &quot;primary guidance&quot; system would do 
</I>&gt;<i> nothing to forestall that sort of occurrence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; Now the problem arises that reason and force are incompatible;
</I>&gt;<i>     the two must be kept apart. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Wait ... What? No!
</I>&gt;<i> Not only are force and reason not incompatible, we always *want* force 
</I>&gt;<i> to be reasonable. Can you provide further elaboration of what underlies 
</I>&gt;<i> this (to me) very odd view that the two are incompatible?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; So we have separate systems each dedicated to its own
</I>&gt;<i>     function, then bring them into proper relation with each other:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         (reason and knowledge) --&gt; (force and decision)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     These two cannot be combined without destroying one, or the other.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Again, we are on different planets. We are so far apart I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> even know what questions to ask ... :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I would cast the proper relation as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     (reason and knowledge) --&gt; (decision) --&gt; (reason and knowledge and
</I>&gt;<i>     force) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; You say the two systems cannot be combined without destroying one, 
</I>&gt;<i> or the other. Would it be possible for you to describe the 
</I>&gt;<i> nature/mechanisms of the destruction(s), and the results of the 
</I>&gt;<i> destruction? (If you could give examples, that would be really great.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; The crucial thing to avoid is systematically interlinking the
</I>&gt;<i>     two, e.g. by forcing the guidance processes to dance to the
</I>&gt;<i>     decision-making drum. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Can you discuss what it would be like for the guidance processes to 
</I>&gt;<i> dance to the decision-making drum? (If you could come up with some 
</I>&gt;<i> examples of that happening, that would be great.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; For me, this has been a safari to a very foreign land -- great stuff!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
