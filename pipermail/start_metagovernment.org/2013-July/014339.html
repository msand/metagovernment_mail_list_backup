<PRE>Hi Conseo and Stephen,

Stephen, obviously to all you are the sort of user/visionary that e-dem 
designers and developers dream of working with.

Conseo, Stephen has just given you feedback, with which I heartily 
concur: the Votorola main page to which you linked is mostly 
incomprehensible. It cannot be used as part of a proposal to the Ashland 
Food Co-op. (Maybe you could write up &quot;elevator pitches&quot; for one or more 
of the practices?)

Conseo, how close is your team to putting up a fully functional practice 
(any practice), that Stephen (and the rest of us) could actually engage 
in? The actual experience of engaging in the practice might then enable 
him to write up a proposal of the practice that would be comprehensible 
and persuasive to his audience.

Stephen, in order to enable Conseo to &quot;diagnose&quot; which of his practices 
might be useful to the co-op, it would be helpful if you could present 
an analysis of existing democratic practices within the co-op. Here is a 
start:

    * The 8000 members vote on bylaws.
    * The 8000 members elect board members.
    * The 8000 members choose the grants committee members?
    * The General Manager is hired by the BOD?
    * The Board of Directors decide ...
    * The General Manager decides ...
    * The Grants Committee decides ...
    * ...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I should have said is this, &quot;whenever I try to understand the

</I>&gt;<i> that's my experience when I look at the Votorola page on 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Practices&quot;...for instance. I /love/ the diagrams as they really help

</I>&gt;<i> I read the /text/ about &quot;containment, variation, account sinking, free 
</I>&gt;<i> flying&quot;, etc. I get stupid really fast. I /want/ to understand all of 
</I>&gt;<i> that....but so many of the concepts are /so/ foreign to me, I just 
</I>&gt;<i> about can't read a paragraph without landing on my face.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I regret the comment I made as it was a rude thing to say....and 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just now seeing what underpinned it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel like someone from the 1950's who has just been given an iPad 
</I>&gt;<i> and told to 'go surf the net'. On a theoretical level I really get 
</I>&gt;<i> what you guys are doing....and I have the utmost respect towards you 
</I>&gt;<i> for even /imagining/ these new forms of collaboration. I want to be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to work with you in some way. But I feel pretty dumb-ass (here), 
</I>&gt;<i> most of the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm actually not a stupid man though. And I think a fairly large 
</I>&gt;<i> percentage of the human population (your constituency) would feel 
</I>&gt;<i> similarly if they came upon these same concepts and language-ings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My sense is that someone from the fifties would need to begin with a 
</I>&gt;<i> simple cordless phone in order to not be completely overwhelmed.&quot; Wow, 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't need a /wire/, /unbelievable/&quot;. I remember watching star trek 
</I>&gt;<i> when it first came out thinking their wireless communication devices 
</I>&gt;<i> were, like, from another /planet/.
</I>&gt;<i> ,
</I>&gt;<i> From where most people are today.... e-Democracy is a very 
</I>&gt;<i> 'futuristic' concept. I shared some of the Votarola pages (which I 
</I>&gt;<i> think are awesome BTW) with my brother a while back thinking I would 
</I>&gt;<i> be able to impress him with the whole concept of e-D. His response was 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;let me know when you guys are done playing in the sandbox&quot;. He was 
</I>&gt;<i> /sooo/ /not/ /interested/....and he's a very politically guy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I've said recently, I live in a fairly progressive town. When I 
</I>&gt;<i> talk to my friends about &quot;this bunch of guys (I think you are all 
</I>&gt;<i> guys), who are actually writing code for a totally awesome system of 
</I>&gt;<i> global collaboration&quot;.... they kind of go &quot;huh?...oh cool&quot;....end of 
</I>&gt;<i> conversation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To get even a modest percentage of the human population interested in 
</I>&gt;<i> switching to /such/ a radically complex framework of self-governance 
</I>&gt;<i> is going to be an /enormous/ task. Unless it can be made to appeal 
</I>&gt;<i> greatly to other parts of the human psyche, I'm just not seeing it 
</I>&gt;<i> before we all turn to toast.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No... let me say it this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like most Americans, I sit down one or two times a year and read my 
</I>&gt;<i> voters handbook, and after a little deliberation and discussion among 
</I>&gt;<i> some friends and my partner, I start filling in circles with a pencil. 
</I>&gt;<i> This system is the rotary-dial-up-method of governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you are asking (normal) people to comprehend in the concept of 
</I>&gt;<i> *Meta-governance* is an 'internet' of complexity relative to what is 
</I>&gt;<i> familiar and comfortable to them. Most people just aren't going to go 
</I>&gt;<i> there unless you can dress it up a bit, make it a little simpler, and 
</I>&gt;<i> pleeeez,,,, make it a little more fun.....even then.....?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK...I'll shut up after this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think people will need to begin somewhere south of 'Patch relaying' 
</I>&gt;<i> and 'Position space rationalization' if we are ever going to 'see the 
</I>&gt;<i> light of dawn'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ..........................................
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does any of that make sense....or am I totally in the nut tree?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not in /any/ way intending this to be a 'dis' because I absolutely 
</I>&gt;<i> /love/ what you all are doing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I really want to be able to use these tools...../really/ /soon/.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With utmost sincerity,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steve
