<PRE>&gt;<i> Great response from the BOD! So, there we have it. The board has

</I>
A vote restricted to an elite is still a vote.  Ultimately you can
restrict the vote to a single person, but it still remains a vote.
The tighter the exclusions, the greater becomes the power of the elite
and the greater the need for silence among those excluded.

&gt;<i> Hi Stephen,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great response from the BOD! So, there we have it. The board has been 
</I>&gt;<i> successfully using discourse-driven decision making, without voting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now the question becomes (for me), would the membership be interested in 
</I>&gt;<i> undertaking the experiment of trying to use discourse-driven decision 
</I>&gt;<i> making at the scale of the entire co-op? (Perhaps beginning with the 
</I>&gt;<i> parking problem ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would move the practice from the &quot;team&quot; scale (the BOD), through 
</I>&gt;<i> the community scale (150 or less), to the scale of a small population 
</I>&gt;<i> (8,000). To demonstrate that discourse-driven decision making could 
</I>&gt;<i> successfully work at that scale would be a big deal. It would provide 
</I>&gt;<i> evidence that voting may not be the only possible basis for democracy, 
</I>&gt;<i> even at the scale of populations.
