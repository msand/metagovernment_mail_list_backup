<PRE>Hi Mike,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; Great response from the BOD! So, there we have it. The board
    has been successfully using discourse-driven decision making,
    without voting.

    Mike&gt; A vote restricted to an elite is still a vote. Ultimately you
    can restrict the vote to a single person, but it still remains a
    vote. The tighter the exclusions, the greater becomes the power of
    the elite and the greater the need for silence among those excluded.

    Ned&gt; Mike, you lost me on that last turn. Would it be possible for
    you to elaborate your meaning a bit? I am having trouble figuring
    out how to apply what you have said to what I said and/or to what
    Gwyneth Bowman said.

    Mike&gt; I was referring to these last two words of yours [&quot;without
    voting&quot;]. I think the board is indeed voting. Generally all of
    society's decision systems are based on voting (formal choice),
    except those based on sortition, which are quite rare.

Ned&gt; It would appear that we have some work to do to get our 
terminologies on the same page. You appear to have defined &quot;to vote&quot; as 
&quot;to make a formal choice&quot;. Whenever a person makes a formal choice, 
using any means of expression, in any context, having any sort of 
effect, the person has voted. (Yes?)

I have been using the terms &quot;vote-driven&quot; and &quot;discourse-driven&quot; to 
distinguish two different methods of decision making. You now appear to 
be saying that, by your definition of  &quot;to vote&quot;, both of these methods 
involve voting.

So, you tell me: what terms shall we use to distinguish these two 
different methods of decision making?
