<PRE>Hi Stephen,

Great response from the BOD! So, there we have it. The board has been 
successfully using discourse-driven decision making, without voting.

Now the question becomes (for me), would the membership be interested in 
undertaking the experiment of trying to use discourse-driven decision 
making at the scale of the entire co-op? (Perhaps beginning with the 
parking problem ...)

This would move the practice from the &quot;team&quot; scale (the BOD), through 
the community scale (150 or less), to the scale of a small population 
(8,000). To demonstrate that discourse-driven decision making could 
successfully work at that scale would be a big deal. It would provide 
evidence that voting may not be the only possible basis for democracy, 
even at the scale of populations.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> July 10, 2013
</I>&gt;<i> Dear Mr. Coffman,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your email of July 9, 2013.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been on the Board of Directors for nine years and have never 
</I>&gt;<i> experienced a vote of the Directors when we needed to use the 2/3&#8217;s 
</I>&gt;<i> majority vote option. On a few occasions we have had a member &#8220;stand 
</I>&gt;<i> aside&#8221; over an issue that they might not personally agree with, but 
</I>&gt;<i> didn&#8217;t feel it was an important enough issue to block the vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -/Are there any particular issues/situations that have repeatedly 
</I>&gt;<i> triggered the use of the 2/3&#8217;s majority &#8220;emergency vote&#8221; clause?/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -There are none that I know of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /-Could you briefly describe the outcomes that followed decisions made by/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> / a 2/3&#8217;s majority vote?/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -This is not applicable, as there has not been use of the 2/3&#8217;s 
</I>&gt;<i> majority &#8220;emergency vote&#8221; clause.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /-Also, if you care to offer any further insights into this aspect of 
</I>&gt;<i> your decision making process, that would be most appreciated./
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Several thoughts that I have that might be helpful include the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     1.  We have a policy and procedure on Consensual Decision Making 
</I>&gt;<i> that we review.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     2.  Every year we have Board of Director elections.  If a new 
</I>&gt;<i> Director is voted in, we have an orientation for that new Director of 
</I>&gt;<i> all Policies and Procedures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     3.  When an item is placed on the agenda or the Consent Agenda 
</I>&gt;<i> each Board Director is responsible for reviewing the issue.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> Director who places it on the agenda is the Sponsor of the item.  Any 
</I>&gt;<i> Director who has concerns should contact that person for 
</I>&gt;<i> clarification.  If the concern is not clarified satisfactorily, it is 
</I>&gt;<i> pulled from the Consent Agenda so there can be a full discussion. 
</I>&gt;<i>  Sometimes, if there is not adequate time for discussion, it will be 
</I>&gt;<i> placed on the following month&#8217;s agenda.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      4. One important fact that we learned is there is rarely an issue 
</I>&gt;<i> that we need to vote on that is a crisis or emergency.  Thus, it is 
</I>&gt;<i> prudent to take enough time to get additional information to add to 
</I>&gt;<i> the discussion until everyone is reasonably comfortable with it. 
</I>&gt;<i> This could mean     we could reschedule it to a future meeting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      5. We also use a professional facilitator in our discussions, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is very helpful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      6.  One issue that I personally find helpful is a discussion 
</I>&gt;<i> regarding the different communication style of different Directors. 
</I>&gt;<i>  Some of us are extroverts others of us are introverts.  Extroverts 
</I>&gt;<i> often think quickly and &quot;loudly&quot; and want to come to a quick decision 
</I>&gt;<i> and not let process happen. Introverts often need more time to ponder 
</I>&gt;<i> the issue and to formulate their responses.  A superior decision is 
</I>&gt;<i> made when all Directors have adequate time to process the information 
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of their communication style.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       7. I am not pretending that our process is always smooth. 
</I>&gt;<i>  Conflict can be healthy as long as we make sure we go through 
</I>&gt;<i> conflict resolution that is critical for our ability to meet the many 
</I>&gt;<i> needs of our owners and Co-op.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gwyneth Bowman, AFC Board of Directors President

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Dear Ashland Co-op Board members,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I live in Ashland and have been a Co-op member for 25+ years.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I'm associated with a small group of e-Democracy theorists and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     software developers who are designing and building toolsets +
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     platforms + processes for a new, and hopefully, more evolved
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     democracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Because the Co-op has been so successful over the years, some of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     us would like to inquire into a certain aspect of the Board of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Directors decision making process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     There is currently a discussion in our forum with respect to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     merit of *voting* vs. engaging in *rational discourse* until a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     consensus can be reached.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     In the Co-op By-laws (section 5.5) use of a 2/3's majority
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *emergency vote* is permitted if &quot;diligent efforts have failed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     produce a consensus and the issue requires immediate action...&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Regarding this *emergency vote* clause, we are curious to find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     answers to the following questions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - How often does the Co-op BOD find itself in a position where it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     is unable to &quot;reconcile differing points of view based on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     best interests of the Co-op&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - Are there any particular issues/situations that have repeatedly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     triggered the use of the 2/3's majority *emergency vote* clause?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - Could you briefly describe the outcomes that followed decisions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     made by a 2/3's majority vote?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Also, if you care to offer any further insights into this aspect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     of your decision making process, that would be most appreciated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Thank you so much,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
