<PRE>Hi Pietro,

The AG MFT is a very small working group inside the Pirate Party Germany. As 
a real grassroot initiative, we don't have any big supporters yet. So our 
range of influence is in fact currently limited. BUT, we are growing and 
more and more people becoming interested in what we are doing.

IMHO its always a long and hard way to start-up things from the roots. 
Therefore any help is appreciated to get widely known - even in Italy ;o)

Cheers
marc

P.S.: Pietro, maybe you experienced by yourself that our kind of thinking a 
new way of (e-)democracy is more the longterm alternative, whereas the most 
political activists are more short term oriented. IMHO this conflict is hard 
to overcome... otherwise Vilfredo should have ruled the world already ;o)

Hi, looking forward to this.

I thought you have dismembered.

Also I am quite perplexed because I have spoken to several people of the 
Pirate Party in Italy about your initiative, and no one knew nothing about 
it. Even Carl Von Lynx, who is half Italian and half German and a member of 
both PP did not know about it.

How many people know about it?


Cheers,
Pietro
