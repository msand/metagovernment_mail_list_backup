<PRE>Hi Mike and Ed, (Great Responses -- much appreciated!)

So Mike, if a proposal constitutes a vote, is it also true that pretty 
much any speech act of rational discourse constitutes a vote of some kind?

If proposals constitute votes, then discourse always has voting built 
into it, so that discourse can be decisive. Am I missing something?

If we add Ed's (to me) clearly valid suggestion (that the spectators of 
a discourse, if they are free to participate, are voting when they do 
not participate), then again, public discourse always has voting built 
into it, and can be decisive. Again, am I missing something? Why would 
you assert that discourse cannot be decisive, if discourse has voting 
intrinsically embedded in it?

If we use your definition of voting, and if voting is, as you suggest, 
built into discourse, then the distinction I have been trying to express 
perhaps becomes that between &quot;naked voting&quot; (votes cast outside of 
discourse) and &quot;discourse voting&quot; (votes cast through discourse). 
Votorola uses &quot;naked voting&quot;. Blinap uses only &quot;discourse voting&quot;.

My contention is that we would be better off to use only discourse 
voting in our (decisive) public decision systems, in order to bring to 
bear upon democratic decision making the values of discourse that 
Habermas talks about. Naked voting does not bring those values to bear.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You have asserted that voting is a form of decision making, and that discourse is not a form of decision making, because it cannot be decisive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Consider the following sequence of events:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   1. A proposer proposes a proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   2. Notification of the proposal is sent to millions of members.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   3. The proposal successfully passes through all existing and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      applicable &quot;proposal criteria filters&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   4. No one proposes any objections to implementing the proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   5. The proposal is implemented.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This sequence of events has been decisive. If, as you say, discourse cannot be decisive, then voting (or sortition) must have been involved. So, please: show me the votes.
