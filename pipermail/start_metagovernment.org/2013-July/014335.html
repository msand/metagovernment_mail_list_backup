&gt;<i> It looks like the IRS demands that a nonprofit company have a board of directors. And I would really like to avoid that, because I want the nonprofit company to be a model for other nonprofits to adopt collaborative governance. But we might have to compromise in order to get the application approved, and just push against the boundaries of what the US tax code will permit as opportunity allows.

I was for several years the president of a local non-profit. I believe the minimum requirement for our board to meet was once a year. 
I don't see why an entity couldn't set up a sort of 'puppet board' that just gave a seasonal (even yearly) report in which it essentially 'rubber stamped' the business of the larger organization. 
Or it could be that the individuals selected by the organization to manage specific functions (like keeping track of the database and the finances) could be the board members in title only...and the meetings would simply consist of their reports on the 'business' of the entity. I don't think this would necessarily be that big of an issue.

Is it possible that the formation of these bylaws could be a &quot;baseline&quot; for developing the tools and practices?
