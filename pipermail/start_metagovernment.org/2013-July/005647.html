<PRE>What follows is a first draft of proposed bylaws for &quot;an organization to 
serve us&quot;. This would be the global metagovernment (I have called it a 
&quot;society&quot;) that would drive all of the various national foundations and 
such around the world.

The draft also exists as a wiki-page:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Society_Bylaws">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Society_Bylaws</A>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1. *MEMBERSHIP: UNCOERCED*

      Any sentient being (globally) may freely choose to become a member
      of the society. Any member may freely choose to cease to be a
      member of the society.

   2. *DECISION MAKING: DIRECT DEMOCRACY*

      Each member of the society is free to participate in making any
      decision that the society makes. Each member participates in
      decision making on equal footing.

      (Emergency decisions are made through a subordinate emergency
      response system. Any member may participate in the post-emergency
      reviews of decisions made during emergencies.)

   3. *PARTICIPATION: THROUGH PROPOSING*

      Members participate in decision making exclusively through
      formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
      ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
      provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
      making.

   4. *DECISION RULE: NO UNRESOLVED OBJECTIONS
      *

      The decision rule is that a proposal is cleared to be implemented
      at the point that it faces no unresolved objections. Objections
      are proposed. Objections are resolved through successive,
      recursive proposing.

   5. *NOTIFICATION: PROPOSAL PROFILES, PROPOSAL MAGNETS*

      Effecting direct democracy at the scale of the global population
      requires that the decision system have an affordable sub-system
      that reliably notifies each member of new proposals that may be of
      interest, and that avoids inundating individuals with new
      proposals not of interest. The details of the software and
      practices that will together effect efficient and reliable global
      notification will be co-created and evolved through successive
      successful proposing.

   6. *APPLYING PAST DECISIONS: APPRAISAL*

      In order for the decision system to be affordable and reliable at
      the scale of the global population, it must have a sub-system that
      efficiently and reliably applies all relevant past decisions to
      each new proposal that is submitted. (The past decisions serve as
      filters; each new proposal must successfully &quot;pass through&quot; all
      such filters in order to be cleared for implementation.) The
      details of the software and practices that will together effect
      this will be co-created and evolved through successive successful
      proposing.

   7. *AMENDMENTS: THROUGH PROPOSING*

      Additions and amendments to these bylaws may be effected through
      successfully proposing.
