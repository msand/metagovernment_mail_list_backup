Whoops, sorry.  That was the dev wiki.  Try here:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/glossary">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/glossary</A>

&gt;<i> Attaching the voter's name to a vote does not clothe the vote from
</I>&gt;<i> the perspective of rational discourse. The vote -- with or without
</I>&gt;<i> the voter's name attached -- cannot be challenged through discourse
</I>&gt;<i> unless the reasons for the vote are given, or at least promised. ...
</I>
The identity of the person is attached, not the name.  The identity
tells you who the person is.  You may then talk to him (in private or
public) and challenge the rationality of his position.  This gives you
a real argument in the real world with real people.  And it generates
real knowledge, which is the purpose of Votorola.

Reasons are *always* promised in public communications, at least
according to the theory I follow (Communicative Action).

&gt;<i> All of the votes that are called votes in the Votorola documentation
</I>&gt;<i> appear to me to be naked votes. If all participation occurred
</I>&gt;<i> through proposing positions, then all Votorola votes would be
</I>&gt;<i> clothed. (I guess I should ask directly: Do you agree that Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> does use naked voting?)
</I>
I offered two examples of clothing: personal identity and position
drafts.  There are others, but I think these two are substantial
enough to defend against the critique of naked voting.

You seem to have eyes only for formal argumentation.  But if that's
your definition of clothing, then it's not generally useful because
formal argumentation itself has not been shown to be generally useful;
certainly not on its own, and probably not in combination either.
It's an unproven technology.


Let's give our discussions a rest.  The topics are interesting and
it's a pleasure to spar with you because you respect the rules, but
the audience is too sparse to justify the effort.  If you still want
discussions, then please reconsider the offer you've rejected.

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Attaching the voter's name to a vote does not clothe the vote from the 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective of rational discourse. The vote -- with or without the 
</I>&gt;<i> voter's name attached -- cannot be challenged through discourse unless 
</I>&gt;<i> the reasons for the vote are given, or at least promised. A &quot;position&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> is indeed a fully clothed vote.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All of the votes that are called votes in the Votorola documentation 
</I>&gt;<i> appear to me to be naked votes. If all participation occurred through 
</I>&gt;<i> proposing positions, then all Votorola votes would be clothed. (I guess 
</I>&gt;<i> I should ask directly: Do you agree that Votorola does use naked voting?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My contention (my proposal, my position) is that we will be better off 
</I>&gt;<i> if we entirely abandon the use of naked voting, and instead arrive at 
</I>&gt;<i> decisions (including the un-decisions of &quot;guidance&quot;) through successive 
</I>&gt;<i> and recursive proposing (that is, through discourse).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Throughout history, all sustained attempts to effect democracy through 
</I>&gt;<i> the use of naked voting have gone not so well. What leads you to think 
</I>&gt;<i> that the use of naked voting in Votorola will buck that trend?
