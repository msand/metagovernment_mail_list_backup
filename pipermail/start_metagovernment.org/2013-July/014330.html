I want to interject a few more thoughts here. 

The Ashland Food Co-op is directly associated with 2 other co-ops here in S. Oregon....one of which is a Credit Union. The other is a farm and garden 'Grange' cooperative. Both the Food Co-op and the Grange Co-op are directly affiliated with their respective *national* associations....perhaps the Credit union is as well. So that could potentially make the next step in scaling a little easier.

Also, from my perspective, the Food Co-op would be an ideal place to begin because it has a fairly active member base that is already working on a variety of very progressive issues. If we could develop what is already existing into a coherent, self-organizing system with a foundation to resource itself...I think it would be a very attractive and powerful model for scaling through the Co-op's various (above mentioned) associations.

And finally, the community of Ashland is fairly homogeneous in terms of it's progressive orientation. It's kind of a bubble here that way. In other words, there isn't the degree of polarity here that exists socially, politically, and environmentally in other realms. I'm not in anyway saying I think this would be a slam dunk. I just think it would be a more 'user friendly' place to begin.
