<PRE>Hi Steve,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This *proposal* is intended to gather approval and support for organizing a
</I>&gt;<i> web-based *Community Network* within the membership of the Ashland Food
</I>&gt;<i> Co-op (AFC) located in Ashland, Oregon, USA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The purpose of this Community Network is to encourage any and all AFC
</I>&gt;<i> member(s) to develop *proposals* that are oriented toward building and
</I>&gt;<i> sustaining a vibrant local community, and then to submit their proposals to
</I>&gt;<i> the Co-op membership for collaboration, funding, and support.
</I>Ok, this is pretty generic and clear so far.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All proposals submitted to this Community Network would need to fit within
</I>&gt;<i> certain (TBD) *categories and criteria*.
</I>Why? If you try to assess risks or problems of certain proposals, then better 
pin them down first and let us tackle them one by one and only wire them with 
the system together in the end. I will recur on this in the following 
paragraphs. Maybe you can try to boil it down a bit more? But I like where it 
is going.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These (TBD) proposal *categories* could include items such as: local organic
</I>&gt;<i> farming and gardening; stewarding the watershed/bioregion; community health
</I>&gt;<i> and well-being; caring for the homeless; sustainable energy and transport;
</I>&gt;<i> community networking; local currency; green building; etc.
</I>Yes, and basically whatever the community (beyond the coop) can come up with. 
Raising a proposal should be as generic and simple as possible to generate the 
necessary reach to become attractive.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These (TBD) proposal *criteria* could include items such as: must follow the
</I>&gt;<i> precautionary principle, must be open and transparent, must be community
</I>&gt;<i> based and focussed, must have a clear outline for development, must have an
</I>&gt;<i> explicit budget for any funds requested, etc.
</I>Why? Adding constraints doesn't make it easier but potentially more 
complicated. There might be good reasons, yet I don't see them yet. Non-sense 
or evil proposals should be covered by the process itself (people arguing). 
Maybe you can illustrate the problem from the perspective of a stakeholder in 
form of a story-card/scenario for me to better understand which problems we 
are hedging against. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Proposals would go through a process of *appraisal* to see if they fit these
</I>&gt;<i> *criteria and category* constraints. If and when they pass appraisal they
</I>&gt;<i> would be *tagged* and posted online.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *Appraisers* would be elected and trained by the Community Network.
</I>You mean the audience/users of the tool? I agree. But ideally training should 
be little and done as needed (and it will be, I just wouldn't formalize it yet 
though). The process will need work constantly to reduce this administrative 
burden (this is imo the main goal of the tool, to make it feasable for all 
users).
I wouldn't formalize roles (yet), in the beginning we just need people who 
help wherever it is necessary and share the consensual intention.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A *tag* would list all relevant data of a given proposal (e.g. - it's
</I>&gt;<i> category, date of submission, budget request, location, timing,
</I>&gt;<i> associations, etc.) and link it to the member or members presenting the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>Ideally the proposal contains that information or links to it, yes. You can 
call that tags, but I would just keep links and infoboxes from the 
wiki/interfaces to all information necessary (user-drafted ontologies for 
&quot;tagging&quot; are a wiki feature and in Votorola via Semantic-Mediawiki). We can 
pull in outside information as well, but for the start we can hand-copy it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If a proposal doesn't pass appraisal it would still be tagged and posted,
</I>&gt;<i> but would not have access to the Networks tools and assistance for
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative development and/or funding, until it was able to pass
</I>&gt;<i> appraisal.
</I>Is appraisal something the coop does? Who decides? For me the only constraint 
is that *all* &quot;voters&quot; have to agree for some period before a plan can be 
implemented. They can consensually decide to lower the barrier (2/3, 50%, 
meeting the resource needs, etc.) for some part of the execution though. The 
coop members can decide as well as every other user or entity to support 
certain efforts or vote against them (veto it). 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any and all AFC members would be free to join the Community Network in order
</I>&gt;<i> to: present their own individual proposal(s); track, collaborate in, and
</I>&gt;<i> fund the development of proposals submitted by other members of the
</I>&gt;<i> Network; and to network, interact, and associate with other individuals
</I>&gt;<i> within the membership of the AFC Community Network.
</I>Everybody should have the possibility to join the platform, in fact it should 
be an attractor for coop membership, not an exclusive (discriminatory)  
electorate. Or is there a risk involved here?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any AFC member would be free to make pledges of support (financial and/or in
</I>&gt;<i> kind) to any proposal that has passed the appraisal criteria and been
</I>&gt;<i> posted online. Their pledges would become due upon membership consensus of
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal.
</I>Again any user of the platform should have these freedoms and be able to 
propose anything. Dead proposals could be (re)moved though.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Membership consensus would be attained if there are no *reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> objections* to the proposal one week following notification of a call for
</I>&gt;<i> objections.
</I>A week is a bit short, imagine you are on vacation. I would make it a month 
and, yes, consensus is the default.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Determining which objections are *unreasonable* would be the responsibility
</I>&gt;<i> of an elected body of the membership.....(perhaps the appraisers).
</I>There are legal restrictions and the coop in its role as administrator and 
host of the platform can put constraints ofc. These should be made clear 
indeed, e.g. binding to follow US legislation. 
I would just say that the host of the platform can stop any proposal and 
implementation, which is obvious, but as the software and data is open-source, 
people can implement the proposal on their own platform. The point is imo that 
the consensus-building process itself should filter problematic issues and the 
technology should transcend lockins. It is enough for any user to publicly 
vote against a proposal to veto it. 
Here one can demand that they have to be a citizen of Ashland to start with, 
for instance. But any such rule is already discriminating, as all issues can 
be implicitly global.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A Foundation would be set up to facilitate the funding transaction of
</I>&gt;<i> proposals and to bestow any grants available to certain categories of
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>Ok, sounds reasonable. It should probably be separate from the administrative 
body of the platform (technical staff) though, to build it as &quot;neutral&quot; 
grounds to reach out to other foundations and institutions with the platform. 
But as long as it is open-source, this decision can be adjusted at any later 
time, so we don't have to decide anything here yet.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those proposals attaining the consensus of the membership would become
</I>&gt;<i> available for support and funding from the Foundation.
</I>All proposals can be funded and gain support from any of the voters, but they 
have to reach consensus by *all* public voters to become executable.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Ashland Food Co-op (and others) could offer grants to those proposals it
</I>&gt;<i> felt best fit certain grant criteria. (e.g. - the greatest good for the
</I>&gt;<i> greatest number.)
</I>Yes, but again, they can do that in the process on a day to day basis after 
the fact.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Grant recipients would be selected by the membership at large through a
</I>&gt;<i> process of voting at the end of each cycle. A grant cycle would last for 6
</I>&gt;<i> months. Those proposals voted to receive grants would not need to wait for
</I>&gt;<i> the end of the cycle in order to acquire any pledged funding/resources due
</I>&gt;<i> to them upon reaching the consensus of the Network.
</I>I don't understand that grand cycle, but this should be completely free to 
decide for the coop, I guess. It is then not coupled to the process and not 
important how they decide that (e.g. how they set deadlines in their proposal 
version for their funding).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any member who wanted to participate in the Community Network would need to
</I>&gt;<i> develop an individual web page. The requisite minimum data for this page
</I>&gt;<i> would be the members name and Co-op number. The Co-op number would be kept
</I>&gt;<i> private if requested by the member, but would be used internally to verify
</I>&gt;<i> Co-op membership, and to tag certain aspects of a members interaction,
</I>&gt;<i> association, and participation within the Network for record keeping in the
</I>&gt;<i> Database.
</I>This is a user profile(?) (1) I don't understand what the id-number is for, 
but this can be documented for coop members on their Wikipage/profile for 
instance. Verified E-Mail is enough and you can map identities through 
verified mail addresses alone.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These individual webpages would be hosted by an *AFC Community Network
</I>&gt;<i> website*.
</I>Yes, probably best separate from the actual web-presentation of the coop, but 
possibly on the same network or for now wherever the site works best (again as 
open-source + open-data it can be migrated and forked at any time).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The AFC Community Network website would make it simple and easy for
</I>&gt;<i> individuals to present, search/locate, track, collaborate with, and
</I>&gt;<i> support/fund those proposals a member found interesting and worthwhile. The
</I>&gt;<i> website would also make it easy to connect with the Network community in
</I>&gt;<i> order to share ones interest in, research data on, position towards, and
</I>&gt;<i> relationship to, any proposal currently active in the Community Network.
</I>Yes, except it should be open to anybody imo.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Community Network would establish a Database to track all relevant
</I>&gt;<i> aspects of proposals up to the time of funding.
</I>I am lost again here. The platform has already a database, but (almost) all 
data (no passwords, IP addresses, ...) is public, so anybody can track 
anything they are interested in, put it in databases, print it out or project 
it on displays.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Database would collect and make available data regarding those proposals
</I>&gt;<i> any member was involved in presenting, developing, collaborating on,
</I>&gt;<i> liking, or funding.
</I>Yes, I would name it a Wiki, because that is pretty much a publicly editable 
database and people know that better imo.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any element of this process/structure could be changed at any time by a 3/4
</I>&gt;<i> majority vote of active users of the Network.
</I>Why suddenly 3/4? This would allow discrimination through the backdoor, 
although one can do so if the risk is clearly specified as is with the 
emergency BOD rule.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An active user of the Community Network is a member who has set up their
</I>&gt;<i> individual/personal web page and participated in the development of at
</I>&gt;<i> least one proposal in the year preceding the proposal for a
</I>&gt;<i> process/structure change. This active user participation requirement begins
</I>&gt;<i> one year following the institution of the Community Network. Until one year
</I>&gt;<i> passes, any member who has *joined* the Network may vote on
</I>&gt;<i> process/structure proposals.
</I>I am lost again here.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the Community Network website the membership would be able to interact
</I>&gt;<i> with AFC staff through an online bulletin board linked to the website which
</I>&gt;<i> posts comments, questions, and suggestions from members.....and
</I>&gt;<i> answers/feedback from staff.  The staff could publish their newsletter and
</I>&gt;<i> reports online as well. The BOD could post meeting dates and notes
</I>&gt;<i> regarding the issues on their agenda.
</I>I would just create a separate discussion forum for the coop, it is no big 
deal and a public communication channel for the specific institution of the 
coop. Ideally it would be open to the public as well and had a certain 
discussion space for the voting platform.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This proposal will be submitted to the AFC Board of Directors (BOD)
</I>&gt;<i> following the consensus of those collaborating on the development of this
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>Good.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This proposal will be submitted to the AFC membership at large following the
</I>&gt;<i> consensus of the AFC BOD.
</I>Ok.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The AFC Community Network would be the Beta test for an *City of Ashland*
</I>&gt;<i> Online Community Network.
</I>Well, we can do that. If this was your intent by locking it down on coop 
members, I would like to hear your reasoning behind it. I don't think the 
platform will be unmanageable if it is open to all Ashland citizens from the 
start, but I might be wrong. It needs a long beta phase though and some 
committed users/activists. This is most crucial imo, to get &quot;makers&quot; as users 
who share this vision.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This proposed *Community Network* is intended to be a model that can be
</I>&gt;<i> duplicated and scaled.
</I>Yes, in fact this is metagov's interest, I'd say, here.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone is welcome to comment on and/or participate in the development of
</I>&gt;<i> this proposal.
</I>Yes, permanently. In fact at some point it should be a plan on the platform 
itself.
