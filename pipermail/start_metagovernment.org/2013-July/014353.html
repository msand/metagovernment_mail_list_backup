<PRE>Hi Ned and Stephen,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great response from the BOD! So, there we have it. The board has been
</I>&gt;<i> successfully using discourse-driven decision making, without voting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now the question becomes (for me), would the membership be interested in
</I>&gt;<i> undertaking the experiment of trying to use discourse-driven decision
</I>&gt;<i> making at the scale of the entire co-op? (Perhaps beginning with the
</I>&gt;<i> parking problem ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would move the practice from the &quot;team&quot; scale (the BOD), through
</I>&gt;<i> the community scale (150 or less), to the scale of a small population
</I>&gt;<i> (8,000). To demonstrate that discourse-driven decision making could
</I>&gt;<i> successfully work at that scale would be a big deal. It would provide
</I>&gt;<i> evidence that voting may not be the only possible basis for democracy,
</I>&gt;<i> even at the scale of populations.
</I>
@Ned
You jump to your solution without asking what they need. I won't reply to your 
other answer dedicatedly as I would have to fight on convoluted idealist 
grounds which are from emancipatory struggle dead for over 150 years (with 
German idealism). I could very well do so with Hegel and Marx (probably even 
Adorno and Horkheimer) (1) against (Schelling, Habermas and) your hairball of 
ideas, but I can do real stuff practically, as in help real people form real 
process by helping them writing software for them and you probably will never 
be able to fail as far as you have already &quot;succeeded&quot; in your own theory 
without even asking people what their problem is (but filling tons of pages 
with explaining them how dumb they are). I also don't know what you bring to 
the table practically (e.g. you know that almost every Wiki has a database-
backend?), so I doubt even this discussion is worth the effort (therefore I 
spare the other one) and hence will make this effort only this time. 

In general, Habermas might be helpful to reflect democratic process and 
discourse theory, but his reasons to abandon economical sociology and marxism 
(with its practical dirty everyday struggle) have proven very vague and 
eventually false since the economic and social-democratic (welfare-state) 
crisis of the 70s until today (he has formed his &quot;formalist&quot; theory in the 60s 
really and assumed (welfare-)state power was the end of history economically 
with Adorno, Horkheimer and also Foucault and the following &quot;post-
modernists&quot;). (2) A lot of leftists and civil rights people are still in this 
legal bubble (march through the institutions, try to reform laws etc.). Also 
the reasons for his departure (the crudeness of positivist Leninism), were 
right not only in his theoretical insights but for many &quot;marxists&quot; (1). 
Discourse theory though is not independent from economic basis and does not 
become more so (it seemingly was for Habermas in the biggest boom in history 
when the division between poor and rich was shrinking), but rather gets more 
extreme (Western people like us discussing democracy and people left in US/EU-
backed dictatorships like Egypt struggling for any say. It plays also a very 
important ideological part which Bush and esp. Obama regularly reference for 
their decisions, that they defend this very liberal freedom and justice (as 
Bush replied to anti-war demonstrators in London, saying he would go to war 
for their ideals on television.)

Habermas on the other hand has rather made the pity rest of critical theory in 
Frankfurt school accessible and *positively* consumable by academic discourse 
which marks his success there (Stanford after all is accessible by and 
relevant to everyday &quot;discourse&quot;, right?), rather than bringing it to the 
people. I don't expect you to comprehend that really btw, as it is poorly 
described here and you won't risk to face dumb reality anyway as it can be 
scaringly frustrating and I don't even blame him as he has done serious 
theoretical work and culture bridging and tried really hard. 


So I don't discredit Habermas' discourse theory plainly as this was not right 
and not really critical in the most honest sense, one has to study discourse 
theory to judge it and democratic rights can be very important (discourse has 
been in fact at heart in many revolutions in history, e.g. Russian revolution 
of 1905, 1917 and following democratic struggles of the sovjets until 
Kronstadt, the German revolution of 1918, global revolutionary moments 1968, 
the deconstruction of &quot;Leninism&quot; 1989 etc... and in general in moments beyond 
and inside bourgeois society where fundamental discussion is and was 
necessary, strikes, civil rights movement, women's movement, but esp. in the 
last two it also failed). But your recent reply as well as many discussions 
here (on the list) as well as political analysis' of Habermas on democracy in 
the EU show that they lack any grounding in social/political struggle and lose 
themselves in abstract legalist/discursive/technical terms which have no 
reality in any social conflict and political action, but only construct 
alleged solutions to avoid the real problems and failures and the *fucking* 
contradictions and even more *fucking* practical obstacles (the Iraq war was a 
success, right?, because it had the biggest anti-war demonstration for liberal 
rights in history, which were subsequently coopted by the establishment 
fighting for women rights etc., all a line of progressive discursive progress 
through international treaties. The point is not whether you argue that way, 
but that I can hijack these arguments like Bush, Obama and even Habermas and 
his academic peers do to justify these or some other actions if they see fit). 
This critique applies to Votorola as well, it has potential, but I am not sure 
if it is only imagined. So without a root discourse theory regresses to boring 
and poor idealism.

To frame the problem specifically, this quote of yours proves that you have no 
idea about political practice and probably have never desperately tried to 
fight one on the streets to really gain rights (I thought wiser was defending 
people's rights?):
&quot;Because Votorola uses voting and delegation, the system can be 
easily gamed by the rich and powerful and well-connected and 
charismatic.&quot; Votorola probably will never be very powerful, but claiming that 
power will seek a totally transparent discursive (all proposals have to be 
transparent in Votorola) process for abuse is ridiculous, probably no matter 
what tool or practice of metagov you put as subject in this sentence. It will 
and historically has always side-stepped the transparency and undermined the 
process by using its real, dirty, everyday power beyond the process, no matter 
how smart you think you are, discourse will never be all of society and it 
will be lurking in these shades for you, because power has to produce itself. 
It will also just kill the process, you cannot safeguard discourse from 
within. Yours is only a problem in your mind and of a few other &quot;social 
scientists&quot; [charisma e.g. is a pseudo-scientific social theory, which is 
anti-democratic even in its allegation and you have just put it in there to 
group any form of imaginary power (what does well-connected mean, when 
everybody uses an open-source e-dem process?) and make power self-sufficient 
as if it already came from nowhere but the e-dem process itself. it is also 
again not your theory]. Hence my excursus on idealism and your need to root 
your theoretical speculations. 
You can't disprove this weakness theoretically except for your mind, so spare 
your time repeating your own mixed-up terminology and show practical 
historical examples (wiser should have examples, shouldn't it?) and insights 
and prove the practical success of your theories (give real reasons and 
practical arguments in discursive terms and really help people instead of 
teaching them). At least you should be able to demonstrate Blinap on a real 
issue without having to force people to adopt it first, right? 


I told you to stay away from putting your solution and instead helping the 
coop and cooperate on that, but you can't even restrain yourself and really 
help people, but have to start arguing again and put your solution first, so 
again such an unnecessarily stupid obstacle imo, though not unsurprising, 
because probably this advise is all you have to offer and hence you press it 
hard. 
(I mean your &quot;discourse&quot; driven Blinap process forced on people and 
artificially opposed to voting because you have made up and patch-worked some 
theory to divorce them (how superficially ironic to demand it as the golden 
measure of democracy from a democratic coop at first btw.). Again I am not 
interested in your theory as long as you can't explain it in historical and 
sociological reality down to everyday empirical experience consistently, 
reference your theoretical sources and have helped some people with it 
practically. You should be able to do so with your peers on wiser.org if you 
have social experience. (I and seemingly most people here on the list really 
can't understand otherwise, because words can mean a lot or nothing, esp. if 
you don't have to stick to them or your sources, this also applies to this 
very critique of mine and other posts here, so I don't want to continue this 
fruitless idealist discussion, you will ofc. reply, but do so practically if 
you want to expect answers, I hope I have made that now really clear!). There 
are already more than enough of these &quot;theories&quot; and most of these 
&quot;democratic&quot; ideas  actually older than a hundred years and constantly failing 
except for proving the smartness of their author for him/herself against the 
dumbness of the people. 
Theory inspired by practice on the other hand would be refreshing for this 
list and community imo. Theory citing its sources at least arguable, if 
somebody felt like it.



My question to Stephen and the Coop would rather be what they need to broaden 
and deepen their democratic process, especially the economical success of the 
coop. 
If the members are comfortable with the BOD, what point does it have to push 
all 8000 people to drive decisions (if only a part does, things get even worse 
than now) they rather delegate to the BOD? How do you picture them to accept 
(and carry the practical burden of) this expectation of yours without a 
concrete problem just for the sake of non-voting? After all they have decided 
as *owners* to elect the BOD and can decide otherwise at any time. If you 
really want to criticize coops you could study the critiques of Mondragon imo, 
this would be at least helpful in context. (3)

@Stephen
The parking lot is a good mundane example. Can this problem be solved by the 
coop alone or do they need new ground for it? Can it be shared by other 
groups?
Generally, can this issue or another one be exploited to foster democracy and 
be more successful with it than without? How does the coop picture to endorse 
democratic process and increase its reach? Opening up to the own membership 
base can be an option, but only if it is interested and can bring value to the 
table which the BOD cannot (e.g. voluntary labour). Are there cases where this 
could be exploited? What kind of outreach and external interface can be built 
to allow outsiders help with their problems to mutual benefit? (e.g. Urban 
gardening, composting, construction work, you name it). Are there online 
processes where this could be hooked in? (e.g. forums or production line 
software)
This is what I think is most interesting now.

(1) If you prefer a contemporary English author, I'd propose Paul Mattick: 
&quot;Business as usual&quot;.
(2) POLITICA. J&#252;rgen Habermas. Theorie und Praxis. Luchterhand 1967. 
For example p. 190 ff, about the law of falling profit, which currently makes 
more than 40 million people permanently unemployed in core 
industrial/capitalist nations, destroys the industrial basis of capitalism 
(most capital nowadays doesn't invest in production anymore) and constantly 
undermines and destroys the welfare-state which allowed capitalism to claim 
the end of history in Habermas' theory. Just one example of how vague the 
necessity for discourse theory alone can be.

(3) e.g. The Myth of Mondragon Cooperatives, Politics, and Working - Class 
Life in a Basque Town. 1996
