Hi Ned,
Thanks for responding. I appreciate your feedback. 

&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; *Appraisers* would be elected and trained by the Community
</I>&gt;<i>   Network.

&gt;<i> Here is my counter-proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any member can register to be put into the pool of available appraisers. The individual can register as a general appraiser, or can specify particular categories of interest.
</I>
OK. They would still need to be trained though....to some degree.
Maybe it would just be 'a requirement for them to read the *Appraisal Training Manual*...with a brief test following'?

&gt;<i> When a new proposal is received, it is appraised (tagged, categorized, judged) by the proposer (as part of the submission process).
</I>
Yes, this would perhaps make the appraisers job a little easier and would help to familiarize *proposers* with the appraisal process. 
Also, by &quot;judged&quot; do you mean, 'as to whether a proposal fits the proposal *criteria*'?

&gt;<i> The proposal is then distributed (by a set of individuals pretending to be a software distribution program) to appraisers in the pool, using the proposer's categorization.
</I>
Ok....who would those individuals be...and what would they be called...*proposal distributers*? Or would this be done by an initial *organizing committee*....until the software could be developed?

&gt;<i> Upon receiving a new proposal, each appraiser can choose to independently appraise it (or not). 
</I>
It seems to me it would be good to have (at least) 2 appraisers working independently on each proposal. If there are discrepancies between them and/or the proposers *submission appraisal*, there would follow an *investigation* as you suggest below.

&gt;<i> All appraisals that are received are then compared. [I]n the beginning, an investigator would be selected from the pool of investigators to do the comparisons manually, and then investigate any discrepancies among the appraisals.
</I>
&gt;<i> Any member can register to be put into the pool of available investigators. Again, the individual can register as a general investigator, or can specify particular categories of interest.
</I>
&gt;<i> The investigation (if there is one) culminates with the investigator making a proposal of findings and recommendations. (These proposals are primary drivers of the evolution of the decision system.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The investigation process is the alternative to having a training process. Everybody is continually learning together, &quot;on the job&quot;, as things move along.
</I>
Ok..I think I'm liking all of that. We have pools of *appraisers, distributors, and investigators*. Would there be any reason not to combine (any of) these into the same pool?

&gt;<i> Instead of paying salaries and such to vested positions, appraising and investigating are project work, with payment for service rendered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How much would be paid would be determined through discourse-through-proposing.
</I>
I'm thinking (some) people would volunteer for the positions mentioned above....at least initially. I suppose it would depend (to some degree) on how involved or lengthly a proposal is....or becomes as it is developed further. Which brings up the question as to whether proposals would need to be re-appraised at some point before they were put to a *call for objections*.

Also, what would the requisite disconnect/disclosure be between *appraisers, distributors, and investigators* and the *proposers*?
Ashland is a small town and it's very likely that one could know the other.
