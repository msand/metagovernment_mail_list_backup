</I>&gt;<i> I couldn't agree more that the rules - as you call them - of money are

</I>&gt;<i> It's not about rules though in my opinion. Rules are enforced but their is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes there is lots of rules that need enforcement and are enforced.
In germany, its the BAFIN and i think in the US its the SEC?
Then three is &quot;Money laundering laws&quot; and lots of stuff that prevents those
who dig into the matter to start an alternative system.



&gt;<i> In my opinion the problems lay with the design of our national currencies.
</I>&gt;<i> Compared to the designs of the 14th century the designs of our contemporary
</I>&gt;<i> currencies have not changed at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I dont want to discuss money, because there cant anything be done about the
money system right now. I've been through years of endless discussions and
lots of inspirational ideas and precise criticism of the issues, but its
not possible to act on it in a way that would change anything. In order to
change the money system, you first would have to fix democracy... ...but
there might be a second way and that is through changing how people use
&quot;equity&quot; :-) ..which also has a lot to do with democracy on a corporate
level, because it decides who gets to vote and who not.



&gt;<i> Some theoretical ways in which the design could change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - individual currency units could be taggable so that as a currency unit
</I>&gt;<i> passes through various hands tags could be added but never removed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
bitcoin has that mechanism, but it doesnt say a thing about how money is
created and how it might vanish... but really, this discussion will lead to
nowhere...


&gt;<i> - the complete history of individual currency units could be made
</I>&gt;<i> available for consultation at will.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
people dont care. It's already online and if you want to learn about it,
there is an endless stream of videos and texts and the like available.


&gt;<i> These are just two suggestions that would radically change our world
</I>&gt;<i> beyond recognition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Throughout the years I've developed a potential method through via which
</I>&gt;<i> the transition between our current national currencies and a newly designed
</I>&gt;<i> currency could happen without any government intervention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Many people have, small local currencies exist, but they will never replace
the big currencies. As soon as one might grow to a point where it will look
promising, the law's kick in and its brought down one way or another.
Happened many times in the past.

What do you think about the way we treat equity?

</I>&gt;<i> Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i'm sure everyone here knows theres lots of issues with democracy and
</I>&gt;<i> voting and lots of stuff that could be improved on that &quot;frontier&quot;, but i
</I>&gt;<i> came to think, that there is some very related subjects and thats equity
</I>&gt;<i> and money.
</I>&gt;<i> Equity gives you votes in the context of your equity.
</I>&gt;<i> Money gives you the right to buy and thus vote on who will prosper and who
</I>&gt;<i> will not (voting with your purse...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I came to the conclusion, that the rules/laws around money are broken and
</I>&gt;<i> so are the rules around equity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know the forbes magazine and their listing of the 100 richest
</I>&gt;<i> persons on the planet? 98 of them are entrepreneurs, 1 is Steve Balmer from
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft and the last one, i dont know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to get insanely rich, u have to abuse the broken laws for
</I>&gt;<i> equity, thus found and raise a successful company.
</I>&gt;<i> The other way would be to get into the financial industrie and instead of
</I>&gt;<i> abusing broken equity rules, u would abuse broken money laws.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In essence it eneables you to live of of other peoples work to some degree.
</I>&gt;<i> These broken laws are the main, if not the ONLY reason for the &quot;great and
</I>&gt;<i> ever stretching divide&quot; between rich and poor. Its also the reason for the
</I>&gt;<i> financial crisis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe money is an issue that cannot be tackled right now and have a
</I>&gt;<i> couple of arguments why i think that to be true which i dont want to get
</I>&gt;<i> into now, but i think its totally possible to tackle the equity issue and i
</I>&gt;<i> believe with the equity issue tackled, the money issue will follow by
</I>&gt;<i> itself sooner or later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this topic somehow sound interesting? If so, i would really like to
</I>&gt;<i> get into the details, but if there is nobody on this list who is interested
</I>&gt;<i> in these topics, i dont want to waste your time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> kind regards
