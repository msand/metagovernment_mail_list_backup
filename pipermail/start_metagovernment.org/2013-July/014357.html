<PRE>Hi Conseo,

&gt;<i> My question to Stephen and the Coop would rather be what they need to broaden

</I>
I imagine many (perhaps most) members would say the Co-op's process is *deep enough* as it appears to be very open and successful already.

&gt;<i> If the members are comfortable with the BOD, what point does it have to push 
</I>&gt;<i> all 8000 people to drive decisions (if only a part does, things get even worse 
</I>&gt;<i> than now) they rather delegate to the BOD?
</I>
I don't actually see pushing the membership at large into &quot;driving&quot; the day to day decisions the *management* is currently making. I'm very comfortable with the model the Co-op is currently using to run their/our business.  What I'm imagining (as a possibility) is organizing the Co-op membership into a network that can develop, approve, and fund projects for the good of the community *at large*. As I said earlier, the Co-op already has a community grant program that gives funding to organizations in the area that are working on issues of social justice and environmental sustainability, (etc). I'm seeing something that is a little larger...and organized by the membership at large.

&gt;<i> How do you picture them to accept 
</I>&gt;<i> (and carry the practical burden of) this expectation of yours without a 
</I>&gt;<i> concrete problem just for the sake of non-voting?
</I>
The world is full of concrete problems from the community level on up to the global level. What I'm interested in is developing a model for organizing creative and intelligent action that is directed towards finding solutions to some of those problems. I'm not interested in doing this &quot;just for the sake of non-voting&quot;.

&gt;<i> After all they have decided 
</I>&gt;<i> as *owners* to elect the BOD and can decide otherwise at any time. If you 
</I>&gt;<i> really want to criticize coops you could study the critiques of Mondragon imo, 
</I>&gt;<i> this would be at least helpful in context. (3)
</I>
Personally, I'm not interested in criticizing co-ops. I think they're great. I would like to see a lot more of them.

&gt;<i> @Stephen
</I>&gt;<i> The parking lot is a good mundane example. Can this problem be solved by the 
</I>&gt;<i> coop alone or do they need new ground for it? Can it be shared by other 
</I>&gt;<i> groups?
</I>
I just mentioned the parking issue because Ned asked what &quot;real world 'growing tip' problems the Co-op&quot; was having. The Co-op is currently trying to buy out the bank next door which would give them both more parking and more square footage for the store. The bank would have to move obviously and the City of Ashland has an ordinance that won't permit any more drive-up window locations in town. This was legislated years ago to prevent more fast food franchises from moving into town. Last I heard this idea was going to be presented to the City Council for some kind of variance. I don't know the latest.....

&gt;<i> Generally, can this issue or another one be exploited to foster democracy and 
</I>&gt;<i> be more successful with it than without?
</I>
Again, I'm not sure approaching the membership from a standpoint of &quot;let us help you fix your problems&quot; would be the better option.

&gt;<i> How does the coop picture to endorse 
</I>&gt;<i> democratic process and increase its reach? Opening up to the own membership 
</I>&gt;<i> base can be an option, but only if it is interested and can bring value to the 
</I>&gt;<i> table which the BOD cannot (e.g. voluntary labour).
</I>
Yes, &quot;bringing value to the table&quot;.....I like that!  In my mind, that looks like setting up an online member owned and organized network that can propose, enact, and fund creative and collaborative solutions to make *the community* a better place in which to live. 

&gt;<i> What kind of outreach and external interface can be built 
</I>&gt;<i> to allow outsiders help with their problems to mutual benefit? (e.g. Urban 
</I>&gt;<i> gardening, composting, construction work, you name it). Are there online 
</I>&gt;<i> processes where this could be hooked in? (e.g. forums or production line 
</I>&gt;<i> software).
</I>
These are exactly the questions I'm trying to answer. I need your (and others) help with this!

&gt;<i>  This is what I think is most interesting now.
</I>
I agree. Let's figure something out...together!

Thanks so much!
