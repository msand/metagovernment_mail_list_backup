<PRE>Hi Mike,

I would not be engaging in this exchange if I did not consider it to be 
worthwhile. (In fact, I feel that it has the potential to be extremely 
worthwhile -- to lead to some very good things.)

I say that as a kind of warning: I am about to &quot;pick a nit&quot;, but only 
because I consider it to be a very important nit to pick. My view is 
that full direct democracy should be our goal, not &quot;guided&quot; polyarchy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; ... I would say that we don't need a separate primary guidance
    system. To have such a system would be unnecessary, expensive,
    wasteful, and distracting.

    Mike&gt; The need is to inform the deciders of what the decision ought
    to be. Do the deciders already have this knowledge on your &quot;planet&quot;,
    as you put it?

    Ned&gt; blah, blah, blah, ...

    Mike&gt; I think you're answering &quot;no&quot;. Some of your deciders have
    initial, personal opinions on what the decision ought to be, but
    none of them has actual knowledge. They'd first have to acquire that
    knowledge. This acquisition is what I call &quot;primary guidance&quot;.

Ned&gt; I agree with you that &quot;no&quot; is the correct answer if &quot;no&quot; means this:

    Of course not, silly, the deciders cannot have knowledge of what the
    decision ought to be at the start. The knowledge of what the
    decision ought to be only comes into existence at the moment that
    the decision is made. Before deliberations have started, what the
    decision ought to be is unknowable; that knowledge does not exist yet.

But, the question you appear to be &quot;really&quot; asking is this:

    *Given* that the knowledge of what the decision ought to be *does*
    exist prior to the beginning of decider deliberations, have the
    deciders acquired or been given this knowledge prior to the
    beginning of their deliberations?

If this is the question, then the appropriate answer is &quot;mu&quot;. In this 
case, the question is a &quot;Have you stopped beating your wife?&quot; question: 
giving either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; as an answer would ratify the *false* 
assumption/assertion that the knowledge of what the decision ought to be 
exists prior to the beginning of decider deliberations. In the system 
that I have been describing, that knowledge *cannot* be known at the 
start, because it only comes into existence at the end, at the point 
that the decision is made.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; Primary guidance is technically optional. It's quite possible
    to say what a decision *will* be, without ever knowing what it
    *ought* to be.

Ned&gt; Are you claiming that a discourse-driven direct democratic decision 
system is incapable of determining *both* what a decision ought to be 
*and* what the decision will be? If so, I would be very interested to 
read your arguments in support of that claim.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; But usually this is undesireable.

Ned&gt; Here you appear to be claiming that a two-system arrangement 
(primary guidance --&gt; authoritative deciding) is more desirable that a 
single-system arrangement such as the one that I have been describing. I 
would be very interested to read your arguments in support of this claim.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; Blinap may be attempting to address the deficiency by housing
    the production of both the guiding knowledge (what ought to be) and
    the fact of decisions (what will be) in a single system. This would
    be a design choice.

Ned&gt; Yes! Blinap is (I claim) a much better design choice than Votorola 
through which to discover the knowledge of &quot;what ought to be&quot;, with the 
added benefit that Blinap can also, simultaneously, determine &quot;what will 
be&quot; better than any existing authoritative decision system (at the scale 
of populations, from the perspective of humanity, nature, and future 
generations). My contention is that Blinap is a much better design 
choice for public decision making than Votorola+Whatever.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; Another design choice is a specialized system that produces
    only the guiding knowledge. This is Votorola's design. As a
    consequence, Votorola is compatible with any and all decision
    systems that are based on formal choice (voting), including Blinap.
    This is one advantage of a specialized design, what is called
    &quot;rationalization&quot;.

Ned&gt; From the perspective of public decision making through Blinap, 
Votorola (or any such specialized &quot;guidance-only&quot; system) is 
unnecessary, expensive, wasteful, and distracting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To All:
We (the dedicated few, who are seeking to provide the world with better 
public decision systems) do not have a lot of resources. If we work 
together, we can do more good. If we work smart, we can do more good.

Each of us is free to deploy her own personal resources however she sees 
fit. We can choose to scatter ourselves across myriad &quot;boutique&quot; 
projects (as we mostly have been doing).

But we also have the option to do the bloody hard work of arriving 
together at &quot;what ought to be&quot; through discourse, before we start 
slinging code. (This is what Mike and I have been doing, and why I find 
it of value.)

The more we can work together, the more we can focus our efforts, the 
more support we will be able to attract, and the more and faster 
progress we will be able to make toward a better world.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will now make another attempt to answer the question ... :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On my planet, when an initial proposal is proposed, the proposer is one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the deciders. As decider, I guess you could say that she probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;already knows&quot; (that is, has an opinion about) what the decision ought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Notification is sent, and those who receive the notification do not, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most cases, at the beginning &quot;already know&quot; (have an opinion about) what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the decision ought to be -- they have to think about it, and study, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order to come to an opinion regarding what they think the decision ought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As the ensuing discourse-through-proposing proceeds, individual deciders
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may change their opinions any number of times regarding what the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision ought to be. So, through this period I guess we could say that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual deciders may or may not &quot;already know&quot; what their opinion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will wind up being by the time the decision happens.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The decision happens at the point that there are no unresolved valid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objections to the implementation of some proposal (which may or may not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be the initial proposal). Until that point, no one knows what will be,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and each has her own opinion about what ought to be. When all of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;ought to be&quot; opinions line up (through discourse), the decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happens, like the jackpot of a slot machine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In a &quot;full&quot; direct democracy (which my planet has), there are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separate decision systems to deal with &quot;what ought to be&quot; and &quot;what will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be&quot;. There is just the one decision system, that receives proposals from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anybody and spits out what will be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I am trying my best to come up with a definitive &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is just not happenin' ... Sorry! Your question contains implicit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assumptions about &quot;how things must be&quot; that are not valid for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision system that my planet uses.)
