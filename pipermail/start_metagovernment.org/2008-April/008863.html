Both of you are making an important distinction which had profound  
ramifications. This same logic also is the fourth basic principle on  
the Metagovernment website: &quot;Without consensus, there is no law.&quot;

This is in a nutshell what distinguishes bottom-up governance from top- 
down governance. It makes government much more minimalist; at least  
until people get used to the idea of forming consensus on the very  
need for laws.

And it risks making us look like Libertarians; a distinction I would  
like to avoid, as I think the full scope of open source governance is  
simply radically different than any classic political definition. Like  
Libertarians, we clearly are advocating that individuals take  
responsibility for their community, but unlike them we also are  
providing substantial structure instead of pure Laissez-faire.  
Libertarians don't trust government. I feel that government is  
absolutely trustworthy: if it is truly an embodiment of all of the  
people and it is radically transparent.

This is another argument for this project starting on the smallest  
sized communities first. People will need a lot of familiarity with  
these concepts before they are ready to implement this sort of  
governance on major divisive issues.
