<PRE>I would also like to add that a forum may be less user friendly for
people with disabilities. There are e-mail clients which help their
users overcome their problems and act as equals, possibly without you
even noticing. By switching to a medium that may not have that kind of
support, new and unnecessary barriers are introduced.

A blind person has enough problems as it is. Discussions about
changing society are a valuable contribution they can make. Exposing
their disability may lead to them being treated with respect or
caution, beyond which they deserve on the basis of their contribution
to the discussion. They don't want pity, they want to make a
difference.

Text is simple, e-mail is text. If a person can read, write and think
clearly, that should be enough for them to contribute to a discussion.
If a forum requires more from its users, that is discrimination, plain
and simple, even if it wasn't intended.

Now I'll be the first to admit, that I'm using this argument to
support mailing lists as a medium, even though we may never have a
member of the discussion, to which the argument applies, just because
(in case you haven't noticed) I like e-mail. But at the very least
it's something we have to consider, not just as an afterthought while
designing the software. In my experience, universal access, isn't
something the designer of a forum puts all to much thought into.
