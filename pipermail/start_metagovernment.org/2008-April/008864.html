<PRE>It looks like several of our conversations are leaning toward the same  
conclusion: that open source governments need to be self defining.

Earlier, I had suggested that we define &quot;government&quot; as &quot;the  
organizing principle of a community.&quot; Of ANY community, from a handful  
of people who get together to play poker on Saturday nights, to the  
people who work in a particular hospital, to all the people living in  
one urban area, to everyone in the world. Each of those is a  
community, and each community needs some sort of governance.

If we can allow any community to form its own government, then the  
issue of branching and merging is handled by the communities. If there  
are two distinct communities on either side of a river, and if these  
two communities see a commonality between them, then they can form a  
third community which contains both. The two smaller communities can  
continue to operate, but will only make laws relevant to issues only  
affecting their side of the river. The larger community would handle  
issues that affect both sides of the river. If the smaller communities  
find that their issues are all better handled by the larger community,  
then they will just fade away over time as people stop participating  
in them.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I see it there might only be 1 law in effect at the time but the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synthesised with another development also not yet part of the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agreed statute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> books. So its theoretically more adaptable as a result of more  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variations being explored, and it provides a useful framework for  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> major
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developments to be collaboratively trialed and managed without  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contaminating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the latest &quot;stable release&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now that I say that, I can't think how wikipedia get away without  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> branches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as they have inter-related articles and topic micro-sites that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considerable collaborative development?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the answer is that they keep their branches very small. ie.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion pages with reference to the edit history is where  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> branches are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explored and debated. If branches can be kept small then more  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effort goes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into trunk development and the project can advance at a faster pace.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It makes a lot of sense for us to have some facility for branches,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there to be constant pressure (perhaps as in wikipedia's case  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exerted by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system itself as there is little facility for large branches) to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keep them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as small as possible. In manufacturing terms this keeps us a low  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inventory,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lean outfit with a high return on our investments and the ability  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to quickly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shift output capacity from one area to another.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But there does have to be only one &quot;distribution version&quot; of the law
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> at any one time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right, the distributed versions are intended for changes, that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventually should be merged back into the &quot;main&quot; repository.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The important thing here, is to give an overview of the
