<PRE>Hello. My name is Ed Pastore. I was born in the United States, and I  
currently reside in Alexandria, Virginia, United States.

My background is in philosophy, information technology, and web  
development. I have a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Emory  
University. Since getting that degree, I have worked for fifteen years  
in information technology, where I managed every aspect of a company's  
I.T. needs, and where I worked extensively in developing, publishing,  
and maintaining several websites.

My interest in open, web-based governance started when I discovered  
and became an active editor of Wikipedia. The success of Wikipedia was  
surprising to me, given that it was an open system: I had not realized  
that pure openness could avoid degrading into complete anarchy. In  
fact, it seemed like such a success that I naturally began to wonder  
why similar principles couldn't be applied to human governance.

I have long felt that representative democracy is hardly democratic,  
especially here in the United States. Here, true enfranchisement is  
reserved for the well-connected, and the average citizen gets a  
practically meaningless say in government. Why not, I thought, allow  
every person to contribute to every part of government as much as they  
please? All we would need is a way to moderate that participation.  
 From there, as I started discussing this concept with others, the  
rest of the pieces quickly fell into place, and the Metagovernment  
project was born.

I set up the website and continued to update it as other people gave  
me feedback (so the current site is an amalgam of many people's  
thoughts, not just my own). I have been looking forward to the time  
when others would be more directly involved with this process, and a  
gladly welcome your participation. I envision a world without leaders,  
and I therefore have no desire to be &quot;the leader&quot; of this project. As  
soon as we can come up with a governance structure for this committee,  
I will eagerly share control of this project as directed by the group.

I look forward to working with you all.
