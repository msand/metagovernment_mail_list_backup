<PRE>We're in imminent danger of veering off in different directions at
different speeds. For example, I am clearly not on the same wavelength as
Manuel. I indicated dissent yesterday at his IRC proposals but clearly
misunderstood the context in which he made that proposal, for which I
apologise.

Essentially some of us are clearly rarin to go and want to dive right on
into the coding. Others, including myself, are still at the stage of
trying to get a clear image of what it is we are trying to achieve and
why.

The notes below represent a brutally condensed form of the conclusions I
have reached in answer to the question: Why Do We Need a Social Decision
Making Process at all? They constitute 8 principles which, in my view,
ought to inform any attempt at producing a scalable democratic debating
mechanism. My immediate question, therefore, is does this description
itself attract consensus?

1 - Conflict Management
The principle purpose of a Rational Social Decision Making Process (RSDMP)
is Conflict Management. I used to say Conflict Avoidance but that ignored
all the positive forms of conflict.

Conflict lies on a spectrum. At the positive end, we have sporting,
artistic and intellectual conflict which constantly push the boundaries of
human performance and gradually raise the &quot;human condition&quot;.

In the middle we have conflicts over control. What shall the rules be and
who shall make them? What constitutes acceptable and unacceptable
behaviour? Who owns what and why?

At the negative end we have violent conflict ranging from domestic
violence through street fighing, civil wars and on up to the invasion and
conquest of foreign territory.

The main goal of any RSDMP is to prevent legitimate ethical conflict
becoming unethical conflict and, in particular to prevent escalation to
violent conflict.

2 - Consensus
The most obvious and ideal way to avoid violent conflict is to avoid all
conflict - i.e. to achieve Consensus; the complete absence of dissent. The
first aim, therefore, of any RDSMP is to explore the possibility of
Consensus. We cannot skirt this issue by defining something less than
consensus (eg 99% support) as consensus. All that amounts to is an attempt
to suppress evidence of conflict.

3 - Necessity
On many issues, however, true Consensus is rarely achievable. Failure to
reach consensus, however, will equally rarely end the debate.
Nevertheless, that is the rational next step for any RSDMP - to determine
whether, in the absence of consensus, any decision is still necessary.

4 - Compromise
Often, even though consensus cannot be reached on an issue, there may well
be consensus, or at least an overwhelming majority in agreement that the
issue is so important that it MUST be resolved. In a RSDMP this implies
the search for Compromise. Furthermore we can define the minimum
requirements for an ethically acceptable compromise in terms of Pareto
Efficiency. At the very least proponents of a compromise must be able to
demonstrate that their proposal is a Pareto Improvement - someone gains
and NOBODY loses. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency</A>

The Pareto Optimal condition is reached when no further Pareto
Improvements can be made. This is equivalent to saying that the optimal
result of compromise is that which produces the greatest social gain. But
although we could probably achieve consensus on the previous sentence, we
could almost certainly not achieve consensus on what constitutes that
&quot;greatest social gain&quot; in any given situation. This forms the core of most
political argument. Nevertheless, it should be possible to gain acceptance
of the Pareto principle: that in normal circumstances, any proposed
resolution to an issue must include evidence that there is a net gain and
that no one loses.

5 - Majority Rule
Providing that a proposal meets the Pareto conditions, it is ethical and
rational to reach the final decision on the basis of Majority support.
Clearly, the larger the majority the better, but providing that no one can
be harmed as the result of a decision, even a simple majority can produce
a fair result. While it may be true that not everyone is happy with the
outcome, by (Pareto) definition no-one will be any worse off. ONLY if that
condition is met is it ethical to &quot;impose&quot; the majority will.

6 - Compensation
The aim of avoiding loss, however, does not mean that being able to
demonstrate potential harm or loss is sufficient to block a proposal. It
means that the proposal MUST take account of the potential harm by
offering fair compensation.

7 - Veto
Any proposal which can be shown to cause wholly or partially uncompensated
loss is an illegitimate threat to the interests of the potential victim
which they are entitled to defend themselves against. In this context and
in line with point 4 above, this means that any such proposal should be
inadmissible for debate; the authors should be obliged to return with
appropriate compensation clauses.

No individual or minority can be obliged to tolerate a threat to their
legitimate material interests. They may not be able to resist but no
legitimate law can be made which forbids them from trying. Furthermore,
although Society is obligated to offer fair compensation, the individual
under threat cannot be obligated to accept it. There is no ethical basis
for &quot;eminent domain&quot;. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain</A>

This &quot;right of self defence&quot; constitutes the formal basis for the right of
Veto.

8 - Compulsion
When an individual or minority exercises the right of Veto, a state of
formal conflict exists between the majority and the minority and both
sides will have to assess, as rationally as they can, how far they are
prepared to escalate that conflict. This implies a separate debate within
both the majority and the minority. The majority must decide whether there
is a separate consensus within their own ranks that the issue is so
important that compliance must be compelled and, if so, by what means and
by whom. The minority must decide if they are prepared to resist such
compulsion, if necessary with their own military force.

Clearly there is a restricted consensus (restricted to the ranks of the
majority) on the need for compulsion on a wide variety of issues, from
which side of the road we drive on, to the prevention of paedophile abuse
or rape.  So my support for the Veto principle should not be read as
support for the immunity from compulsory compliance where a majority feels
strongly enough to impose it.
