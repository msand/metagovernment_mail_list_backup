As far as I can tell, Wikipedia succeeds because the people who want  
to contribute are more motivated than the people who want to destroy.  
There is always vandalism of wikipedia. If you look at the history of  
the article &quot;monkey&quot; you will see that it is vandalized constantly.  
But the people who want it to be a good article simply care more than  
the people who want to write &quot;I am cool&quot; on the page.

Parts of this model would be wonderful when applied to government:  
issues could be addressed by the people who cared about them the most.

But the difference is that Wikipedia is descriptive, while government  
is prescriptive. With Wikipedia, there is a relatively agreeable goal  
for everyone: to describe something dispassionately. For government,  
agreement is much more difficult to achieve.

That is why the Metagovernment website currently proposes a scoring  
system: to promote the contributions of the people who are the most  
respected. And it is also why it has a bias toward synthesis and the  
principle of &quot;consensus through synthesis.&quot;

In a large-scale, politically divided community, the idea of consensus  
is only imaginable through synthesis. When half the people want one  
thing and half want another, we have three options. We can do nothing,  
which usually means one side wins. We can compromise, which usually  
means both sides lose. Or we can synthesize, and come up with  
something which actually provides a long-term solution to the needs of  
both sides.
