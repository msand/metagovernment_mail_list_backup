<PRE>I have updated <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/">http://www.metagovernment.org/</A> significantly to reflect  
some of the conclusions I believe we were reaching in the  
conversations we have had so far.

I apologize for doing this without formal approval, but the website  
was so out of date compared to what we have been talking about that I  
thought it had to be updated, and I will not have much time in the  
next week to work on it.

The great thing about the edits I did (as Manuel's repository will  
show) is that all of them were simplifications. I cut out large  
sections of text that are no longer relevant, and overall the concept  
is more concise.

It will need further cleanup, but I think that now it is on the right  
track.

Please have a look at the site as it exists now. I think it is now a  
pretty good summary of the work we have done so far.

FYI, I will have limited availability for the next week (until April  
28).
