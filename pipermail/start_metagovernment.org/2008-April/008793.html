This is very much my thinking as well. If you look at almost any other  
species of social animals, you always see a leader for each group.  
This is the basic way an animal group can maintain order.

If you give those animals language, self-awareness, commerce, a vast  
global society, and technology to create enormously complex social  
groups... do they still need to rely on the basic animal leadership  
structure?

It seems to me that, with the advent of internet-based social  
networking, we have finally come up with the mechanism to implement  
something better. I really have no doubt that human governance will  
move entirely to the internet sometime in the next hundred years. My  
motivation in getting together a group of open-source-proponents to  
create it is to beat the traditional institutions to the punch.

If open source doesn't succeed first, humanity could remain under the  
rule of traditional institutions which simply have moved to the  
internet. Or perhaps something even worse; where Microsoft or NewsCorp  
end up in control (via FaceBook and MySpace).

Right now is a potential turning point in history, where humanity will  
decide what sort of mechanism will be in control of online governance.  
Will it be traditional leadership-based governments, or will it be  
commercial corporations, or will it be all people brought together in  
the most open, inclusive, and transparent system we can possibly create?
