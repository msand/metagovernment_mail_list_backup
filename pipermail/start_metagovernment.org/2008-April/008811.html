Consider this partnership in respect to similar projects on the web:

Imagine if YouTube or Wikipedia had decided to partner with the bodies that
typically legislate their content (ie. Mainstream Media). Citizen Journalism
would have been impossible as the sites would have been focused on promoting
the same Hollywood material strictly for the benefit of the owners.

The same is true of Blogs or Podcasts -- two forms of citizen media that
simply could not exist on the same televisions, radios, or newspapers that
are controlled by their own &quot;legislative bodies.&quot; Point being: we didn't
work with them. We acknowledged our own value and simply replaced the
recording industry (for example) with MP3s.

Maybe I'm dreaming, but I imagine the same results from Metagovernment --
similar to when the American Revolutionaries told King George that you are
no longer our leader, and drafted a Constitution which outlined our rights
as individuals.
