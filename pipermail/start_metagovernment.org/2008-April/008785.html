<PRE>I think our priority right now could be to establish common cause and common ground. Clearly we already have that in spades at a high level but I mean to start drilling down into some of the detail and developing consensus there too. A good way to do that might be to talk more in depth about what we want to achieve and specifically the content of the metagovernment website that we have all been attracted to. I can understand people wanting to get stuck straight into software development but from my point of view I'd like to see us check our own assumptions first. It might take a little longer to do that but the solution(s) will be far more effective as a result.

In that regard a mailing list is probably sufficient right now. That said if we were upgraded to a forum which was also a mailing list, then we get all the benefits of the list and more for those that want them. And some of us will be champing at the bit to get their sleeves rolled up and do something practical that advances the cause. I think setting up a forum wouldn't do any harm in that respect. So long as it doesn't distract from our key priority of establishing our shared objectives, and providing we can retain the flexibility to move systems once we develop our ideas further.

I use the content management system Drupal because it is completely extensible, has some nice functions (inc basic forums) out of the box, very clean code, php/mysql based, but its also time consuming to learn at first. So I don't recommend it for our current needs but it may be ideal for us once were further down the track.

Most of the time I will be able to get back to emails in 72 hours but I'd prefer to keep it as an informal rule of thumb. There will always be times when we've got something useful to contribute but are away for a few days or we get a blinding flash of inspiration a even weeks after a discussion on the list and need to input our thoughts after a decision has been taken. Whether the decision is then changed or not is a matter to be discussed at the time and will depend on circumstances.

I don't mind if we adopted some aspects of traditional governence models until such time as we have created a system (or a part of the system) that is ready for us to transition to. Otherwise we could get lost in the black hole of trying to run the committee using a half baked system.

For me the big challenge we will have is uncovering and rising above the assumptions taken for granted in most of society, around leadership, command and control, getting things done, hierarchy, delegation and so on. There are some difficult balances to be struck, and trade-offs to be made. And I also don't think there is one single answer. We may need to invent an engine where the rules and weightings are completely customisable to the circumstances of the group that uses it.

Sorry for this diatribe, there's a lot to talk about!

Best,

Paul
