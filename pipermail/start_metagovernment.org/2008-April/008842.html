While I certainly couldn't argue over the math, I wonder if the old ways
might confuse the modern possibilities?

To explain: Newspapers print articles that are chosen by editors --
something we would agree to be less than Democratic. In this paradigm, a
more Democratic solution would be to require the newspaper to print articles
selected by the community. This solution would require the math to determine
which articles are printed in the paper.

But blogs do not exist in that paradigm. Blogs are usually edited by a small
group of writers who are directly affected by their readers -- a force which
affects the world around as it gains more popularity and influence. Back in
the real world we hear NPR placing popular blog editors on the radio next to
the PhD's who have studied the subject for decades.

When I think about the ancient definitions of Democracy -- including all the
edits up to modern day -- I wonder if we might be stuck determining the
number of editors for the same daily newspaper? If so, do blogs show us a
new way to think about Democracy in the 21st century?
