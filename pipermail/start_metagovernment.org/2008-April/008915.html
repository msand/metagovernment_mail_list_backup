<PRE>Many projects would not get off the ground without the investment in vision, enthusiasm, time and resources of one person (metagov included - thanks Ed). This typically cascades to a small group of the committed, then outward to some early supporters and adopters, then outward again to a larger group of trend setting public, and outward again to everyone else. 

While I have a natural aversion to some forms of hierarchy, I also have no desire to go against what seems to be a natural human dynamic (perhaps nothing to do with what is often perceived as hierarchy). I think we would benefit from recognising that in coal face implementations of metaGovs, it will often be the vision of 1 person that will energise a small group of committed people which will cause almost everything to happen.

I'm offering this more as a thought than a question - and hope it's pertinent.

Paul
