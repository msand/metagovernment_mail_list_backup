<PRE>&gt;<i> On this point, I would like to partially disagree. From what I

</I>&gt;<i> would like to suggest that synthesis can achieve a higher level of
</I>&gt;<i> consensus that any compromise. (I may be splitting hairs here, but I

</I>
You are! (splitting hairs that is) Synthesis, Compromise, don't give a
damn. We're clearly talking about the same thing and the synthesis
arguments are very close to my own descriptions of the ethical process.
What you're describing is &quot;merely&quot; a mechanism for rational debate. The
problem we have to face is that however rational the debate we will often
fail to agree. THAT is what the Pareto principle is about.

The Pareto principle is NOT about compromise or even agreement. It is
about setting a bottom line which ensures that, regardless of how many
gain,  no-one loses.  It is the condition under which those who continue
to dissent can reasonably be expected to tolerate the majority view and,
as such, is absolutely crucial to a fair implementation of the democratic
process.

The mechanical analog is the ratchet. You can move forward but you can't
slip back.
