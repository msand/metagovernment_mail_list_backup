<PRE>True - though if user votes are weighted by their approval rating
their votes are effectively representing the opinions of all those who
expressed approval of the user's other contributions

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This is a great concept. Although some of us, myself included, may think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that political parties are part of the problem rather than part of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; solution, if we come up with a solution which gives them power and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; influence, but (for once) in a genuinely democratic and over-ridable way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So if we can help groups of people connected by common
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ideologies(political
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; parties, pressure groups or whatever) to offer the public templates to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; their choices easier - WOW - that is a powerful solution (not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comproimise!).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not a big fan of this, and frankly quite scared, that this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; finding so much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approval. Although I'm not so naive to think we could get the clean break
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the old political parties that I would like, I wouldn't suggest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features to encourage the building of parties.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've already stated, that my main goal for this project is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political education
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of people, by giving them more responsibility for their government and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thereby
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting them to think. An &quot;autopilot button&quot; is something I'd rather not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What say should you have (directly or by delegating to a party), in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that you either don't care about, or don't understand enough to make a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision for yourself? If we encourage parties in this system, they will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inevitably have some populist tendencies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While I think we shouldn't go to far into examples, so we can stay focused
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the project, rather than sparking some unrelated controversy, I will offer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as an example of why it might not be such a good idea to have a &quot;socialist
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; button&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea of a minimum wage is something I would associate with socialism
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some economists would argue, is actually anti-social. This may or may not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; true, but how are we ever going to get people to think about it and do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own research, if we offer a feature to superficially judge the subject and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; choose a group to make the decision for them. I'm especially concerned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; groups with good intents, that appeal to the masses but without good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Superficially a party supporting minimum wage may feel like the right
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; choice, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are they really offering the right solution? It's hard to argue against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; giving
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; somebody barely enough to survive, especially, if you have to ask somebody
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spend an hour or two of their lives to even understand the argument you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to make. I'm not interested in making people feel good, if it has a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which is masked by propaganda.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As we say in Germany:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Gut gemeint ist nicht immer gut gemacht.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Well intended isn't always well executed.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Apart from that, the idea of building consensus and balkanizing a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seem kind of exclusionary and something we would want to stop if at all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible. The mentality in the community should be to find the best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; considering all proposals at hand, rather than fighting for one proposal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;own&quot; party, regardless of its merit.
