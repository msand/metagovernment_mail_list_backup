<PRE>When I first started working on a social network for my local community, I
learned two things:

1. My definition of social network wasn't any different than MySpace, and
2. My community had no idea why they should use the neighborhood website
instead of MySpace.

No amount of customization or additional features (calendars, security, et.
al) managed to change their perspective. The &quot;pie in the sky&quot; idea to
someday connect every voter to the mayor, every citizen to every law, every
tax to every payer -- didn't look any different than MySpace.

I decided that the problem started with No. 1. In order to build the
software, I needed to understand what I was building -- not from a &quot;software
perspective,&quot; but from the perspective of an &quot;Open Source Society.&quot; For this
reason, I believe that starting on the &quot;Good Book&quot; is essential to our own
beginnings.

If we're successful, we'll end up with something that is simple enough for
outsiders to understand, and should serve to keep us on track when we're
developing the actual application.
