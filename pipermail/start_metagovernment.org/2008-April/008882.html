<PRE>I believe it would be irresponsible for us to release &quot;political software&quot;
without the inclusion of parties.

As was mentioned previously, having political parties allows for a simple
transition into the world of &quot;Open Governance,&quot; while providing a solution
to those who believe that monitoring / voting for every law and regulation
would be too tedious for your average user.

However, I do understand your point of voter apathy -- simply doing whatever
the mainstream is doing -- but without it, I imagine that people would dream
of the days before Government got too damn complicated for anyone but the
&quot;next generation&quot; to comprehend.

To answer your concerns, it should be noted that people can join the
Democratic party and automatically vote along Democratic lines, however,
when there are issues that are of particular interest to the user that
aren't easily answered by the party, the user can change that particular
vote.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a great concept. Although some of us, myself included, may think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that political parties are part of the problem rather than part of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution, if we come up with a solution which gives them power and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; influence, but (for once) in a genuinely democratic and over-ridable way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So if we can help groups of people connected by common
</I>&gt;<i> ideologies(political
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parties, pressure groups or whatever) to offer the public templates to
</I>&gt;<i> make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their choices easier - WOW - that is a powerful solution (not
</I>&gt;<i> comproimise!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not a big fan of this, and frankly quite scared, that this is
</I>&gt;<i> finding so much
</I>&gt;<i> approval. Although I'm not so naive to think we could get the clean break
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> the old political parties that I would like, I wouldn't suggest
</I>&gt;<i> implementing
</I>&gt;<i> features to encourage the building of parties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've already stated, that my main goal for this project is the
</I>&gt;<i> political education
</I>&gt;<i> of people, by giving them more responsibility for their government and
</I>&gt;<i> thereby
</I>&gt;<i> getting them to think. An &quot;autopilot button&quot; is something I'd rather not
</I>&gt;<i> see.
</I>&gt;<i> What say should you have (directly or by delegating to a party), in
</I>&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;<i> that you either don't care about, or don't understand enough to make a
</I>&gt;<i> decision for yourself? If we encourage parties in this system, they will
</I>&gt;<i> inevitably have some populist tendencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I think we shouldn't go to far into examples, so we can stay focused
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> the project, rather than sparking some unrelated controversy, I will offer
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> as an example of why it might not be such a good idea to have a &quot;socialist
</I>&gt;<i> button&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> The idea of a minimum wage is something I would associate with socialism
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> some economists would argue, is actually anti-social. This may or may not
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> true, but how are we ever going to get people to think about it and do
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> own research, if we offer a feature to superficially judge the subject and
</I>&gt;<i> choose a group to make the decision for them. I'm especially concerned
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> groups with good intents, that appeal to the masses but without good
</I>&gt;<i> solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> Superficially a party supporting minimum wage may feel like the right
</I>&gt;<i> choice, but
</I>&gt;<i> are they really offering the right solution? It's hard to argue against
</I>&gt;<i> giving
</I>&gt;<i> somebody barely enough to survive, especially, if you have to ask somebody
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> spend an hour or two of their lives to even understand the argument you
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> trying to make. I'm not interested in making people feel good, if it has a
</I>&gt;<i> cost
</I>&gt;<i> which is masked by propaganda.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we say in Germany:
</I>&gt;<i> Gut gemeint ist nicht immer gut gemacht.
</I>&gt;<i> (Well intended isn't always well executed.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from that, the idea of building consensus and balkanizing a
</I>&gt;<i> community
</I>&gt;<i> seem kind of exclusionary and something we would want to stop if at all
</I>&gt;<i> possible. The mentality in the community should be to find the best
</I>&gt;<i> solution,
</I>&gt;<i> considering all proposals at hand, rather than fighting for one proposal
</I>&gt;<i> by the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;own&quot; party, regardless of its merit.
