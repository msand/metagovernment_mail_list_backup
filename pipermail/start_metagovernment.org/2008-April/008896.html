<PRE>I think we're starting to reach a synthesis here. Like Manuel, my  
initial reaction was to be very opposed to the idea of parties. But I  
like the way you are putting it here.

Again, if we are looking for an answer that is both simple and  
scalable, then the scoring system itself should be able to provide  
whatever functions parties may need.

In the government of a hockey team, the need for parties may never  
arise. In the government of a city's train system, there might be  
several parties with very different agendas. But someone who has no  
interest in the trains should not be allowed to just throw their  
weight behind a party because it is &quot;their party.&quot; They have to give  
it at least a little thought.

So, if a person cares enough about a community to want to have a say  
in it, but does not have the time to invest in active participation,  
they can lend their vote to another person. Perhaps they can just give  
that person a high score in the context of the city-train community.

This allows for actual leaders to develop, but not necessarily: people  
can give scores to whomever they want, or to multiple people. And at  
any time, they can change their score. So leaders exist only at the  
mercy of their supporters. The moment people think an individual is  
not representing their interests, they simply change their score and  
that person's power immediately dissolves.

And as an aside: if there are parties that develop to advance an  
agenda, each party itself will need its own governance... which might  
as well also be just another instance of Metascore. Or just another  
optional tag on each person's record.
