<PRE>Hello,
My name is Keyvan Fatehi, I am a freshman in college. I have been
studying (and engaging in) Business and I am eagerly motivated to
continue my studies in the field of Law thereafter. I have always
wished to be involved on the cutting edge (for example: technology,
which I see many of us are very much involved in). I believe this
concept of a metagovernment is very much a cutting edge and
revolutionary idea (which quite possibly makes its adoption /that/
much more difficult or improbable). However, it is not so radical as
we may think, it's transition is peaceful. All it takes is some common
sense... some publicity, some educated people. Any educated person
with an open mind (and who has not blinded his/herself to the bad side
of the current government) who takes the time to absorb himself into
the ideas put forward by this group in the future would be
hard-pressed not to get on board.
Thank you,
Keyvan
