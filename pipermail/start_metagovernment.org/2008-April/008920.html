<PRE>In organizing this project, originally I had thought that we could  
entirely eliminate the need for leaders. But as this discussion has  
developed, I have come to realize that leaders are not inherently  
bad... It is &quot;rulers&quot; with whom I have a problem.

After looking at the governance of the Debian project, I realize that  
it is only the sweeping power given to leaders that causes problems.  
In the system we have been talking about, a leader only has power for  
as long as they can maintain the support of the community.

And anyone can become a leader at any time. Either by building a good  
reputation within an existing governance system, or by creating a new  
one (running their own instance of metascore). Either way, it is up to  
the community to decide who if anyone to follow.

P.S. I am still on the road, trying to keep up from my phone. So my  
replies may be rather limited.
