Absolutely. I certainly have no desire to be in charge, and want very  
much for this committee to be the first to try this system. But until  
we have the code developed, we have to come up with a temporary  
solution. Fortunately, we are a small group, and hopefully use the  
&quot;consent and consensus&quot; model at first.

By that I mean that if one proposes something and nobody objects  
within a reasonable amount of time (maybe 72 hours?), then one can  
assume that the group consents and one can go ahead and act. If  
however someone takes issue with a proposition, then the group should  
work toward a consensus before taking action.

If anyone has better ideas for further structure, please chime in.

For the base code for Metascore, I have been looking at Vanilla  
bulletin board: <A HREF="http://www.getvanilla.com/">http://www.getvanilla.com/</A>
However I am not a programmer, and don't know if this is a good  
codebase. What other programmers have told me is that Vanilla is  
lightweight, flexible, and nimble, and that it's primary function is  
to be entirely extensible. Does that sound like a good starting point  
for building what will become Metascore, or could someone suggest  
other code, or should we start from scratch? The advantage of Vanilla  
is that we could get it set up pretty quickly and try to use it in  
place of this list.
