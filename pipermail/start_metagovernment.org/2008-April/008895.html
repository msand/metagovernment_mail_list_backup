There's no reason why we can't make this an option, for the community to 
decide on. Some communities may want to allow groups, and, even gives 
those groups more/less power than individuals. Other communities may 
not. Since its an open question, why don't we leave this up to the 
community? I don't think we can justify not supporting the option outright.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As mentioned previously, a person still has the option of identifying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves as a Republican, and changing their stance to Pro-Choice, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply change their vote when the time comes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ultimately, we're not taking their vote away from them, but simply making it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier for all of us Americans to remain attached to our sofas.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Who loves abortions? Who hates choice? Why are we so keen to give away the
</I>&gt;<i> power we now finally have the chance to exercise? Shouldn't Americans get
</I>&gt;<i> off their asses?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So many questions, I hardly know where to start.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I can certainly imagine groups being something practical, simply to
</I>&gt;<i> better understand what a whole group of people are thinking rather than
</I>&gt;<i> just keeping tabs on individuals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>From what I understand, you are implicitly proposing a voting system? I was
</I>&gt;<i> under the impression, this would be a last resort, that might justify everybody
</I>&gt;<i> actually casting their own vote rather than delegating it. I think we're all so
</I>&gt;<i> caught up in current day politics, we can hardly imagine a scenario where
</I>&gt;<i> consensus is the default and automatically go back to voting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Practically speaking, what kind of legislation in you're example would be
</I>&gt;<i> controversial? I can hardly imagine Republicans wanting to put women
</I>&gt;<i> who have had an abortion in jail. If you're not going to punish something
</I>&gt;<i> you want to make a crime, then what purpose does it serve to make it
</I>&gt;<i> illegal? As far as I can tell, this isn't a question of legislation, but a
</I>&gt;<i> reflection of a social divide in America, which politicians capitalize on in
</I>&gt;<i> their campaigns.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The topic wouldn't be nearly as controversial if, as Ed suggested in an
</I>&gt;<i> earlier post, the debate were centered around actual practical solutions,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than &quot;to which group do I belong?&quot;.
