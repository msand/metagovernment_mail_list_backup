<PRE>Hi St&#233;phane,

&gt;<i> I've been thinking a lot about a new society, and I think that having a
</I>&gt;<i> better voting system is a very important part of it.
</I>
A better voting system was my original idea too, but I think we have to
go a little bit further than that. The System I was thinking of would
let you cast your vote online, nut not only for candidates in an election,
but for every law that goes through parliament.

I dropped this Idea for various reasons, the main one being that voting
is actually not a good way to do democracy. Resolutions shouldn't be
produced, in which the majority can inflict its will on a minority. You
have to build consensus with the whole community. This is an important
distinction and one of the main reasons open source works. The Idea is
not to find out what the majority wants, but what everybody can agree
upon. Only in very rare cases should there need to be any formal
voting procedures.

I could go on, but Karl already said it much better than I ever could.

One important difference to voting in the traditional sense, is that it
isn't anonymous. This works in open source projects, because the group
is small enough, that everybody knows what the other thinks about a
proposal, since they have already expressed their opinions during
discussion.

I'll start a document entitled &quot;voting&quot; explaining some of the problems
it poses and how we may tackle them. In short, the hard part will be
doing voting in a massive non-anonymous fashion, which has implications
for discrimination and scalability, and doing in an anonymous fashion
but making sure everybody can trust the result.
Personally, I don't believe either of these can be solved completely
satisfactorily, but that may not be a bad thing, since it will be an
additional incentive to build consensus.

Manuel
