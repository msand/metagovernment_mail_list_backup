<PRE>(I would prefer to respond on the whiteboard, but I'll do my best with
text!)

Imagine the sign-in process where you verify your identity and you begin the
process of &quot;making the world a better place.&quot; While there are certainly
options to let you dive into the conversations and begin recording your
votes, I would like to focus on the idea of a &quot;setup wizard.&quot;

To start: You select those areas of particular interest to you. Maybe you DO
care about abortion and gay rights, or maybe you care more about education
and security. Your selections will bring those issues directly to you
without having to search the system.

Users may also select from a set of interests that are grouped along party
lines. For example, Republicans might choose Business and Financial issues,
Democrats might choose Women's and Children's Rights, while both might share
mutual interests.

After identifying your interests, the next screen determines your level of
activity. The yearly voter receives email messages when a community vote is
taking place. The monthly voter would receive a newsletter; the weekly
voter, a weekly update of activities, while the daily voter would see a
Digg-like stream of activities.

The next screen enables voters to align themselves with their political
party, or instead, vote independently on all issues. Those who align
themselves with a political party would receive their subscribed updates in
order to review and/or change their decisions accordingly. Independent
voters would be taken to one final screen.

The last screen displays the list of issues the user selected previously,
along with sliders and a check box. The sliders would move between strongly
support (++1) and strongly oppose (--1) with a 0 in the middle. The check
boxes would be set by default, and control whether or not the user prefers
to vote on the issues themselves.
