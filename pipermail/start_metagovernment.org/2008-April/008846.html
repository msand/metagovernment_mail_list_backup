<PRE>&gt;<i>  We're in imminent danger of veering off in different directions at
</I>&gt;<i>  different speeds. For example, I am clearly not on the same wavelength as
</I>&gt;<i>  Manuel. I indicated dissent yesterday at his IRC proposals but clearly
</I>&gt;<i>  misunderstood the context in which he made that proposal, for which I
</I>&gt;<i>  apologise.
</I>
Well maybe I'm assuming too much, normally the uses of IRC are pretty
clear in an OSS Project, so I probably didn't explain that enough.
In any case, it's good that it has been explicitly stated.

&gt;<i>  Essentially some of us are clearly rarin to go and want to dive right on
</I>&gt;<i>  into the coding. Others, including myself, are still at the stage of
</I>&gt;<i>  trying to get a clear image of what it is we are trying to achieve and
</I>&gt;<i>  why.
</I>
I have no intention of coding atm; I wouldn't even know where to start.
The main reason I'm proposing a repository isn't for code, but as a place
do document the goals you speak of. Posting to a mailing list is fine
for discussion, but eventually the goals should be somewhere in the
repository, so everybody can make additions and revisions.

Maybe I'm wrong, it could be appropriate to continue discussion, until
there is no real debate anymore. Eventually we will want to write down the
results of that debate. Once the goals are formulated in a way we can
all agree upon, we can start talking about implementation.
