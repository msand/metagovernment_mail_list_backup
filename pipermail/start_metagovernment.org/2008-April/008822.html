This is something I have been struggling to figure out. How important  
is geography? Stephane had written to me months ago suggesting that  
there should not be *any* clearly defined levels of government.

Most of us (including me) have been thinking in the scope of  
traditional levels of government, where there is a clear hierarchy  
based on geography: towns, cities, counties, provinces, nations.  
Instead, it may be better to think of every function of government as  
a separate community, which interacts with many other communities.

As an example, currently in my city there is a Parks Department. They  
are responsible for maintaining a network of city parks. That  
department is a community, and could be a &quot;government&quot; of the parks in  
this city. Additionally, each park is a community, so they can  
organize individually as governments. One park may have a gardening  
club associated with it, and that club can have its own government.

Maybe we need to we stop thinking of government as a broadly powerful  
authority over a territory, in charge of all order in that region.  
Instead, let us define government as the organizing principle of a  
community. Not only does that open up endless possibilities, it also  
allows shadow governments to be set up more easily because they only  
have to shadow one particular function of an existing government.

This means I would have to re-write a significant part of the current  
website. However, most of the writing will be *simplification.* By  
making a separate government for every community, we can get rid of  
the whole concept of &quot;topic areas&quot; (since a topic is a community). And  
we can allow online communities to be equal to geographic communities.

The thing I still can't figure out is how to satisfy the remaining  
need for geographically based government. People have disputes over  
land ownership, resource allocation, environmental protection,  
pollution, and other geographically specific things. How can self- 
defined communities have authority over these sorts of disputes?  
Couldn't two opposing communities have opposite laws in regard to the  
same piece of land? What if half the people want to all an oil well to  
be placed in their neighborhood, and half do not?
