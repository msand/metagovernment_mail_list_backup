<PRE>Question: If we're not 'voting' -- ie, if there is no tally of whether
a person agrees or dissents, how do we know when consensus is reached?

Does one have to propose an alternative in order to dissent?

And, if only 1 person of 2 million proposes an alternative, and all
others agree with the first proposal, is consensus reached?

I can see and agree with our not wanting a vote by majority, but
because these bills have real consequence and since most cannot be
undone easily, there needs to be formal criteria for &quot;consensus&quot;. This
is the main benefit of a vote -- it is unequivocal in its fairness
(hence its being the fallback for difficult disputes). I would be
interested to know how we determine consensus without some sort of
count (ie, vote) of something related to user activity (be it page
views, or counter-opinions).

</I>&gt;<i>  everybody can agree upon. Only in very rare cases should there need to be
</I>&gt;<i>  any formal voting procedures.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  This is one of the primary focusses of my own work. See for example

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Democracy means People Power, it does not mean &quot;Majority Rule&quot;, it means
</I>&gt;<i>  AT LEAST &quot;Majority Rule&quot; but that is very much a last resort to be adopted
</I>&gt;<i>  under two conditions only:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1 There is a consensus that a decision MUST be reached on the substantive
</I>&gt;<i>  issue but
</I>&gt;<i>  2 No consensus can be reached on that issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The example I give in my &quot;Democratic Cannibals&quot; story (second link above)
</I>&gt;<i>  is the decision on &quot;which side of the road should we drive&quot;. We cannot
</I>&gt;<i>  afford NOT to make a decision because that would produce carnage. But we
</I>&gt;<i>  might have a split within the community based on which side of the road
</I>&gt;<i>  our existing vehicles are designed to travel on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In such a case the &quot;fair&quot; solution is also the cheapest. i.e. to favour
</I>&gt;<i>  the majority but compensate the minority (who, presumably, will have to
</I>&gt;<i>  buy new cars or pay to have their cars adapted). i.e. the whole community
</I>&gt;<i>  bears the cost of ensuring that the minority don't suffer as a result of a
</I>&gt;<i>  decision by the majority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Essentially there is no ethical case for arguing that a minority should be
</I>&gt;<i>  forced or obliged to tolerate a decision by a majority which causes harm
</I>&gt;<i>  or cost to that minority. This imposes a form of ethical hierarchy or
</I>&gt;<i>  priority on the decision making process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  For example:
</I>&gt;<i>  The first aim - and ideal result - is to achieve true consensus - the
</I>&gt;<i>  complete absence of dissent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If that fails, the next decision has to be whether we still need a
</I>&gt;<i>  decision at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If no agreement can be reached on that, then the next question is
</I>&gt;<i>  restricted to those who are convinced a decision must be taken. Can they
</I>&gt;<i>  arrive at one which affects only themselves and excludes those who do not
</I>&gt;<i>  wish to be party to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If no such restricted decision is possible, do they agree between
</I>&gt;<i>  themselves that they must, nevertheless, seek to impose their decision on
</I>&gt;<i>  the dissenters (and do they have the means to do so?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Meanwhile the dissenters will be holding their own discussions about how
</I>&gt;<i>  much their dissent matters and whether imposition would force them to
</I>&gt;<i>  leave (or fight) the rest of the &quot;democratic&quot; group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In other words, voting is always a sign of failure to meet the initial
</I>&gt;<i>  ideal. And once we have dissent, the real issue - for the majority - is
</I>&gt;<i>  whether the issue is so important that it justifies overriding the dissent
</I>&gt;<i>  with measures ranging from compensation through to military force.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The Athenians recognized those basic rules and remain the only significant
</I>&gt;<i>  historical attempt to implement them. They failed partly because while
</I>&gt;<i>  they understood the need for consensus either on the issue or at least the
</I>&gt;<i>  need to reach a decision (voting never took place, under the Athenian
</I>&gt;<i>  system, if there wasn't a prior consensus that a decision was necessary)
</I>&gt;<i>  they didn't account for the sheeplike tendency of people to follow those
</I>&gt;<i>  who spoke forcefully or charismatically rather than those who spoke
</I>&gt;<i>  wisely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  It is that weakness in the original democratic model which I am most
</I>&gt;<i>  concerned to tackle. The web, fortunately, holds the solution, in that it
</I>&gt;<i>  provides a level playing field in which all contributions can be stripped
</I>&gt;<i>  of extraneous influences. Here, it need not matter what we look like or
</I>&gt;<i>  sound like, our ideas can stand or fall purely on the basis of their
</I>&gt;<i>  intrinsic merit. And we can present our arguments using whichever
</I>&gt;<i>  techniques best suit our abilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I for one like to take my time in debate. I will not participate, for
</I>&gt;<i>  instance, in the IRC channel that Manuel is suggesting - or any other real
</I>&gt;<i>  time chat. At least not on a serious issue. (Actually that was a strange
</I>&gt;<i>  suggestion from Manuel giving that he's also commented on the need to
</I>&gt;<i>  ensure accessibility to those with various disabilities - with which I
</I>&gt;<i>  agree)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I can - and will - take hours (sometimes days) to formulate my thoughts or
</I>&gt;<i>  responses and have no intention of being &quot;rushed&quot;!
