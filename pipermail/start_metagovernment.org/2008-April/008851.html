On this point, I would like to partially disagree. From what I  
understand of Pareto efficiency, it seeks the optimal compromise. I  
would like to suggest that synthesis can achieve a higher level of  
consensus that any compromise. (I may be splitting hairs here, but I  
think it is crucial to use the word &quot;synthesis&quot; as distinct from  
&quot;compromise.&quot;)

The difference I am making is in the definition of objectives in a  
conflict. When two conflicting sides compromise, neither one has  
changed their worldview: they simply came up with something which  
partially appeases each side. And that compromise can break down at  
any future time. However, when two conflicting sides synthesize their  
worldviews, both sides change for the better, and a more lasting  
resolution is achieved.

The most obvious example I can think of is the American debate over  
abortion, which is terribly divisive, but so easily open to synthesis.  
One side believes that abortion is wrong and should be outlawed; the  
other side believes that the government should not regulate  
individuals' bodies, and thus abortion should not be outlawed.

Neither side is really disagreeing on principles, only derivative  
actions. Almost everyone thinks abortion is undesirable, and almost  
everyone does not want the government to have control over their body.  
If the two sides could reach this understanding, they could easily  
synthesize. Instead of pouring their effort into each side of the  
dispute, they could spend the same amount of effort on trying to non- 
governmentally eliminate the societal motivations for abortion.

There are elements of compromise in that solution: the anti-abortion  
people have to deal with abortion being legal, and the anti-intrusion  
people have to increase their commitment to stopping abortion. But it  
is more than a compromise, because both sides have shifted their  
focus. Instead of focusing on the point of conflict, now both sides  
are focused on a deeper, more agreeable objective.

Additionally, neither side feels like they have gotten less than what  
their eventual goal is. Although abortion is legal, the anti-abortion  
people can take heart that their entire society is now dedicated to  
eliminating the causes of abortion. Isn't that their real objective  
anyway? And though they have to work on an issue that wasn't core to  
their political beliefs, the anti-intrusion people can take heart from  
the way things turned out. I am sure that most &quot;pro-choice&quot; people  
have personal reservations about the fact that they are, effectively,  
promoting abortion. If they could settle the government intrusion  
issue once and for all, I think that most of them would be happy to  
spend some time working against the social causes of abortion.
