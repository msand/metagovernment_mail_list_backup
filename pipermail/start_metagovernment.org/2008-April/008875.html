I think there should be a 'group' option -- where groups can organize 
themselves and optionally choose leaders whose votes as 'group votes' on 
particular issues -- given a scoring similar to that of individuals, 
weighted according to the size and popularity of the group. Also, groups 
should be able to govern themselves using the same software as the 
government. They can develop legislative proposals or position 
statements within the group, then open the statements for public 
comment. Also they should be able to limit which users can become 
members, but all people can 'approve' or 'disapprove' of the groups actions.

This could be something analogous to facebook groups -- perhaps we can 
interface with facebook to accomodate this??

</I>&gt;<i> This is a great concept. Although some of us, myself included, may

</I>&gt;<i> of the solution, if we come up with a solution which gives them power

</I>&gt;<i> over-ridable way (where the individual is the ultimate authority), 
</I>&gt;<i> this may help us win hearts and minds within the political status quo, 
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore make radically faster and better progress. I know a few 
</I>&gt;<i> politicians, former politicians, and political activists from across 
</I>&gt;<i> the UK political spectrum, and by and large they (the ones I know) are 
</I>&gt;<i> not in it for money, fame or corrupt power. For most of them, the task 
</I>&gt;<i> of serving as local councillors or MPs is sometimes a thankless task, 
</I>&gt;<i> getting criticism from all sides in return for considerable effort and 
</I>&gt;<i> personal investment over and above the call of duty.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> So if we can help groups of people connected by common 
</I>&gt;<i> ideologies(political parties, pressure groups or whatever) to offer 
</I>&gt;<i> the public templates to make their choices easier - WOW - that is a 
</I>&gt;<i> powerful solution (not comproimise!).
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It gives the status quo a way to engage in a meaningul way.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It harnesses the considerable volunteer effort and commitment 
</I>&gt;<i> typically made by political activists, and channels this into the 
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment way of doing things.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. *We may persuade the parties themselves to become metagovernment 
</I>&gt;<i> style organisations in their own right*, or to set up parallel 
</I>&gt;<i> organisations which work in this way. (in my view this one thing would 
</I>&gt;<i> have a dramitic and positive effect ).
</I>&gt;<i> 4. It doesn't throw the baby out with the bathwater (there are some 
</I>&gt;<i> benefits to our current system even if the system as a whole is broken).
</I>&gt;<i> 5. *It makes the job of citizen engagement as easy as it is 
</I>&gt;<i> currently*. ie for people that just want to vote once every 5 years - 
</I>&gt;<i> they can subscribe to a template maintained by their favourite 
</I>&gt;<i> political movement.
</I>&gt;<i> 6. ...But at any time they can delve deeper into the source-code to 
</I>&gt;<i> debate or over-ride the party settings, and preferences, on a 
</I>&gt;<i> particular issue or suite of issues.
