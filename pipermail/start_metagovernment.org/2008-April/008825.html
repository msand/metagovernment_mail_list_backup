<PRE>&gt;<i>  The Athenians recognized those basic rules and remain the only significant
</I>&gt;<i>  historical attempt to implement them.
</I>
Wow, I guess the middle ages threw us back more than I thought.

&gt;<i>  I for one like to take my time in debate. I will not participate, for
</I>&gt;<i>  instance, in the IRC channel that Manuel is suggesting - or any other real
</I>&gt;<i>  time chat. At least not on a serious issue.
</I>
I'm not suggesting anything else. IRC should always be treated as an
informal medium. Technical help or an unimportant dialog are more suited
to an interactive medium, you don't need to bother the entire community
with unimportant chitchat. Since that sort of dialog is also important for
a community, I was proposing an option that might accommodate those
wishes.

All decisions and important discussions must of course be kept on the
mailing list and if something important is discussed on IRC a transcript
must be posted to the mailing list, since that is the only place we can
trust everybody will have a chance to voice their opinions.

&gt;<i>  (Actually that was a strange
</I>&gt;<i>  suggestion from Manuel giving that he's also commented on the need to
</I>&gt;<i>  ensure accessibility to those with various disabilities - with which I
</I>&gt;<i>  agree)
</I>
IRC is an open protocol, from the perspective of the user, plain and simple
text. There are chat clients for terminals, so anybody who can read text from
a terminal can, participate in those discussions.
You are of course to the extent correct that the disability of a person might
prohibit somebody with condition like Lou Gehrig's Disease to effectively
participate, even if it is in principle possible. Since we don't want
to do without
the contributions of the next Stephen Hawking, the kind of conversations on
IRC are restricted accordingly.

Manuel
