That's very clever. I have used a lot of open source software in my  
I.T. career, but I admit I have had very little involvement on the  
back end. That sounds like a great way to protect the code.

Though shouldn't the sourceforge repository have something? It is  
after all the most obvious place for people to look, and right now it  
looks empty.

Also, I should mention that in addition to the sourceforge project,  
the metagovernment.org site is on a full-service hosting account, so  
we are free to set up whatever software/databases we want there. I do  
like the idea of distributing, but at the very outset we might want to  
work toward some sort of unity.
