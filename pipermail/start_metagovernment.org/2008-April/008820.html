<PRE>The Australian government (among others -- namely, Switzerland and the
UK) have experimented with eDemocracy with some success. Whether or
not we want a shadow-government, we might do well to review their
experience as it will likely prove instructive in our site design if
not our philosophy.

See, here, an analysis:
<A HREF="http://dowire.org/wiki/Queensland%27s_E-democracy_Leadership">http://dowire.org/wiki/Queensland%27s_E-democracy_Leadership</A>

The good news is, (1) there was overwhelming support from the people
for the project and (2) citizens did participate to good effect, the
(3) legislators and councillors described 'significant benefits' from
the project. Problems cited include lack of participation due to poor
site location on the web and technical issues (performance and
privacy/authentication concerns).

Something to think about.
