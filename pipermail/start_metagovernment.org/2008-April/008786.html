<PRE>I've set up an initial repository at home. I don't want to give the
impression to be eager to start development of any software. The main
objective at the moment is of course gaining consensus about our
goals, and a common repository with documents we can refer to, which
describe these objectives, will be helpful.

I also don't want to force a particular VCS upon anybody, it's just
not very hard to set up, so I went ahead with it. This is just so you
can see for yourself, how easy/hard the software is to use and get a
better impression.

<A HREF="http://mbarkhau.dyndns.org/">http://mbarkhau.dyndns.org/</A>

You can clone the repository with &quot;hg clone
<A HREF="http://mbarkhau.dyndns.org/">http://mbarkhau.dyndns.org/</A>&quot; and later update via &quot;hg pull&quot;. From
there you have you're own version of the repository to work in and
commit to.

Sharing you're changes is a little more complicated, and depends on
the development model we decide to use.
You can either submit patches, produced with the &quot;hg export&quot; command,
which anybody may decide to apply to their repository, or you can
publish your repository with &quot;hg serve&quot; and announce the url or ip
address of you're repository. Anybody who likes your changes, can then
merge them into their own branch.
