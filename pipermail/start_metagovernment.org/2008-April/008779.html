<PRE>Greetings all

My main experience in politics is as a full time trade union activist in
the UK Civil Service for 7 years and as a campaigner for electoral reform
from the mid 70's to the early 90s (when I realised how limited an
objective that was).

As an aspiring philosopher I've put most of my effort into my main website
(www.fullmoon.nu) where you will find most of my musings on Democracy,
Anarchism etc. I am also heavily involved in trying to promote a &quot;third
way&quot; in respective of the Surveillance society in which I advocate what I
call &quot;Trusted Surveillance&quot; one of whose stated aims is the abolition of
government in the centralised autocratic form which we currently suffer.

My main &quot;techno-political&quot; interests lie in how we achieve and maintain
good security whilst improving and maintaining very high standards of
privacy and liberty in the conduct of our everyday lives. I am a
passionate defender of the right to anonymity which I believe can be
offered without sacrificing accountability.

Like others on the list I am self employed as an IT consultant. My bread
and butter comes from the sales and support of a business management
program which I first wrote 15 years ago and find myself still writing. I
am also the technical director of a small startup called Codel
(www.codelmark.com) which is seeking to exploit a couple of ideas of mine
for which we've recently been awarded patents.

Seems to me that none of us are afraid of the scale of our ambition, so
now it's a question of whether and how we can deliver.

The major technical issue seems to be the scalability which others have
mentioned. The major issue of principle, for me, is how we achieve the
intelligent structuring of debate.

Regards

Harry Stottle
