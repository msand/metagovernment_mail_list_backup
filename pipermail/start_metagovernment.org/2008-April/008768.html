<PRE>Hello, and thank you for joining the Metagovernment startup committee.  
There are eleven people in this initial group. For now, the archives  
of this list server will be password-protected for access by members  
only. However, in the interest of transparency, the archives will  
likely become publicly available when the project is fully established  
(or whenever this group decides to do so).

I am sure that you are each aware that this project is almost absurdly  
ambitious: attempting to implement a new form of human governance.  
However, there is every reason to believe that this project can  
succeed: its principles of openness, inclusion, and synthesis all work  
to feed its development. It does not need power or money or fame to  
succeed; it just needs a little help to get it started.

All of us have been thinking about the future of online governance,  
and have come up with similar but unique ways of addressing this  
concept. Many of the members of this committee have already begun  
similar projects, and are in various stages of theorization or  
development. I am delighted that you each have decided to participate  
in the Metagovernment project, as I believe it is a great point of  
coordination for the people here. For all I know, we might all decide  
to work on a different project, but I would like to point out some of  
the assets that this project has already accumulated:

- The metagovernment.org (and .com) domain.
- A 1+ year-old website, well indexed by search engines.
- Links from seven English Wikipedia articles (that is quite  
significant).
- A borderless/nationless structure, allowing this project to scale to  
any size.
- The claim to power (&quot;fiat&quot;), designed to be a sort of self- 
fulfilling prophesy.
- This group, which is small, but whose members are all quite  
exceptional.

I have prepared a short list of next steps this project needs to  
address in order to get started, but I will hold off on sending it for  
a while until we get an idea of who we are. (But FYI, at the top of  
the list is how this project should govern itself.)

For now, please send a brief introduction of yourself to the group. Do  
please try to be brief in order to allow us all to read all of each  
other's intros. I will send my personal intro immediately following  
this message, and you can use that as a guide for yours. Please start  
a new message with the subject &quot;Intro: Your Name&quot; for clarity's sake.

One final note. It is important to stress right at the beginning that  
this project must be unbiased and non-partisan. Practically all  
political beliefs are to be accommodated by this project, and it would  
be counterproductive for this group to take any partisan stance. The  
only political philosophy actively advocated by this group should be  
that which is consistent with the Basic Principles as stated on the  
website, particularly the principles of openness and inclusion.

Thank you again, and I look forward to working with you.


</PRE>
