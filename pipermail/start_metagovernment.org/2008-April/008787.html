<PRE>&gt;<i> For me the big challenge we will have is uncovering and rising above the
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions taken for granted in most of society, around leadership, command
</I>&gt;<i> and control, getting things done, hierarchy, delegation and so on. There are
</I>&gt;<i> some difficult balances to be struck, and trade-offs to be made. And I also
</I>&gt;<i> don't think there is one single answer.
</I>
I second that, to the extent that good documentation of different governance
models that the software will enable, will be the most important outcome of
this project, rather than the software itself.

As a programmer, I look at writing up program code in an open source project,
to be comparable to writing legal code and resolutions. Under that assumption,
basically any community has the ability, right this very moment, to adopt an
open source government model with the tools that are available today. How well
that will scale, is a different matter entirely, since most oss (open source
software) projects have a fairly small development community, where everybody
knows each other.

This is obviously won't work with hundreds of people wanting to talk about one
fairly small but important resolution. The main difference and cause for this,
is that during software development, the amount of people, capable of
understanding the code and thus eager to discuss it, is much smaller, because
program code is (mostly) harder to understand than legal code. Not as many
members of the community will want to put in the effort to understand the code,
most will in fact be perfectly content, seeing that the unit tests pass and
trusting the implementation is correct.

A community producing resolutions doesn't have this luxury. Many more people
can not only understand the code, but are affected by it, and thus will want to
participate in the discussion. One great danger here is the development of
discussions about the colour of the bikeshed.

Another difference we have to take into account, is that people who are
interested in oss come to the projects they like. There is an automatic self
selection of the members of the community and you rarely have to deal with
&quot;difficult people&quot;, because they leave before they can do much harm.

Taking all this into consideration, apart from the software itself, we
should produce a &quot;Citizens Guide to an Open Community&quot;. You can't build
software and hand it over to people, expecting them to know how to use
it correctly. Especially not if the most important aspect of the
software isn't how it actually works, but what it's users produce with
it. Although I'm reluctant to apply the term programming here; we're not
only programming software, but also the people who use it. People will
need a guide to introduce them to working in a community.

A great advantage of such a document is not simply the codification of
procedures in the community, so people will read it and use it as a
guideline. With such a document, people have place to point at, when
somebody is stepping out of line.

I should mention that such a document is itself, not a set of laws which
the community abides by when they interact with each other, but merely
a documentation of the rules by which they have informally agreed upon.
They can change it at any time if it doesn't reflect reality.

This is in fact my main motivation for this project. If better laws and
resolutions are produced, by a community that uses our software, that
will be secondary to the education, which the community receives, about
how society can work.

If we are honest with ourselves, in terms of our political development,
we could consider ourselves to be juveniles. We complain like kids with
tyrannical parents, not even considering why certain decisions are made,
only seeing the immediate negative effects on ourselves. I attribute
this mainly to our inability to produce the laws we abide by. If we are
the producers and editors of those laws, in order to make informed
decisions, we will actually have to inform ourselves.

This self education and the dialog among citizens will in my opinion,
have a far greater positive effect on society than any resolutions, they
could ever pass.

Oh god, sorry for preaching, I got carried away.

Manuel
