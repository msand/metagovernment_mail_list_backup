I agree that this model should be able to scale to any organization.  
Instead of having one person responsible for all the important  
decisions, organizations can distribute the process to the people who  
wish to have a say on any particular decision. That organization could  
be a township, a corporation, or a rock band's fan club. They all need  
governance of some kind, and this method of governance should appeal  
to any organization that would benefit from increased participation by  
its members.

Since this sort of participation is inherently internet-based, and  
since the internet is global, I then begin to wonder why we need  
nations at all. The historical functions of nations have been to  
divide/separate people and to concentrate power in leaders. Neither of  
those functions seems consistent with this project, and now that we do  
have a budding global community, I cannot see why we would want to  
keep these archaic institutions alive.

However, I understand that the concept of a nationless world is  
radical, and I am not saying it should be a direct goal of this  
project. I think it is appropriate that this project focus on small  
communities first. But once it is established in the lower levels, I  
want us to keep in mind that we need not necessarily implement this in  
nations. The open community governments may be able to simply make the  
nations go away.
