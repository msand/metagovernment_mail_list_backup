<PRE>All the college talk reminded me of a project at the University of
Pennsylvania which attempts to accomplish what you described.

www.I-neighbors.org primarily focuses on the social networking aspects of a
local community, but does include the unique ability to send faxes to your
local government officials. Unfortunately, the project seems to ebb and flow
with the course listings, and the information seems limited to their own
data.

What I like most about the 'meta' in Metagovernment is that it implies that
nobody owns any particular information, that it flows from one point to
another without being trapped in a remote database.

&gt;<i> Hi .. wanted to introduce myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm the director of data management at an academic clinical research
</I>&gt;<i> organization at Harvard Med School in Boston.  I administrate MySQL
</I>&gt;<i> databases and oversee the management of clinical trial data, but more
</I>&gt;<i> importantly I have developed an electronic data collection and trial
</I>&gt;<i> management application using VB, S and Java.  I also develop and
</I>&gt;<i> maintain a few clinical-research-related websites which collect and
</I>&gt;<i> distribute research findings (videos, slides, a journal, and news),
</I>&gt;<i> and to maintain ongoing trials. I primarily work in PHP, Java and
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have to say, I'm very, very excited about the project. Living in the
</I>&gt;<i> US, it's clear to me that a purely representative government has its
</I>&gt;<i> limitations. I contacted Ed soon after a discussion with some
</I>&gt;<i> colleagues in which I proposed a &quot;shadow-government&quot; website, that
</I>&gt;<i> would give citizens the tools to stay informed of their government's
</I>&gt;<i> actions and to better interact with the existing representative
</I>&gt;<i> structure. Essentially, the tool set would be the same as that
</I>&gt;<i> proposed by the metagovernment site, but it would be pulling its data
</I>&gt;<i> from the various existing legislative bodies in order to improve
</I>&gt;<i> legislative transparency and allow all citizens to vote, comment, and
</I>&gt;<i> modify/propose new legislation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One could see this as a possible first-step in the transition towards
</I>&gt;<i> a more pure metagovernment vision, where citizen votes on the site
</I>&gt;<i> have consequence beyond expressing public opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully this helps to give an idea of where I'm coming from -- it
</I>&gt;<i> seems we have an ambitious team here with lots of great ideas ..  I
</I>&gt;<i> look forward to getting started!
