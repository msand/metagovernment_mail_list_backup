<PRE>I couldn't agree more -- the benefits of a metagovernment would be
complete transparency and the participation of all in the legislative
process. Since the advent of television, public debates are more about
personalities than they are about issues and ideas -- I feel that the
internet can have an opposite effect of similar magnitude, and has to
some extent with the rise of political blogs, but most of its
potential has yet to be realized.

I would argue that a successful partnership with legislative bodies
and with educational institutions (once the site is built) would help
to stem this problem of the ebb and flow of content -- irrespective of
whether the application is meant to supplement or replace the existing
government. To successfully supplement the government, it would have
to be capable of replacing it. Otherwise, all you have is a fancy
political blog. The capacity to replace the government empowers the
users in a way that would otherwise not be felt -- it becomes a &quot;what
if we were in charge&quot; kind of experiment rather than a mere forum of
opinion. Hence, my excitement over the metagovernment project.

I say this in order to communicate that I am personally committed to
the development of the metagovernment, and, to introduce the idea that
voter apathy might be a concern.  Wikipedia has only a small number of
users who contribute content though very many enjoy its benefits. In
designing the software, we should ensure that participation is as easy
and straightforward as possible.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi .. wanted to introduce myself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm the director of data management at an academic clinical research
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organization at Harvard Med School in Boston.  I administrate MySQL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; databases and oversee the management of clinical trial data, but more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; importantly I have developed an electronic data collection and trial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; management application using VB, S and Java.  I also develop and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintain a few clinical-research-related websites which collect and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distribute research findings (videos, slides, a journal, and news),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and to maintain ongoing trials. I primarily work in PHP, Java and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MySQL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have to say, I'm very, very excited about the project. Living in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; US, it's clear to me that a purely representative government has its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; limitations. I contacted Ed soon after a discussion with some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; colleagues in which I proposed a &quot;shadow-government&quot; website, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would give citizens the tools to stay informed of their government's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actions and to better interact with the existing representative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structure. Essentially, the tool set would be the same as that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposed by the metagovernment site, but it would be pulling its data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the various existing legislative bodies in order to improve
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legislative transparency and allow all citizens to vote, comment, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modify/propose new legislation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One could see this as a possible first-step in the transition towards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a more pure metagovernment vision, where citizen votes on the site
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have consequence beyond expressing public opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hopefully this helps to give an idea of where I'm coming from -- it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems we have an ambitious team here with lots of great ideas ..  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; look forward to getting started!
