<PRE>Before we get too far down any particular discussion (keeping in mind  
several people haven't even introduced themselves yet), I would like  
to try to list what tasks are most pressing at the moment.

We will likely need to form some subgroups, and then we may find that  
different forms of communication may be needed for each. I chose a  
list server for the umbrella group as a starting point for us to get  
to know each other. I think it is the right form for now for the  
startup committee, but that when we dig into details, we're going to  
want some sort of web-based repository (forum, wiki, etc.).

That said, these are the major outstanding tasks I had identified so  
far. Many of the tasks are dependent on each other, so it gets a  
little tricky trying to identify what to address first.

Project governance
- How to manage this group and other initial projects before Metascore.
- How projects will be administered in the future (we will always need  
SourceForge administrators, I.T. administrators, etc.). Can  
bureaucratic tasks such as I.T. administration be run in the context  
of Metascore, or will we still need individuals to be in charge? If  
the latter, how do we control for corruption in those individuals?

Non-Profit Foundations
- Which formal organizations need to be formed? This will be relevant  
when we want to take monetary donations. Should Metagovernment and  
Metascore have separate organizations...?
- What nation to form in? Looking for the best host for our  
organizations. I am based in the United States and doubt that it is  
our best choice.
- What kind of entity to form as (depends on the above).

Software
- Basic form of the software - What is the interface and basic  
presentation?
- Develop the math - Must provide balance, and must control for  
negatives (one major negative remains unresolved: how to control the  
formation of cliques, where a group of people all collaborate to give  
each other good scores, thus gaming the system)
- Codebase - Can we adapt existing software (perhaps Vanilla BB)? If  
not, what language/database (etc.) to use?
- Failsafes - How to deal with hackers, malicious ISPs, and other  
technological threats to the underlying systems?
- Project plan - Develop timeline and give assignments.

Current site
- Implement discussion board for broad public input? Suggest having  
one message thread for each minor section of the current site's home  
page (and of the FAQ page). Tentative plan is to use Vanilla because  
it is simple and extensible... however that means is must be extended  
to be practical.
- Moderators will be needed for that board, since we won't have a  
scoring system yet.
