<PRE>I agree that the logs aren't perfect, but it's a start. Some sort of 
'under the hood' assurance would also help. One way to solve the phantom 
user problem may be to provide a link from the logs to contact a user -- 
this would make the illusion of a phantom user more difficult to 
maintain. More difficult to enforce would be a one-account-per-user 
policy .. to prevent one person from creating 20+ user accounts.

Regarding the question of user security, I don't think any amount of 
security would be too much .. the US recently discussed implementing 
traditional voting (to repeat democratic primaries in FL) but abandoned 
the idea due to security concerns.
