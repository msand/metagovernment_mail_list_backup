Consider that I, as an average netizen, could host a mirror of wikipedia
with minimal effort, and I could choose to fully or partially update my
wikipedia mirror from the one at wikipedia.org and from each of the other
mirrors - and just the same, each other mirror, including the one at
wikipedia.org, could decide to update some or all of the changes done on my
copy.

Suddenly, there IS no authoritative source any more - just the version each
person maintains, with the changes he accepts.

</I>&gt;<i> (especially to non-nerds), and I find it's presentation to be too
