<PRE>Each governing body has a scope defined by the governing body that
granted it the authority to govern, so ultimately there is one
'government' -- composed of many governing bodies. Example, the US
constitution grants US states the rights to govern particular aspects
of society within their borders. Likewise, the US states granted the
federal government the authority to govern according to the US
constitution.

Sometimes, the scopes overlap -- and for a while this may create a bit
of chaos since there is either a lack of accountability (neither
governing body assumes authority since neither wants responsibility)
or both assume authority and there is obvious conflict. Example, this
happens in the US where the CIA and the FBI struggle over which agency
is responsible for monitoring the threat of domestic terrorism. Like
the 'democracy by consensus' model, this either resolves itself or it
comes to a vote -- a new law defining the roles of each agency is
passed by the parliament.

It would seem that, initially, a governing body would need to be
established with a some sort of scope or mandate .. but, that scope is
then realized according to how effectively the governing body is able
to govern vis-a-vis the other governing bodies with similar scope. If
it doesn't govern well in a particular area, another governing body
may take over the responsibility.. if none does and an egregious gap
exists, then a new governing body would have to be proposed in order
to govern as needed.

This would imply that a hybrid meta-government / traditional
parliamentary system may be possible...  where some governing bodies
are run by metagovernment and others by elected representatives.

thoughts?

</I>&gt;<i>  This is something I have been struggling to figure out. How important

</I>&gt;<i>  there should not be *any* clearly defined levels of government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Most of us (including me) have been thinking in the scope of
</I>&gt;<i>  traditional levels of government, where there is a clear hierarchy
</I>&gt;<i>  based on geography: towns, cities, counties, provinces, nations.
</I>&gt;<i>  Instead, it may be better to think of every function of government as
</I>&gt;<i>  a separate community, which interacts with many other communities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  As an example, currently in my city there is a Parks Department. They
</I>&gt;<i>  are responsible for maintaining a network of city parks. That
</I>&gt;<i>  department is a community, and could be a &quot;government&quot; of the parks in
</I>&gt;<i>  this city. Additionally, each park is a community, so they can
</I>&gt;<i>  organize individually as governments. One park may have a gardening
</I>&gt;<i>  club associated with it, and that club can have its own government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Maybe we need to we stop thinking of government as a broadly powerful
</I>&gt;<i>  authority over a territory, in charge of all order in that region.
</I>&gt;<i>  Instead, let us define government as the organizing principle of a
</I>&gt;<i>  community. Not only does that open up endless possibilities, it also
</I>&gt;<i>  allows shadow governments to be set up more easily because they only
</I>&gt;<i>  have to shadow one particular function of an existing government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  This means I would have to re-write a significant part of the current
</I>&gt;<i>  website. However, most of the writing will be *simplification.* By
</I>&gt;<i>  making a separate government for every community, we can get rid of
</I>&gt;<i>  the whole concept of &quot;topic areas&quot; (since a topic is a community). And
</I>&gt;<i>  we can allow online communities to be equal to geographic communities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The thing I still can't figure out is how to satisfy the remaining
</I>&gt;<i>  need for geographically based government. People have disputes over
</I>&gt;<i>  land ownership, resource allocation, environmental protection,
</I>&gt;<i>  pollution, and other geographically specific things. How can self-
</I>&gt;<i>  defined communities have authority over these sorts of disputes?
</I>&gt;<i>  Couldn't two opposing communities have opposite laws in regard to the
</I>&gt;<i>  same piece of land? What if half the people want to all an oil well to
</I>&gt;<i>  be placed in their neighborhood, and half do not?
