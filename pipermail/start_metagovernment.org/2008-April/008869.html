<PRE>&gt;<i> They still have clearly-defined leaders,
</I>
True however, from the article
&quot;The authors' examination of the emergence of a governance system in
an open source software community shows how a community uses a formal
bureaucratic basis of authority to reinforce the community's
meritocratic norms.

However, this approach depends upon democratic mechanisms that not
only limit that basis of authority, but allows the system to adapt
with members' changing interpretation of leadership.&quot;

&gt;<i>  which I think we can avoid by using open content
</I>&gt;<i>  systems. And, of course, they aren't built to be
</I>&gt;<i>  simultaneously scaled to handle every community at once.
</I>
Right, but the nature of their project doesn't require it most of the
time. If I recall correctly, they had a fairly large debate
about the project leader recently, it would be interesting to
see how structured the debate was and how a system like
ours might have helped.

Also interesting &quot;..unlike online communities, production communities
must integrate individual contributions into a common pool, which can
heighten interdependencies and the need for coordination mechanisms. &quot;

Certainly something we should look into.

On the not so bright side: &quot;Organizations without a consensual basis
of authority lack an important condition necessary for their survival.
Those with directly democratic forms of participation do not tend to
scale well and are noted for their difficulty managing complexity and
decision-making &#8211; all of which can hasten their demise.&quot;

Which is essentially the challenge we're facing with our
implementation. Before I quote the article whole, I suppose I should
leave a reason to read it for yourselves, well worth the read.

On a more important note; these are the kind of people, we should seek
input from. While I think we currently have enough traffic on the list
to follow as it is, we should be aware that keeping it closed, bars us
from feedback from these people.
