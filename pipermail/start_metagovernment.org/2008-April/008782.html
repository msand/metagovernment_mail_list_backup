<PRE>I agree, mailing lists are 90's, its best we get the site up ASAP and
continue our discussions there in a much more organized manner
(Forum).

Vanilla looks good, I'm not personally familiar with it, but it looks
nice, clean, and professional so far (<A HREF="http://lussumo.com/community/">http://lussumo.com/community/</A>)
&lt;-- example

vbulletin and phpbb are also popular options. I don't believe
vbulletin is free, but phpbb is free (Vanilla is also free)...

Ed Pastore, I call vanilla.

</I>&gt;<i>  Absolutely. I certainly have no desire to be in charge, and want very
</I>&gt;<i>  much for this committee to be the first to try this system. But until
</I>&gt;<i>  we have the code developed, we have to come up with a temporary
</I>&gt;<i>  solution. Fortunately, we are a small group, and hopefully use the
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;consent and consensus&quot; model at first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  By that I mean that if one proposes something and nobody objects
</I>&gt;<i>  within a reasonable amount of time (maybe 72 hours?), then one can
</I>&gt;<i>  assume that the group consents and one can go ahead and act. If
</I>&gt;<i>  however someone takes issue with a proposition, then the group should
</I>&gt;<i>  work toward a consensus before taking action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If anyone has better ideas for further structure, please chime in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  For the base code for Metascore, I have been looking at Vanilla
</I>&gt;<i>  bulletin board: <A HREF="http://www.getvanilla.com/">http://www.getvanilla.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  However I am not a programmer, and don't know if this is a good
</I>&gt;<i>  codebase. What other programmers have told me is that Vanilla is
</I>&gt;<i>  lightweight, flexible, and nimble, and that it's primary function is
</I>&gt;<i>  to be entirely extensible. Does that sound like a good starting point
</I>&gt;<i>  for building what will become Metascore, or could someone suggest
</I>&gt;<i>  other code, or should we start from scratch? The advantage of Vanilla
</I>&gt;<i>  is that we could get it set up pretty quickly and try to use it in
</I>&gt;<i>  place of this list.
