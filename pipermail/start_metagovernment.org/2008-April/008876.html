<PRE>As a side-note, I would like let you know some details about this list  
server, this group, and other such administrative aspects.

Everyone who wrote to any of the contact addresses for Metascore or  
Metagovernment was invited to join this list. Ten people asked to be  
added to this list (plus myself). For your convenience, here is a list  
of the members of the group, using the information you each provided  
in your introduction (in order of introduction on the list):

NAME - ORIGIN - EXPERIENCE/AREAS OF FOCUS

Ed Pastore - United States - I.T., Web Development, Philosophy
Manuel Barkhau - Ireland (residing in Germany) - Computer Science  
Student
Ra&#250;l D&#237;az Fern&#225;ndez - Chile - I.T., Programming
Keyvan Fatehi - undisclosed - Business Student
Paul Codd-MacDonald - Scotland - Management Science (and Engineering)
Christopher Ritter - United States - Software Design
Danijel Mulugeta - undisclosed - undisclosed
Harry Stottle - UK? - I.T., Activism, Philosophy, Business Management
Jacki Buros - United States - Data Management, Programming, Web  
Development
St&#233;phane Bersier - Switzerland (residing in Canada) - Math/CS Student
Aur Saraf - Israel? - Programming, Mechanical Engineering Student

(Please correct any of the above if you wish.)

This is a wonderfully diverse group. I would like to remind the native  
English speakers that not everyone here is necessarily fully fluent in  
English. And also, for those people whose first language is not  
English, please tell us if we are using terminology or grammar that is  
difficult to follow.

Also, if you have not participated much so far, do not let that  
prevent you from future participation. I am sure we all are quite busy  
and our participation will vary over time. And please note that we are  
distributed through several time zones, which also will affect  
participation.

And for the students on the list, please do not feel intimidated by  
the significant levels of experience of some of the other members.  
These ideas we are exploring are so new that we are all equal in our  
understanding of them. And in some respects, the younger you are, the  
better prepared you are to grasp some of these ideas, since you have  
grown up in a much more connected world than older people.

Currently this list server is closed. This was a difficult decision on  
my part, because transparency is a fundamental component of this  
project. However, I felt that closing the list was necessary for the  
initial group for two reasons. First, simply because it is a list  
server, and running a completely open list server is not advisable.  
When we switch to a different format, this reason will go away. (But  
for now, Manuel, this means that the address you list on your  
repository should be the Contact address, not the Start one.)

The second reason to close the list was to temporarily protect the  
identity of members of the group. If this project suddenly gains  
notoriety, some of the people/groups who hold enormous amounts of  
power under the current system may feel that we are a threat to them.  
Until the project has enough momentum to be self-sustaining, I feel it  
is prudent to afford us a small amount of privacy.

As I had noted previously, at some point we will want to open up the  
archives of this list, providing transparency and allowing people to  
see how we came upon the decisions we have made. The closing is just a  
temporary startup measure. But I expect this list will remain closed  
until we switch to another format. In case you haven't looked, the  
archives are here (and require your password provided with your  
initial subscription):
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/private/start_metagovernment.org/">http://metagovernment.org/mailman/private/start_metagovernment.org/</A>

Currently, I am the only person using a metagovernment.org e-mail  
address. If any of you would like one (or a metascore.org address),  
please just let me know. You can have a full IMAP/POP account, or I  
can just set up a forward.

Both domains are being hosted on asmallorange.com, which is based in  
Canada. I currently have the smallest full-service hosting account. It  
is not as huge as the cheap hosting accounts available from bluehost,  
etc., but asmallorange is more reliable (and I like that they are  
based in Canada, which affords more liberty than many other nations).  
The current Metagovernment and Metascore sites are somewhat optimized  
for minimal data transfer, so that we can withstand a *lot* of hits  
without approaching our bandwidth limits.

I have spoken to fused.net about hosting the project, as they  
sometimes host open source projects for free (they too are in Canada,  
I believe). They were quite interested, but want to see us make some  
progress first. Once we have a solid code development plan and  
timeline, they will consider us for hosting. For background on them,  
see:

Please tell me if there are other details such as the above which you  
think I should share with the group.
