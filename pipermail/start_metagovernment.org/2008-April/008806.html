Could you (or someone) explain this for the non-programmers in the  
group? I have an idea of what you mean, but I don't fully get how it  
would provide those solutions.

If there is a single instance of the software running the top-level  
(meta) government, then isn't that entire instance a single entity  
that is vulnerable to malicious behavior? The instance could be  
distributed (even geographically) over a number of computers, but  
there is still one program that is running, isn't there? Would the  
distributed computers checksum each others' code or something?

</I>
Here I will step aside and let the real programmers talk this one out.  
I suggested Vanilla as an arbitrary starting point, but I expected  
that the more experienced folks would have better ideas.

But since you mention interface... that seems to me to be the most  
important and most difficult part. The closest I have seen to  
something like what I envisioned for Metascore was Slash, the code  
that runs SlashDot. However, I do not find it to be at all accessible  
(especially to non-nerds), and I find it's presentation to be too  
linear and restricted.
