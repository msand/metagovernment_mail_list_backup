<PRE>Jacki said:-
&gt;<i>Each governing body has a scope defined by the governing body that
</I>&gt;<i>granted it the authority to govern, so ultimately there is one
</I>&gt;<i>'government' -- composed of many governing bodies. Example, the US
</I>&gt;<i>constitution grants US states the rights to govern particular aspects
</I>&gt;<i>of society within their borders. Likewise, the US states granted the
</I>&gt;<i>federal government the authority to govern according to the US
</I>&gt;<i>constitution.
</I>
We need to think carefully here about where a systemic entity becomes &quot;whole&quot;. My country Scotland recently voted to take powers back from the UK government after a long and diffcult relationship with rule from London that was absolutely against the cocensus view of the residents of Scotland. The country is now debating the less clear future forward path of, maintaining the current arrangement, taking more powers home to Edinburgh, or becoming independent and inter-dependent with the other countries of the UK.

There are some small islands of the north shores of Scotland that are having the same debate about independence from Scotland. Albeit less viable as independent nations, they are oil rich islands and Scotland would be affected financially.

My question is - increased self-determination feels virtuous and like it can only be a good thing but at which levels does that hold true. If the island of Manhattan declared itself an indepedent nation who's to say they're not right to do so. What if Jersey was so impoverished by limited access to opportunities in independent Manhatten that tensions threatened to reach riot level and beyond. Does it still hold true that the residents of Manhattan have an inalieble right to completely independent self determination.

I know this is a daft scenario but I mean to use these extremes to tease out some of the tough trade-offs when creating the right entities, and when determining who has the rights to confer and delegate responsibilities.

My own view is that some things need done at a certain level in order to be meaningful or viable. There needs to be an environment of cooperation, respect and trust between levels and between entities as well as individuals within any entity.

Most important of all the general principal that all repsonsibilities are held by the individuals themselves, who at all times remain individually and collectively sovereign over their governments at every level. Underneath this general principal is the rule of thumb that delegation happens from neighbourhoods, to communities, to sectors/districts to towns/cities/counties, areas, regions, states, federations, continents, world, rather than delegating down from on high.

Providing this trust, respect and these general principals are in place I personally will tend to sypathise with those that seek greater self-determination even of very small community entities, and even where this places some small additional burdens on others. 

However the danger in this is that it can be taken to extremes where seeking independence is more about selfishness and outsourcing problems to others (as we do in the western hemisphere to the south) rather than other more altruistic goals.

Any thoughts?

Paul
