<PRE>&gt;<i>From Metagovernment.com:
</I>&quot;All open source governments begin with no power and no authority, and are
initially formed as nonprofit institutions or private clubs. Things which
are referred to as laws are not enforceable, and open source governments
begin with no power to use force or collect taxes.&quot;

What if we kicked things off by creating an Open Party?

I realize that some of us have issues with the ruling parties. Those of us
in the United States are all-too familiar with the Two-Party System of
Government. However, I feel those issues would be irrelevant within the
following guidelines:

1. Candidates who run on the Open Party platform must first be registered
within their local Metagovernment. Should no Metagovernment exist for the
community in which they are running, the candidate must make the creation of
a local Metagovernment their top priority in campaigns and in practice.

2. Candidates who are registered within a Metagovernment must gain the
support of their community before an endorsement is given by the Open Party.

3. Candidates must report all Governmental activities to the Metagovernment
-- including votes on the floor, official meetings and activities, every
conceivable dollar amount spent, etc. In respect to voting, no decision will
be made until agreed upon by the community. Failure to do any of these will
result in a negative score.

4. Should the Candidate's score fall to a certain level, they must leave
office at the end of their term.

5. And finally: While candidates are expected to support the Open Party
platform, that platform does not compete with those of typical parties (gay
marriage, abortion, etc.)

Each of these rules would result in the widespread use of Metagovernment
throughout communities and their local governments. It would also ensure
that elected officials are held accountable by their local communities. That
would certainly solve a whole mess of problems here in the United States!
