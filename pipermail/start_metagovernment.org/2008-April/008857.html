<PRE>It might be useful if we could outline the main benefits and disadvantages of having development branches as well as the main trunk. Wikipedia doesn't have branches and seems to manage quite well without them. But probably 90 percent of OSS projects do tend to use development branches.

As I see it there might only be 1 law in effect at the time but the development of the law may go off in different directions only to merge back in later, or perhaps a development may be abandoned or closed, or synthesised with another development also not yet part of the agreed statute books. So its theoretically more adaptable as a result of more possible variations being explored, and it provides a useful framework for major developments to be collaboratively trialed and managed without contaminating the latest &quot;stable release&quot;.

Now that I say that, I can't think how wikipedia get away without branches as they have inter-related articles and topic micro-sites that require considerable collaborative development?

I think the answer is that they keep their branches very small. ie. the discussion pages with reference to the edit history is where branches are explored and debated. If branches can be kept small then more effort goes into trunk development and the project can advance at a faster pace.

It makes a lot of sense for us to have some facility for branches, but for there to be constant pressure (perhaps as in wikipedia's case exerted by the system itself as there is little facility for large branches) to keep them as small as possible. In manufacturing terms this keeps us a low inventory, lean outfit with a high return on our investments and the ability to quickly shift output capacity from one area to another.

&gt;<i> But there does have to be only one &quot;distribution version&quot; of the law
</I>&gt;<i> at any one time.
</I>
Right, the distributed versions are intended for changes, that
eventually should be merged back into the &quot;main&quot; repository.

The important thing here, is to give an overview of the
development on these branches and the discussion surrounding
those, and not just present one version, as wikipedia does.
