<PRE>While I agree with the idea of giving people tools, so the can focus
on their areas of
interest, I would again urge you to stop thinking in terms of voting.
If we think of the
lifecycle of legislation, each member of the community, could choose
to be notified
at different stage, depending on their interest in that area.

Stages would be something like initial proposal, discussion,
revisions/amendments
and eventually it will be queued for merging into the main repository,
signifying
consensus. At any of these points you can choose to be notified and
receive a certain
number of messages. During the discussion phase, you may choose to receive only
the most important messages, or the positions of participating groups. Some may
wish to be informed of all legislation up for merge, and only participate in the
discussion if a bill ever gets that far.

I would hope that holding a vote would be something so special, that
everybody would
want to be notified. It isn't just an indicator of a controversy, but
widespread voting
shows that people are unable to build consensus. Voting is a sign of a
problem within
the community itself.

I've already let go of not having tools for voting in the software,
since there will
inevitably be cases where it is necessary, but lets please not think
of that feature
being the default.

Manuel
