This is also a very attractive prospect of what jackie referred to here as a
shadow government. If enough people use it, representatives in the &quot;real&quot;
parliament would be wise not to stray to far from the opinions expressed
there. If they do, it would obviously going against the will of the people.
Once the people have a clear forum to express their opinion, politicians
will hopefully become little more than moderators and eventually
disappear or merge into the community.

If you ask an expert in any field, they will tell you that politicians
have absolutely no clue what is going on in their field. If an expert
voices her opinion in the forum of the shadow government, directly
addressing an issue, a politician won't be able to ignore it to further
their carrier or the interests of their financiers.

This offers a great path for a peaceful revolution.
