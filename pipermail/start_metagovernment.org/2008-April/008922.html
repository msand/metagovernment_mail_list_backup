<PRE>I have been trying to work out a lingering problem with our new open  
community model. If anyone can start a community, then what gives any  
particular community the force of law? That is, how can a government  
have the ability to enforce laws if participation in the government is  
voluntary?

I think the answer to this may lie in the groundwork we have already  
established: the synthesis score, as defined here:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/#How_it_works">http://www.metagovernment.org/#How_it_works</A>

Synthesis scores could provide the solution if they can transcend any  
particular community. That is, if someone sees two conflicting  
resolutions in two different communities, they can propose a  
resolution in either community (or in a third community) which they  
think synthesizes the other two. If that resolution gains a  
significant synthesis score, then it draws those other two communities  
into its realm, effectively subsuming those communities (at least in  
regard to that one issue).

As an example: imagine that there is a community of people who live  
around a lake. Now imagine a second community of people who do not  
live near that lake, but who like to go fishing there. Each one of  
these has their own community website with its own set of laws. But it  
is easy to imagine that some laws in one community might conflict with  
laws in the other. So in response to one of those conflicts, someone  
could start a new community of people who have a concern with that  
lake (regardless of whether they live on the lake or not). That larger  
community would be better able to come to agreement on issues on which  
the two communities are in conflict.

Does this sound viable as an authority-building mechanism? Can it be  
constructed in such a way that people would be inclined to follow laws  
of the community even if they disagree? In the example, a resident of  
the lake area might not agree with a law made by the larger lake- 
concern community, however they would have to either abide by it or  
stop participating in any of the involved lake communities  
(effectively, they would have to move away).

If this does seem workable, can the programmers in this group imagine  
how it could be implemented? Each instance of Metascore would have to  
be able to influence each other instance.
