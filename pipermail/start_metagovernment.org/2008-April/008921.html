<PRE>&gt;<i> In organizing this project, originally I had thought that we could
</I>&gt;<i> entirely eliminate the need for leaders. But as this discussion has
</I>&gt;<i> developed, I have come to realize that leaders are not inherently
</I>&gt;<i> bad... It is &quot;rulers&quot; with whom I have a problem.
</I>
I too am currently too busy to keep up to date but couldn't resist
replying to this one as I've written an entire chapter on Leadership, but
I see we're on the same wavelength on this issue so I'll restrain myself
to referring to one of the footnotes to that chapter:
<A HREF="http://www.fullmoon.nu/footnotes/leadership.htm">http://www.fullmoon.nu/footnotes/leadership.htm</A>

In short:

&quot;The &quot;Leadership&quot; we don't need is the &quot;Leadership&quot; that believes it
deserves Power over lesser mortals as a reward or even condition for its
contribution&quot;

The informal and unconditional leadership which accompanies inspiration
and/or competence is entirely healthy and, in many situations, absolutely
essential. Just don't make the mistake of allowing Power to accrue to
those who emerge as natural leaders. And strangle at birth anyone who
shows signs of pursuing leadership for its own sake...
