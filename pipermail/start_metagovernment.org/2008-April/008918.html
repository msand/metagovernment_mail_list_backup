<PRE>Apparently the way bees choose a new site for a hive when the old one is too small or damaged is that the whole hive including the queen fly to a tree in the area they want to locate to where they wait and a certain percentage of bees fly off as scouts. Scouts will return to the hive and inform the others about the location of any potential hive sites they find and trough the strength of their &quot;dance&quot; communicate how strongly they feel they would be suitable. The others listen to the scouts and go and check out the locations found, then return to tell the hive how strongly they also feel it would be suitable. Eventually through this process the sites that scouts do not feel strongly about attract less other bees, and the best site or sites attract more. When 1 site attracts a critical number (in the studies I read it was 11 bees, but it is probably a mathematical relation to the size of hive and number of scouts), the scouts at the site realise they are quorate and make the decision then and there. Then they all fy back to the hive and tell the others where the new hive site will be located. Then the whole hive relocates. Studies have shown that the bees always choose the best site when given a variety of options.
I'm sure there are plenty of lessons we can learn from the birds and the bees  ;-)

I've posted this previously, but to reiterate: TheSixtyOne has a great &quot;scoring power system&quot; that rewards people for activities with points. As they accumulate points, they earn higher levels, which gives them greater abilities throughout the community (such as 'bumping' more music, reviving songs, etc.)

To check out theSixtyOne, go to:
<A HREF="http://www.thesixtyone.com/?referred_by_username=geddon">http://www.thesixtyone.com/?referred_by_username=geddon</A>
and click on the green free account button to the right to sign up.

(My apologies for the spam -- you get points for referrals, too!)

If we can develop a sort of Consensus Score formula
which takes into account the total scoring power of everyone in the
community, then as soon as a resolution achieves a certain level of
support (a certain percentage of the overall scoring power of the
community), it becomes law.
