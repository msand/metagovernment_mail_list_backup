That does make a lot of sense. As with many components of this  
project, the answer seems to lie in simplification. By our earlier  
simplification of removing the arbitrarily defined levels of  
government, we also allow for the simplification of user scoring.

The Debian project has long been praised for its innovations in self  
governance, and a recent study reflects what you are saying above. The  
Debian project started as a programmers' meritocracy, where people  
with the best coding skills were the most respected. But over time,  
the community started respecting people for their organizational  
skills as well. Someone who was not a good programmer could  
nonetheless become important to the project by contributing to the  
organization of the project (to its governance).

Here's the link:

(I read the source article, but still have not read the full study.)

I had previously looked at Debian's constitution, and while I like the  
advances they have made, I think we can take it a lot further. They  
still have clearly-defined leaders, which I think we can avoid by  
using open content systems. And, of course, they aren't built to be  
simultaneously scaled to handle every community at once.
