I think you've put your finger on a core element of any truly  
democratic political philosophy: that rights and responsibilities are  
always intertwined. And here people differ as to whether individuals  
can be trusted with responsibility.

In my college Intro to Sociology class, I was taught that (in terms of  
social political philosophy) liberals believe people are naturally  
good and will act responsibly if left to their own devices, while  
conservatives believe people are naturally bad and need outside order  
imposed on them to be able to operate in a functional society.

I would like to operate under a synthesis principle which hopefully  
would have some appeal to both sides of that issue. That is that  
people are neither good nor bad, and the institutions of their society  
determine how they think and act in terms of responsibility. A highly  
authoritarian society cannot immediately switch to full democracy, as  
the people simply are not familiar with the responsibility of being  
free. Likewise, a highly free society does not take kindly to  
imposition of authority.

My point is: I believe that if we can create a more free system, and  
gradually bring people into it, people will start to act with the  
level of responsibility that is demanded from them. The more freedom  
we allow, the more responsibly people will eventually take, provided  
we can provide them a smooth transition that helps them get over the  
established authoritarian mindsets. It may take several generations of  
gradual transition for the most authoritarian societies to be ready to  
be self-deterministic.
