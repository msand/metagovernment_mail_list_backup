<PRE>&gt;<i>  I say this in order to communicate that I am personally committed to
</I>&gt;<i>  the development of the metagovernment, and, to introduce the idea that
</I>&gt;<i>  voter apathy might be a concern. Wikipedia has only a small number of
</I>&gt;<i>  users who contribute content though very many enjoy its benefits. In
</I>&gt;<i>  designing the software, we should ensure that participation is as easy
</I>&gt;<i>  and straightforward as possible.

This is always the case and very hard to overcome, even with the most
simple interface you could imagine. I'd like to share an observation
to underline this fact. Comparing
the viewcount under youtube videos, to its number of ratings, the rate
seems to average around 100-200 views / rating. Thats one click, thats
1 person out of 100-200 willing to express their opinion with the
minimum possible interaction. Granted, they don't directly gain
anything from that click, and you have to be logged in to make a
rating, so the isn't entirely accurate and gives some amount of hope.
The most important thing this shows however, is that participation
shouldn't even depend on having a registered account.
