I wouldn't touch a fingerprint reader with a ten foot pole. The privacy
implications are absolutely staggering and the whole idea is in my
opinion impossible to implement in a secure way, apart from being
undesirable in the first place.

Luckily, I don't see security as too much of a concern, at least with the
rough idea of the software that I have in my head.

In the forums every member can post under whatever name they like,
be it their real name or a pseudonym. If their account is ever
compromised, it will be pretty hard for an importer to write under their
name, without it being pretty obvious what is happening.

This is a great benefit of keeping everything open. All we really need
from a person is an e-mail address and a password-hash. The main
security feature is the community looking out for each other. If we
wan't to get fancy, we could start using public key cryptography,
but that would pose an additional hurdle and should be optional.
