<PRE>I like this philosophy a lot .. I think we should discuss how it might
be implemented as a political system, taking the website you offered
as a potential starting point.

Particularly, here:
       &quot;The version control system gives the project a way to undo the
effects of bad or hasty judgement.&quot;

We should discuss how such a system might 'undo' the results of bad or
damaging legislation, since having continuous modification of many
bills (taxes, fiscal budgets, unlawful actions, etc) could create
havoc. I don't necessarily agree that 'silence is consent'. I would be
more inclined to say that a 'silent page-view' should be considered
consent. In such a model, bills wouldn't pass into law until a
proportion of the interested citizens (those who have expressed in
their preferences an interest in the bill's topic) have viewed the
text and not disagreed? Alternatively, for minor legislation, there
could be a mandatory waiting period during which the interested
individuals are notified?

Which brings me to this section:

        &quot;This also means that the process of establishing consensus
need not be very formal. Most projects handle it by feel. Minor
changes can go in with no discussion, or with minimal discussion
followed by a few nods of agreement. For more significant changes,
especially ones with the potential to destabilize a lot of code,
people should wait a day or two before assuming there is consensus,
the rationale being that no one should be marginalized in an important
conversation simply because he didn't check email frequently enough.&quot;

It would seem that, for a civil government, at least until trust is
established, there would need to be a formal agreement on what would
constitute a minor change, and what a significant change. We wouldn't
want a system where someone could, say, propose military action
against a sovereign nation without obtaining an unequivocal,
nearly-universal consensus. Civil government is unlike software
programming in that not every action can be undone. Similar concerns
would apply to a business organization (offering stock, selling
assets, etc). Given this, I'm not sure that one should adopt this
model as-is. Maybe I'm too much of a republican, but it seems that
there would need to be some constraints -- reached via consensus
(however consensus is defined).

Taking an analogy from machine learning theory, given that the set of
constraints will evolve (read: learn) as the citizens amend their
constitution, we should decide to what extent this learning process
should be directed, ie structured. It can be shown that directed
learning in a machine-learning context will always, ultimately find
the best solution to a problem (provided that the direction is
appropriate), where such success with completely undirected learning
is never certain for most problems. People are not machines, but
software usually needs some structure in order to function. So, it
would seem, the challenge is to provide the right kind of structure,
and the right amount.

Regarding the problem of anonymity, I would echo the statement that
someone on this list made earlier that 'anonymity does not imply a
lack of accountability' -- I would argue that technology makes it
possible to be both anonymous and accountable, provided that the code
is open source and thus subject to criticism/review.

</I>&gt;<i>  have to build consensus with the whole community. This is an important
</I>&gt;<i>  distinction and one of the main reasons open source works. The Idea is
</I>&gt;<i>  not to find out what the majority wants, but what everybody can agree
</I>&gt;<i>  upon. Only in very rare cases should there need to be any formal
</I>&gt;<i>  voting procedures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I could go on, but Karl already said it much better than I ever could.

</I>&gt;<i>  One important difference to voting in the traditional sense, is that it
</I>&gt;<i>  isn't anonymous. This works in open source projects, because the group
</I>&gt;<i>  is small enough, that everybody knows what the other thinks about a
</I>&gt;<i>  proposal, since they have already expressed their opinions during
</I>&gt;<i>  discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I'll start a document entitled &quot;voting&quot; explaining some of the problems
</I>&gt;<i>  it poses and how we may tackle them. In short, the hard part will be
</I>&gt;<i>  doing voting in a massive non-anonymous fashion, which has implications
</I>&gt;<i>  for discrimination and scalability, and doing in an anonymous fashion
</I>&gt;<i>  but making sure everybody can trust the result.
</I>&gt;<i>  Personally, I don't believe either of these can be solved completely
</I>&gt;<i>  satisfactorily, but that may not be a bad thing, since it will be an
</I>&gt;<i>  additional incentive to build consensus.
