<PRE>&gt;<i>  However I want to make an immediate plea to switch to a somewhat more fit
</I>&gt;<i>  for purpose discussion medium. Mailing lists suck. They are impossible to
</I>&gt;<i>  keep track of or sensibly search.
</I>
I would argue, that that is a shortcoming of your email client, not of
mailing lists in general. It actually demonstrates an advantage of
mailing lists, since everybody can organize their mail however they
please and access it with whatever tools they prefer. A forum
restricts its users to one common interface.

&gt;<i>  &quot;I think our priority right now could be to establish common cause and
</I>&gt;<i>  common ground.&quot;
</I>
Precisely correct, and since it doesn't really make that much of a
difference to me, I won't stand in the way of moving.
