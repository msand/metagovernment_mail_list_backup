<PRE>&gt;<i> Here in the United States the Republicans hate abortions and the Democrats

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As mentioned previously, a person still has the option of identifying
</I>&gt;<i> themselves as a Republican, and changing their stance to Pro-Choice, or
</I>&gt;<i> simply change their vote when the time comes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, we're not taking their vote away from them, but simply making it

</I>
Who loves abortions? Who hates choice? Why are we so keen to give away the
power we now finally have the chance to exercise? Shouldn't Americans get
off their asses?

So many questions, I hardly know where to start.

Again, I can certainly imagine groups being something practical, simply to
better understand what a whole group of people are thinking rather than
just keeping tabs on individuals.

&gt;<i>From what I understand, you are implicitly proposing a voting system? I was
</I>under the impression, this would be a last resort, that might justify everybody
actually casting their own vote rather than delegating it. I think we're all so
caught up in current day politics, we can hardly imagine a scenario where
consensus is the default and automatically go back to voting.

Practically speaking, what kind of legislation in you're example would be
controversial? I can hardly imagine Republicans wanting to put women
who have had an abortion in jail. If you're not going to punish something
you want to make a crime, then what purpose does it serve to make it
illegal? As far as I can tell, this isn't a question of legislation, but a
reflection of a social divide in America, which politicians capitalize on in
their campaigns.

The topic wouldn't be nearly as controversial if, as Ed suggested in an
earlier post, the debate were centered around actual practical solutions,
rather than &quot;to which group do I belong?&quot;.
