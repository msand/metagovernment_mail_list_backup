<PRE>&gt;<i>  Since anyone in the world can contribute to any government, then a
</I>&gt;<i>  constitution would also provide a score multiplier to anyone it
</I>&gt;<i>  defines as being directly a member of its community. In other words,
</I>
While it may seem intuitive, I'm not sure that it's such a good idea to let
people hand out multipliers in that fashion. If each message gets a rating,
we could calculate a multiplier for that person, based on their past
ratings. Those multipliers would hopefully then better reflect how much
the community values the opinion of that person for a certain topic.

This also makes the system much more general (no explicit role modeling),
scalable (try to evaluate 1000 people and assign each an appropriate
multiplier),
easy to administer (no need to evaluate if a person is actually a member of the
community), program (no need for code expressing all of the above) and possibly
fairer (any assigned rating will discriminate or overrepresent a person to some
degree), than manually giving members a multiplier.

In you're example, if a doctor is competent, he will probably get an
appropriate multiplier, without any explicit help, simply from the ratings
his messages get. Maybe a head nurse, who is not so much
concentrated on one particular area of the hospital, would get a better
overall multiplier however, if members of the community, feel (as
expressed by their ratings) that her messages are worth reading.

This also has the benefit, of not having to carry the hierarchy people
may perceive in their organization, into the system (may not be
something every manager will want to hear) but generating a
hierarchy of its own, based on merit.
