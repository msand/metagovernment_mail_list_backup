<PRE>greetings Jacki
&gt;<i> Question: If we're not 'voting' -- ie, if there is no tally of whether
</I>&gt;<i> a person agrees or dissents, how do we know when consensus is reached?
</I>
you invite Dissent. If none is forthcoming, we have reached consensus. The
Spanish Anarchist trade unions still (I believe) use this model.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does one have to propose an alternative in order to dissent?
</I>
No. But you are under at least a moral obligation to explain your dissent.
Primarily this implies a need to demonstrate how or why the proposal would
either fail to achieve its objective (which you might well share) or how
it would cause harm to one or more members of the community.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, if only 1 person of 2 million proposes an alternative, and all
</I>&gt;<i> others agree with the first proposal, is consensus reached?
</I>
No, but the 1,999,999 in agreement clearly have the muscle to impose their
will. They should still, however, formally take that step (rather than
simply take it for granted that the policy is now as they've agreed it)
and they can not ethically object if the dissenter stubbornly resists to
the best of their ability...

Like you I have considered the problem that, in practice, we'll hardly
ever achieve consensus even on trivial issues like the weather. I have
proposed elsewhere, for example, that a country should never go to war
unless it can demonstrate that at least 95% of its citizens agree that it
is necessary to do so. But even if we agree that this would be a
reasonable basis for the decision it wouldn't disguise the absence of
consensus.

Granted the 5% may feel sufficiently intimidated not to interfere with the
wishes of the warmongers but it still isn't consensus and we should never
fudge the issue by pretending that very large majorities (which are the
practical solution to the absence of consensus) are still ONLY majorities.
The very least we still owe to the the minority is to record their
dissent.
