Arguably even 80's, but who's counting ;-) To be perfectly honest
though, I don't see anything wrong with a mailing list for now.
They're easy to use, don't require login or registration to post to,
you just send an email to the list. Administration overhead is fairly
low.
If you want to write a private message, you can just write to the
person directly and don't have to switch to a different medium.
There are a few reasons mailing lists have lasted this long and while
forums have their place, I'm not sure the discussions of an open
source project are one of them.

Concerning your argument of forums being more organized: The
discussion forum, be it a web forum or an e-mail list, isn't a place I
would consider needing very much organization. It's the place of
discussion about what is being developed, and the most relevant
threads, are the current ones. Everything we build consensus upon
should of course be organized, the place for those documents however
is the repository and not the forum.

How this ties together with the software we intend to produce and use,
is something we should discuss after we have come to a consensus about
what the software will look like.
