<PRE>&gt;<i> Christopher said &quot;(I'm hoping there is a &quot;Socialist&quot; button that I can click
</I>&gt;<i> on to auto-pilot my decisions.)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a great concept. Although some of us, myself included, may think
</I>&gt;<i> that political parties are part of the problem rather than part of the
</I>&gt;<i> solution, if we come up with a solution which gives them power and
</I>&gt;<i> influence, but (for once) in a genuinely democratic and over-ridable way
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> So if we can help groups of people connected by common ideologies(political
</I>&gt;<i> parties, pressure groups or whatever) to offer the public templates to make
</I>&gt;<i> their choices easier - WOW - that is a powerful solution (not comproimise!).
</I>
I'm not a big fan of this, and frankly quite scared, that this is
finding so much
approval. Although I'm not so naive to think we could get the clean break from
the old political parties that I would like, I wouldn't suggest implementing
features to encourage the building of parties.

I've already stated, that my main goal for this project is the
political education
of people, by giving them more responsibility for their government and thereby
getting them to think. An &quot;autopilot button&quot; is something I'd rather not see.
What say should you have (directly or by delegating to a party), in something
that you either don't care about, or don't understand enough to make a
decision for yourself? If we encourage parties in this system, they will
inevitably have some populist tendencies.

While I think we shouldn't go to far into examples, so we can stay focused on
the project, rather than sparking some unrelated controversy, I will offer this
as an example of why it might not be such a good idea to have a &quot;socialist
button&quot;.
The idea of a minimum wage is something I would associate with socialism but
some economists would argue, is actually anti-social. This may or may not be
true, but how are we ever going to get people to think about it and do their
own research, if we offer a feature to superficially judge the subject and
choose a group to make the decision for them. I'm especially concerned about
groups with good intents, that appeal to the masses but without good solutions.
Superficially a party supporting minimum wage may feel like the right
choice, but
are they really offering the right solution? It's hard to argue against giving
somebody barely enough to survive, especially, if you have to ask somebody to
spend an hour or two of their lives to even understand the argument you are
trying to make. I'm not interested in making people feel good, if it has a cost
which is masked by propaganda.

As we say in Germany:
Gut gemeint ist nicht immer gut gemacht.
(Well intended isn't always well executed.)

Apart from that, the idea of building consensus and balkanizing a community
seem kind of exclusionary and something we would want to stop if at all
possible. The mentality in the community should be to find the best solution,
considering all proposals at hand, rather than fighting for one proposal by the
&quot;own&quot; party, regardless of its merit.

Manuel
