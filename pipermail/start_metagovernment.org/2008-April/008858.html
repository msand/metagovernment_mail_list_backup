<PRE>I think branches are important, since legislation is often lengthy and
people may agree with most of what's there but disagree with one part.
If we have branches, there ought to be a way to merge the result of
branch development (once consensus on a branching element is reached)
back into the 'trunk' document.

One way wikipedia solves this problem is by keeping their article
topics relatively short and focused, and allowing one to 'include' a
subpage into a main page. We can implement something similar, but the
size of our articles cannot be limited only for the sake of
convenience. Thus, we may need to allow branching.

</I>&gt;<i> I think the answer is that they keep their branches very small. ie. the

</I>&gt;<i> It makes a lot of sense for us to have some facility for branches, but for

</I>&gt;<i> system itself as there is little facility for large branches) to keep them
</I>&gt;<i> as small as possible. In manufacturing terms this keeps us a low inventory,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But there does have to be only one &quot;distribution version&quot; of the law

</I>&gt;<i> Right, the distributed versions are intended for changes, that
