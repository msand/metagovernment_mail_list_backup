<PRE>I believe the concept of voting is taking an interesting turn in the new
millennium. Instead of going to the polls to check an issue or candidate
box, voting in today's world seems to be geared more towards &quot;Am I Hot or
Not?&quot;

For example: When I listen to music on Pandora, clicking either thumbs up or
down helps create a music stream which is customized to my personal tastes.
I didn't pull out my picket sign and chant &quot;No More Emo!&quot; but instead,
offered my opinions on whether or not I liked something in particular. Of
course, if the music stream becomes &quot;corrupted,&quot; I can always go back and
change my decisions.

When I imagine our own &quot;decision making tools,&quot; I see a SourceForge.net --
LegalForge.net? -- which enables &quot;Open Source Law Coders&quot; to manage,
communicate, and code their own laws. To be sure: coding isn't easy. It
requires a bit of understanding. But once the developers release the code,
the rest of us can see it in action (wherever the code was released) and
&quot;thumb it up&quot; accordingly.

Once it reaches the rest of us, I see an entire community providing their
opinions on on their laws and regulations -- making recommendations to their
friends, checking out similar laws from other communities. All that might be
a bit much for your average person to handle. (I'm hoping there is a
&quot;Socialist&quot; button that I can click on to auto-pilot my decisions.) But as
always, anyone can interact as much [or as little] as they desire.
