<PRE>I do see your point.

I was looking for ways for people to become more involved with the political
processes without requiring them to sign into their account on an hourly
basis. From my perspective, many will rely on mobile phones, public
computers, or possibly ATM machines to register their votes. Those who own
their own computers and internet connections would possibly have an
advantage when it comes to the process.

If we can find a way to ensure that those without 24hr internet access
aren't disenfranchised, I think my concerns would be answered. However, as a
frequent user of Digg.com and theSixtyOne.com, I know that my daily activity
provides me with better connections and higher points than those who only
check in once a month. Maybe this is a strength of the system: where those
more dedicated are naturally rewarded for their commitment.

I'm on the fence with this one.
