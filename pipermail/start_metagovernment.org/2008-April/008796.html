<PRE>Addressing the first task in the list posted by ed.

Disclaimer: I realize I'm going fairly fast here, mainly because
I want to us started off on the right foot in terms of project
organization. It may appear, as if I'm somehow trying to take
control, by hosting a repository for our files and by using tools
we haven't formally agreed upon. I'll continue, even at the risk
of being obnoxious, for which I apologize.

The reason for choosing a distributed version control system like
mercurial, is so that at least from a technical standpoint, there
is no authoritative repository, which would be the case if we were
to use the facilities that Sourceforge offers. From a social
standpoint, a few repositories may become authoritative, but that
will be because due to the trust the maintainers of those
repositories have established in the community. Even then, the
chance of corruption on the part of the maintainer has little to
no negative effect, apart from the loss of a good maintainer of
course. Since everybody has their own repository, everybody is an
equal peer and can take over the job.

This directly addresses the problem of corruption for the most
important asset of the project, its documents and code. This
includes the files of the website and thus the outer appearance
of the project.

I've already posted some resources on how to use mercurial, and
the documentation is better than anything I could write here.

I've produced two patches, which you can apply to your repository
with the commands.

 &gt; hg import tasklist.diff
 &gt; hg import project-guidelines.diff

I'll be online in #metascore and will be happy to help you get
set up.

The patches include descriptions of my ideas for the development
model and are an implicit proposal. I'll apply the patches to
the repository at mbarkhau.dyndns.org if nobody objects within
3 days. This will also be the case for any other patches posted to
this mailing list.

You can produce patches yourself, by committing to your local
repository and exporting your changes to a patch file.

 &gt; hg export -o filename tip

This exports the changes of the latest commit into the file
&quot;filename&quot;.

Most programmers are more accustomed to pushing their changes to
a repository. And I'm aware of the cost of learning a new tool, so
I'll try to justify this cost.

- With a centralized repository, somebody has to determine, who is
allowed to commit to the server of the project.
- You actually need a central server and a trusted administrator.
- Anybody with commit access can commit their changes to the
repository, without being certain that everybody agrees with
those changes.
- Submitting patches for review gives writers feedback and a chance
to revise and resubmit their patches.
