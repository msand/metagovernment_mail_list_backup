<PRE>I would argue that the need for *some* resolution to a difference of
opinion to be found is the motivating force behind synthesis and
compromise. Should we have a 50/50 split of opinion between two
competing versions of a bill or proposal, it would seem that a pure
vote (which may result in a close 51/49 result) would not solve the
problem ... the mere fact that both sides agree that *something* needs
to be passed should motivate the synthesis of both sides into the
final product, and both sides to compromise some part of their
position in order to achieve this if necessary. It is not enough to
have a mere vote in the absence of organic consensus.
