<PRE>&gt;<i> But blogs do not exist in that paradigm. Blogs are usually edited by a small
</I>&gt;<i> group of writers who are directly affected by their readers -- a force which
</I>&gt;<i> affects the world around as it gains more popularity and influence. Back in
</I>&gt;<i> the real world we hear NPR placing popular blog editors on the radio next to
</I>&gt;<i> the PhD's who have studied the subject for decades.
</I>
I wouldn't treat the rating system as a static formula that applies to every
person equally. Members of certain parts of a community may want to
read the messages which they think are worth reading. To a certain extent,
this already happens automatically with blogs. The more links there are to
a blog, the more people will read it. This can certainly considered to be a
rating mechanism similar to what we might want to implement.

We could divide the messages a user gets to see first between messages that
are widely accepted in the community, and those of respected people in their
particular niche.

Messages and conversations connected to a particular legislation would be
ordered by their importance/rating or in the case of a conversation by the
combined ratings of its messages.
