<PRE>I see the story going something like this:

On the election ballot this year are three candidates: one running for the
Democrats, another for Republicans, and a third for the Open Party. As to be
expected, the Democrats are promising better social services, while the
Republicans are concerned about the Economy. But the third candidate -- the
Open Party candidate -- talks about a system which represents everyone, as a
whole community, and promises to keep the party informed of his activities,
and votes according to their wishes.

Should the Democrat win, they typically enjoy the support of their
constituents, while suffering the attacks of the Republicans. Should a
Republican win, they typically enjoy the exact same thing (in reverse).
However, should an Open Party candidate win the election, both the Democrats
and Republicans have only the community to criticize, for it is their
decision which drives the candidate (who is merely acting on our behalf).

</I>&gt;<i> 1) people who consider voting for the open party candidate cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> assured of what positions they are voting for -- also, it would
</I>&gt;<i> introduce software complexity as we would have to know which users are
</I>&gt;<i> and are not among the candidate's constituents (for purposes of
</I>&gt;<i> fairness), and possibly tally support by this categorization  .. though
</I>&gt;<i> this would likely be a necessary feature anyways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) position statements would have to be different from voting behavior
</I>&gt;<i> -- right now, at least in the US, politics is based on back-room deals
</I>&gt;<i> and such .. kind of like, i will support you on A if you support me on
</I>&gt;<i> B, or if you agree to vote against C with me, etc. This would make
</I>&gt;<i> administration via metagovernment more complicated. Though, here,
</I>&gt;<i> transparency would be tremendously helpful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a governor or mayor (brad blanton) who ran for the US congress
</I>&gt;<i> (house of reps) for Richmond, VA on a platform of radical honesty -- he
</I>&gt;<i> agreed to wear a microphone at all political meetings/events/dealings
</I>&gt;<i> and record every telephone conversation, the transcripts of which were
</I>&gt;<i> published on his website for all to see. Also, there is the Senator
</I>&gt;<i> On-line party (<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_On-Line">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_On-Line</A>) in
</I>&gt;<i> Australia that campaigns in a similar fashion, where elected officials
</I>&gt;<i> act according to input from constituents on their site. I would argue
</I>&gt;<i> that supporting initiatives like this with our proposed open-source
</I>&gt;<i> package could be only a good thing.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;From Metagovernment.com:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;All open source governments begin with no power and no authority, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are initially formed as nonprofit institutions or private clubs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Things which are referred to as laws are not enforceable, and open
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source governments begin with no power to use force or collect taxes.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What if we kicked things off by creating an Open Party?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I realize that some of us have issues with the ruling parties. Those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of us in the United States are all-too familiar with the Two-Party
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System of Government. However, I feel those issues would be irrelevant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within the following guidelines:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Candidates who run on the Open Party platform must first be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; registered within their local Metagovernment. Should no Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exist for the community in which they are running, the candidate must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make the creation of a local Metagovernment their top priority in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; campaigns and in practice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Candidates who are registered within a Metagovernment must gain the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support of their community before an endorsement is given by the Open
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Party.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Candidates must report all Governmental activities to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagovernment -- including votes on the floor, official meetings and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; activities, every conceivable dollar amount spent, etc. In respect to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voting, no decision will be made until agreed upon by the community.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Failure to do any of these will result in a negative score.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Should the Candidate's score fall to a certain level, they must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leave office at the end of their term.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5. And finally: While candidates are expected to support the Open
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Party platform, that platform does not compete with those of typical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parties (gay marriage, abortion, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each of these rules would result in the widespread use of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagovernment throughout communities and their local governments. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would also ensure that elected officials are held accountable by their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; local communities. That would certainly solve a whole mess of problems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here in the United States!
