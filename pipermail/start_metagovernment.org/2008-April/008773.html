<PRE>&gt;<i>  I am sure that you are each aware that this project is almost absurdly
</I>&gt;<i>  ambitious: attempting to implement a new form of human governance.
</I>
I don't find the ultimate goal absurdly ambitious, most people in a
democracy will probably agree that it is far from the optimal
government. I think there is great potential for support from very many
people. It would however be absurdly ambitious to try to implement an
open source government on a national level, right from the beginning.

Although I think most of us have the ultimate goal of a national
government, where every citizen can participate, I think we shouldn't
constrain ourselves to this. I can even think of stockholders wanting
to discuss with the employees how best to run a company, rather than
leaving it to overpaid executives.

I think the theme the project should follow, is that this government model
is suitable for quite a range of communities and organizations.
This gives a clear path for spreading the model of open source
governance.

We ourselves should of course be the very first, to adopt it, on the
principle of eating you're own dog food as a developer. Local
communities will hopefully adopt it as a more efficient way of
discussion than a meeting in the town hall or the like. Working our
way up through state level government maybe even some large
organizations, eventually some small rouge state (probably the
swiss ;-) will adopt it and the modle will have a chance to prove itself.
