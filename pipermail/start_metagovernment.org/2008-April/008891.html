<PRE>I don't think anyone should be handing over an opinion to a group -- 
rather, the group should be able to behave like an individual in the 
discussion provided that the group has approved the common opinion and 
has agreed to delegate... that said, if I have noted my support and 
participation in a group, and the group votes for a particular measure, 
i should still be able to vote as an opinion on the same measure.

the nice thing about supporting groups is that it incorporates the most 
politically active members of any society (lobbyists, unions, other 
organizations) and gives them a stake in supporting the system. They, 
who are most often seeking a stronger voice in the current system, may 
be our strongest supporters. And, even if the metagovernment model isn't 
adopted by the government, it may be used to govern their organizations.

that said, i would propose that groups should be able to develop 
legislation and position statements within their organization, and 
decide how the group's position on other legislation should be 
determined (whose votes speak for the group), but that the group's 
rating/score should not depend on the group's membership directly. 
Rather, it should be determined exactly like the rating of individuals 
-- according to broader approval and disapproval ratings of the group's 
contributions to the overall system.

Thoughts?
