<PRE>Christopher said &quot;(I'm hoping there is a &quot;Socialist&quot; button that I can click on to auto-pilot my decisions.)&quot;

This is a great concept. Although some of us, myself included, may think that political parties are part of the problem rather than part of the solution, if we come up with a solution which gives them power and influence, but (for once) in a genuinely democratic and over-ridable way (where the individual is the ultimate authority), this may help us win hearts and minds within the political status quo, and therefore make radically faster and better progress. I know a few politicians, former politicians, and political activists from across the UK political spectrum, and by and large they (the ones I know) are not in it for money, fame or corrupt power. For most of them, the task of serving as local councillors or MPs is sometimes a thankless task, getting criticism from all sides in return for considerable effort and personal investment over and above the call of duty.

So if we can help groups of people connected by common ideologies(political parties, pressure groups or whatever) to offer the public templates to make their choices easier - WOW - that is a powerful solution (not comproimise!). 

1. It gives the status quo a way to engage in a meaningul way.
2. It harnesses the considerable volunteer effort and commitment typically made by political activists, and channels this into the metagovernment way of doing things.
3. We may persuade the parties themselves to become metagovernment style organisations in their own right, or to set up parallel organisations which work in this way. (in my view this one thing would have a dramitic and positive effect ).
4. It doesn't throw the baby out with the bathwater (there are some benefits to our current system even if the system as a whole is broken).
5. It makes the job of citizen engagement as easy as it is currently. ie for people that just want to vote once every 5 years - they can subscribe to a template maintained by their favourite political movement. 
6. ...But at any time they can delve deeper into the source-code to debate or over-ride the party settings, and preferences, on a particular issue or suite of issues.
