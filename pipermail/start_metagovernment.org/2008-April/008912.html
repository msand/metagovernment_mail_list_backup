<PRE>I've written an initial and incomplete outline for the architecture.
I hope we can modify and extend this, until we have a fairly
complete design spec.

Architecture Proposal

So much of the recent discussion revolved around what the software
should in principal be doing, Ed suggested we work toward consensus on
this topic.

Here is a basic outline of a possible architecture for metascore,
based on what I've gathered so far from the mailing list. Certainly
there is a bias towards my ideas.

    - General Architecture:
        - Client Server architecture for discussion.
        - Central repository containing current valid legislation.
        - Distributed repositories containing legislation under
          discussion.
        - Client is either a web browser or an e-mail client
        - Server offers various services (see below)

    - Server:
        - All data on which the server operates, can be
          retrieved and replicated on another instance of
          metascore.
            This ensures anybody can set up their own server
            and see that the server is behaving as expected,
            on a machine to which they have access.

    - Subscriptions:
        - available for discussions concerning topics (tags
          see below)
        - to all events in the life cycle (see below) of a
          proposal
        - messages via e-mail, rss and from the web-page
        - amount and kind of messages are configurable based on the
          score they receive and the topics they concern
        - messages to discussions in which the user participates
          will be sent regardless of subscription

    - Website:
        - pages members/groups
        - current legislation
        - proposed legislation
        - discussion pages
        - user preferences and account management
        - no flash
        - limited javascript(browser mustn't require it)

    - Tagging:
        - All legislation receives a unique tag which may be applied to
          corresponding discussions.
        - different revisions of of the same legislation use revision id
          of the repository with a prefix &quot;rev&quot; as a tag
        - used to group similar and competing legislation

    - Discussions:
        - Participation via e-mail
            - Server will parse e-mails it receives for tags, so it
              knows to which discussion a message belongs
            - Conventions should be set up to help the server with
              parsing
            - Signed messages from users who have uploaded a PGP key for
              their account, will be accepted like any message entered
              through the web interface
            - Unsigned messages will go through a spam filter and may
              be marked as spam by users

        - Participation through the website
            - Messages may be entered like in any forum software
            - Rating of messages, members and groups
                - Ratings only apply to specific topics
                - Ratings for value to the discussion, regardless
                    of own opinion
                - Ratings for level of agreement
                - Ratings result in higher visibility of messages

    - Voting:
        - If no consensus can be reached on a proposal,
          participants may decide to put it up for a vote.
        - The participants can be restricted to registered and
          verified members of the community.
        - Voting will not be anonymous, as this will be to to difficult
          to implement in a secure way.

    - Repositories:
        - All legislation is under revision control
        - Legislation is plain text
            - machine readable formating (title, paragraphs etc. can be parsed)
        - Proposed legislation may be edited via a web interface
