My initial vision was a single distributed behemoth, like Wikipedia.  
Have a look here for their architecture:

As others noted, that makes the system more vulnerable to directed  
attack and makes it less flexible (which results in forks anyway). I  
can certainly see the benefit of distributed implementations. So I  
wold like to propose we work toward a synthesis, of course.

Maybe we need to envision Metascore as something like a software  
standard (such as UNIX) and also as something like a communication  
standard (like Internet Protocol).

As a software standard, it would be a source code which is published  
in one form, but which is expected to be modified in its adaptation to  
any particular community. Hopefully the default configuration will  
work for most communities, but people can adapt it or fork different  
projects as they please. They can even use completely different  
software if they choose.

As a communication standard, it would enable every community to  
interact with every other community, regardless of how they have  
tweaked their software. An individual would have to set up an account  
on any community they wished to participate in, but most of their  
preferences would be carried over from their personal settings. and  
communities could &quot;borrow&quot; scores and laws from each other, allowing  
&quot;levels&quot; of government to form themselves.
