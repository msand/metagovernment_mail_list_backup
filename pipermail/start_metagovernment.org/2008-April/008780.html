<PRE>Hi .. wanted to introduce myself.

I'm the director of data management at an academic clinical research
organization at Harvard Med School in Boston.  I administrate MySQL
databases and oversee the management of clinical trial data, but more
importantly I have developed an electronic data collection and trial
management application using VB, S and Java.  I also develop and
maintain a few clinical-research-related websites which collect and
distribute research findings (videos, slides, a journal, and news),
and to maintain ongoing trials. I primarily work in PHP, Java and
MySQL.

I have to say, I'm very, very excited about the project. Living in the
US, it's clear to me that a purely representative government has its
limitations. I contacted Ed soon after a discussion with some
colleagues in which I proposed a &quot;shadow-government&quot; website, that
would give citizens the tools to stay informed of their government's
actions and to better interact with the existing representative
structure. Essentially, the tool set would be the same as that
proposed by the metagovernment site, but it would be pulling its data
from the various existing legislative bodies in order to improve
legislative transparency and allow all citizens to vote, comment, and
modify/propose new legislation.

One could see this as a possible first-step in the transition towards
a more pure metagovernment vision, where citizen votes on the site
have consequence beyond expressing public opinion.

Hopefully this helps to give an idea of where I'm coming from -- it
seems we have an ambitious team here with lots of great ideas ..  I
look forward to getting started!

Jacki
