<PRE>&gt;<i> I would argue that the need for *some* resolution to a difference of

</I>&gt;<i> competing versions of a bill or proposal, it would seem that a pure
</I>&gt;<i> vote (which may result in a close 51/49 result) would not solve the
</I>&gt;<i> problem ... the mere fact that both sides agree that *something* needs
</I>&gt;<i> to be passed should motivate the synthesis of both sides into the
</I>&gt;<i> final product, and both sides to compromise some part of their
</I>&gt;<i> position in order to achieve this if necessary. It is not enough to
</I>&gt;<i> have a mere vote in the absence of organic consensus.
</I>
The importance of the Pareto principle is that it raises a warning flag.

In your example above, (or in fact ANY example of an intelligent rational
debate) the attempt should obviously be made to find a compromise (or
synthesis). However, providing no dissent of the form &quot;This is going to
cost me brothers&quot; has been raised, AND a consensus exists that a decision
MUST be made, then majority voting is OK. Obviously the more who support a
proposition the better and debate should continue until the support has
been maximised, but, in the absence of cost, even a simple majority
(50%+1) is sustainable because no one has lost anything.

There has to be a caveat to spell out that &quot;relative loss&quot; is - or can be
- a reasonable Pareto objection. For example, if there are 10 of us and 9
bananas arrive by some means. 9 getting a banana each leaves the 10th with
a reasonable complaint of relative loss. But, hopefully, that kind of
blatantly unfair proposal would be fairly rare in the kind of civilised
community which would implement the kind of debating algorithm we're
looking to build.

In any case, the rules change as soon as the warning flag has been raised.
For a start we can't merely assume that someone's assertion of potential
cost/harm is valid. They have to defend that assertion with evidence or,
at least, cogent argument. But if the potential loss is accepted then,
immediately (if people adopted my proposed principles) the proponents are
obliged calculate the costs and amend their proposal to include
compensation (or, of course, withdraw the proposal).

Note that this is scalable even to those situations where there is no cost
free option (like my previously mentioned example of &quot;which side of the
road shall we drive on?&quot;) Where a cost is inevitable, the only obviously
fair option is for the whole community to share that cost and apportion it
fairly (which would no doubt trigger a further democratic debate of its
own)
