<PRE>It may be possible for the life-cycle to be controlled purely by the  
scoring system. If we can develop a sort of Consensus Score formula  
which takes into account the total scoring power of everyone in the  
community, then as soon as a resolution achieves a certain level of  
support (a certain percentage of the overall scoring power of the  
community), it becomes law. That percentage can vary depending on the  
implementation (ie, each community can have a different cutoff point).  
Once something becomes law, its score has to drop significantly before  
it goes out of effect. That last caveat would be to prevent flapping,  
where laws keep going into and out of effect.

This again helps with scaling to different sized communities. In a  
very large community, there will necessarily be a long time period  
before something becomes a law... unless it has tremendous immediate  
support. But in a very small community, things can become &quot;law&quot; very  
quickly. In a small club where everyone has mobile-phone internet  
access, they could make decisions practically instantly if they  
already have consensus.
