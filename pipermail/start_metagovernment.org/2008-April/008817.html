<PRE>Manuel Said:
&quot;the main one being that voting is actually not a good way to do
democracy.&quot;

spot on. He added:

&quot;Resolutions shouldn't be produced, in which the majority can inflict its
will on a minority. You have to build consensus with the whole community.
This is an important distinction and one of the main reasons open source
works. The Idea is not to find out what the majority wants, but what
everybody can agree upon. Only in very rare cases should there need to be
any formal voting procedures.&quot;

This is one of the primary focusses of my own work. See for example

<A HREF="http://www.fullmoon.nu/book/chap.php?id=c07_1#athens">http://www.fullmoon.nu/book/chap.php?id=c07_1#athens</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/3/29/52250/4540">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/3/29/52250/4540</A>

Democracy means People Power, it does not mean &quot;Majority Rule&quot;, it means
AT LEAST &quot;Majority Rule&quot; but that is very much a last resort to be adopted
under two conditions only:

1 There is a consensus that a decision MUST be reached on the substantive
issue but
2 No consensus can be reached on that issue.

The example I give in my &quot;Democratic Cannibals&quot; story (second link above)
is the decision on &quot;which side of the road should we drive&quot;. We cannot
afford NOT to make a decision because that would produce carnage. But we
might have a split within the community based on which side of the road
our existing vehicles are designed to travel on.

In such a case the &quot;fair&quot; solution is also the cheapest. i.e. to favour
the majority but compensate the minority (who, presumably, will have to
buy new cars or pay to have their cars adapted). i.e. the whole community
bears the cost of ensuring that the minority don't suffer as a result of a
decision by the majority.

Essentially there is no ethical case for arguing that a minority should be
forced or obliged to tolerate a decision by a majority which causes harm
or cost to that minority. This imposes a form of ethical hierarchy or
priority on the decision making process.

For example:
The first aim - and ideal result - is to achieve true consensus - the
complete absence of dissent.

If that fails, the next decision has to be whether we still need a
decision at all.

If no agreement can be reached on that, then the next question is
restricted to those who are convinced a decision must be taken. Can they
arrive at one which affects only themselves and excludes those who do not
wish to be party to it.

If no such restricted decision is possible, do they agree between
themselves that they must, nevertheless, seek to impose their decision on
the dissenters (and do they have the means to do so?)

Meanwhile the dissenters will be holding their own discussions about how
much their dissent matters and whether imposition would force them to
leave (or fight) the rest of the &quot;democratic&quot; group.

In other words, voting is always a sign of failure to meet the initial
ideal. And once we have dissent, the real issue - for the majority - is
whether the issue is so important that it justifies overriding the dissent
with measures ranging from compensation through to military force.

The Athenians recognized those basic rules and remain the only significant
historical attempt to implement them. They failed partly because while
they understood the need for consensus either on the issue or at least the
need to reach a decision (voting never took place, under the Athenian
system, if there wasn't a prior consensus that a decision was necessary)
they didn't account for the sheeplike tendency of people to follow those
who spoke forcefully or charismatically rather than those who spoke
wisely.

It is that weakness in the original democratic model which I am most
concerned to tackle. The web, fortunately, holds the solution, in that it
provides a level playing field in which all contributions can be stripped
of extraneous influences. Here, it need not matter what we look like or
sound like, our ideas can stand or fall purely on the basis of their
intrinsic merit. And we can present our arguments using whichever
techniques best suit our abilities.

I for one like to take my time in debate. I will not participate, for
instance, in the IRC channel that Manuel is suggesting - or any other real
time chat. At least not on a serious issue. (Actually that was a strange
suggestion from Manuel giving that he's also commented on the need to
ensure accessibility to those with various disabilities - with which I
agree)

I can - and will - take hours (sometimes days) to formulate my thoughts or
responses and have no intention of being &quot;rushed&quot;!
