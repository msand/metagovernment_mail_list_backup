Here in the United States the Republicans hate abortions and the Democrats
love Choice. If I were to identify myself as a Democrat on the system, my
Pro-Choice vote would automatically be recorded whenever a new law was
introduced (or whenever else appropriate). The same would be true if I
identified myself as a Republican -- only, in reverse!

Whenever someone identifies themselves as an X (Democrat, Socialist,
Republican, etc.) they are essentially -- I shudder to admit -- handing
their opinion over to another person; namely, the leaders of the
organization who decide if abortion or choice is the right way to go.

As mentioned previously, a person still has the option of identifying
themselves as a Republican, and changing their stance to Pro-Choice, or
simply change their vote when the time comes.

Ultimately, we're not taking their vote away from them, but simply making it
easier for all of us Americans to remain attached to our sofas.
