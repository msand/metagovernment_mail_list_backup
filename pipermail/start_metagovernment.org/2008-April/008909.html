<PRE>I would like to summarize what I think we have decided so far in terms  
of structuring the code. (Not talking about interface yet.) Feel free  
to correct or disagree.

Each installation of Metascore runs one community (or more). A  
community is any self-defined group with a common concern (such as,  
but not limited to geography). Communities may wish to have their  
software periodically audited in order to check for tampering.

User accounts are portable. So if a person has an account in one  
community, they can easily join another with minimal setup. I do not  
know if user accounts would have to be managed in a separate  
repository. Each person has a score within each community.

Each community is tracked by a unique community-identifier field. So  
multiple communities can exist in one installation.

Communities can share data with each other. For instance a  
neighborhood can &quot;trust&quot; the user scores maintained by its larger  
township. They can share laws too, so that smaller communities can  
incorporate the laws of their larger parent community.

Does this sound right so far?

To address Manuel's question of language, no, I don't think we are  
stuck on PHP/MySQL. Those were chosen because they are popular and  
open, but we should use whatever works best. As long as it is  
completely open.
