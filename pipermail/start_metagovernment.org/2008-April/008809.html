<PRE>&gt;<i>  Also, I should mention that in addition to the sourceforge project,
</I>&gt;<i>  the metagovernment.org site is on a full-service hosting account, so
</I>&gt;<i>  we are free to set up whatever software/databases we want there. I do
</I>&gt;<i>  like the idea of distributing, but at the very outset we might want to
</I>&gt;<i>  work toward some sort of unity.
</I>
The distributed nature implies that everybody has the whole repository,
that doesn't mean however, that it isn't useful or desirable to have a
central server. At least one authoritative server for people to work
against is very desirable for the project, simply for an efficient
workflow.

The distributed nature of mercurial doesn't mean the code is distributed
and everybody has their own version to work on, in any direction they
choose. Although that is certainly possible with this system, eventually
people will want to merge their changes back to the community, which
is in most cases one specific repository with a trusted maintainer and
eventually all the distributed repositories, since they pull changes
from there.

I would certainly trust you to maintain a repository on the
metagovernment.org server, if you are willing to put in the effort Ed.
The point is, that since we all have the entire repository, I don't have
to trust you to the extent that the entire project would fall into chaos
if you were to go bonkers. The community can simply decide to take its
code somewhere else if that should ever happen.

The hg book contains a chapter on setting up and interacting with a hg
server, if that's something you want to set up.

Again I'll be in #metascore if you need any help.
