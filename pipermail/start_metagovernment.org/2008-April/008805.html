In my view, open source governance is the perfect solution to the  
reality of voter apathy. People can be as apathetic as they want to be  
without harming the rest of us. And after all, no person can be  
involved in every issue: that's why current democracies force us to  
bundle issues together into a platform and/or a candidate.

If my local government were easily accessible to me (and I do agree  
that our product needs to be very approachable), I would probably be  
completely apathetic toward the part of government that develops the  
community sports programs. I just don't care about that topic. I would  
be content to let others make those decisions for the community...  
especially if their decisions had to be self-funded.

Yet if I suddenly got involved in community sports and wanted to make  
some changes to the way my local programs were run, I would  
immediately be enfranchised to make my contribution to that part of  
the government. However, my reputation (score) in that section of  
government would be low, so I would have to have a particularly  
appealing idea in order to get people's attention.

When I first encountered Wikipedia, I was just amazed at the quality  
level it can achieve. The article on ants, for example, is both highly  
scientific and highly accessible to the average reader. Wikipedia  
isn't perfect, but its strength is that it is made only of useful  
contributions, not of *everybody's* contributions.
