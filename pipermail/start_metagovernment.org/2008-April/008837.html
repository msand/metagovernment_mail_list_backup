This is very similar to the concept of the Consensus Score for any  
particular resolution, just on a larger scale.

The idea of the consensus score is that once a proposition hits a  
certain critical mass of support, it is granted some (mathematical)  
inertia so that a small dip in support won't readily deactivate it.  
Then the only ways to change a law would be to either have a dramatic  
drop in support or for someone to come up with something better:  
something which synthesizes it.

I am wondering if we could develop both concepts at the same time. If  
the lifespan of a resolution and the lifespan of a governing body are  
both based on the same sort of math, then can we just have one formula?
