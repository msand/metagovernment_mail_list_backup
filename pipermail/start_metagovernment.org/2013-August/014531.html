<PRE>Do you mean that each action on the web page will result in an email to this 
mailing list, so that I can
1) stay informed and
2) reply with an email?

Hi Marc,

    Marc&gt; BUT, how can I take part in the decision, if you leave the
    mailing list for that?

Ned&gt; (I am probably not understanding your question ...) You would take
part in the decision by following the link, and then using the various
tools on the webpage to edit the argument outline. The page is like a
wiki-page in that anyone can collaborate in editing it.

When I left the page a little while ago, there was no green showing at
the top level, which means (kind of) that there are (temporarily) no
still-standing arguments in favor of using email as the locus for the
main functionality of the applications we will develop. (Actually, the
meaning is much fuzzier than that ...)

The design and functionality of the page is at its beginning; it is a
prototype. Through using it, we will discover what else it needs, and
may gain a clearer vision of what we want. And, maybe we can use it as
our tool through which to successfully reach consensus regarding the two
email questions that we are considering: (1) whether we will continue to
discuss and decide through the Metagovernment listserv (as our only tool
and medium), and (2) whether to put the main functionality of
applications we design into email.

Here is the link to the page:
