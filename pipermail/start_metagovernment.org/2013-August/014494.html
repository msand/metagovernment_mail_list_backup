<PRE>Hi all,

as I stated before, consensus is the tiranny of the minority. And of course, 
we know here in Belgium that they (the minority) uses this to get payd off 
because they have all kinds of &quot;legal&quot; (laws are made by politicians in this 
country) blocking systems installed. If you don't trust people to use their 
rights carefully, dont start with &quot;democracy&quot;.  And that is why Belgium will 
split. The &quot;majority&quot; is tired to be blackmailed.

Kind regards

Paul

Subject: Re: [MG] Defining consensus

Comrades, greetings

one of my &quot;keywords&quot; (Consensus) appeared in Ed's title. I haven't kept
up with any debate you're having on this issue so forgive me if I cover
ground you've already trodden.

I covered a potential algorithm for managing Dissent in one of my forum
posts back in 2007
<A HREF="https://fullmoon.nu/forum2013-import/viewtopic.php?p=868#p868">https://fullmoon.nu/forum2013-import/viewtopic.php?p=868#p868</A>

couple of things to note. First, if you choose to visit, please ignore
the &quot;invalid certificate&quot; warnings and add an exception. I've instituted
https to increase privacy (makes it harder for the snoops to learn what
you're visiting online) but I can't be arsed to pay for a &quot;legitimate&quot;
certificate.

Second, it's a long post, so if you're not particularly interested in
the debate I was having with &quot;the Prof&quot; over the merits of democracy,
search for
&quot;5 Prioritise Dissent&quot;. That'll take you straight to my proposed
algorithm.

Essentially, in my view, it is impractical, in a democractic debate to
aim for genuine consensus. (the complete absence of dissent) That is a
recipe for decision making paralysis.

What is practical is to afford priveleged status to dissent and to
insist that dissenting arguments are a) given full coverage and b) given
full and proper answers, preferably to the satisfaction of the dissenter
but at least to the satisfaction of the vast majority of those taking
part in the debate. (my preferred &quot;majority&quot; is at least 80, preferably
90%) and only when a dissenting objection is agreed by that majority to
have been satisfactorily answered, can the debated move on.

Another extremely important part of the solution to the consensus issue
is the target of &quot;Pareto Efficiency&quot; - the notion that no decision is
valid unless we can ensure that there are no losers and that at least
one person gains. In the case of dissent based on prospective loss, this
implies that the majority are obliged to compensate the dissenting
minority for any losses they incur as a result of the decision.

If Pareto Efficiency is not possible (loss is unavoidable, for example,
because the global economy has collapsed!) then the rule is modified so
that all losses are shared proportionately to the ability to sustain
loss.

Hope this is on topic and helps the debate.

Cheers

Harry

</I>&gt;<i> shifted my vote to Thomas, we had unanimity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Others decided to simply delegate. This wasn't just an abstaining
</I>&gt;<i> from decision-making. It was saying that they wanted to contribute to
</I>&gt;<i> the quorum of participants, but they trusted others to spend more time
</I>&gt;<i> and energy on the issue than themselves.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do have an issue with requiring effective unanimity (no unresolved
</I>&gt;<i> objections) as a definition of consensus. Look at the parallel thread
</I>&gt;<i> on this list. Mark appears to be coming from a completely different
</I>&gt;<i> angle than other recent participants on this list. Do you think you
</I>&gt;<i> can raise any proposal he wouldn't object to?

</I>&gt;<i> rule will not result in perfection, but on the other hand, striving
</I>&gt;<i> for perfection just isn't going to translate to success in the real
</I>&gt;<i> world.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Understood. (Which is why you suggested that the Rules page would be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a good foil for discussing the proposed bylaws.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; The decision rule there is set up to be 100% for small groups
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   and to gradually decrease down toward 80% as the group gets larger
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   (though that 80% standard can be tweaked). Yes, this is in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   opposition to your suggestion of no unresolved objections.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The difference in methods is much more fundamental and far reaching 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than a difference between 80% and 100%. The method on the Rules page uses 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting (popularity) to make decisions. The bylaws propose using 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> successive recursive proposing (discourse) to make decisions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bylaw #3 specifies that voting (popularity) will not be used at all in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making decisions. The number of people in favor of or against a proposal 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will not affect the decision, so there is really no point in even 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> counting how many are in favor and how many are opposed. There is no XX% 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision-rule. The popularity of the proposal does not determine the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   &quot;Communicative rationality&quot; is communication that is &quot;oriented to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   achieving, sustaining and reviewing consensus -- and indeed a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   consensus that rests on the intersubjective recognition of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   criticisable validity claims&quot;. A proposal constitutes such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   communication. A &quot;naked vote&quot; does not constitute such communication.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   A proposal submits itself to criticism and systematic examination
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   through discourse. A proposal presents good reasons to implement the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   proposal, or at least promises that good reasons exist and could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   requested. Even in the case that the proposal springs from a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   subjective preference, the subjective preference is publicly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   revealed, and may through discourse be counter-balanced, or balanced
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   in relation to wider consequences.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   A &quot;naked vote&quot; responds to a proposal without itself being a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   proposal. It has no rational discourse clothes on. It expresses a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   preference without presenting or promising reasons for that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   preference. It does not submit itself to criticism and systematic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   examination. It cannot effectively be challenged through rational
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   discourse, since it is but a raw, naked, inarticulate &quot;grunt&quot; of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   preference, that has its effect simply through being counted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Hereafter, when I say &quot;vote&quot; I mean &quot;naked vote&quot;.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; I do support consensus decision-making, but as Pietro noted much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   earlier, psychologists estimate that 1% to 4% of people are sociopaths.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Four percent of the population are sociopaths, and four percent are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;the wisest of the wise&quot;, who have knowledge and understanding and good 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will deep enough to enable them to create proposals that can make the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world wonderful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Using voting (popularity) as the basis for decisions cuts off both of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these extremes, with the result that decisions are made by the &quot;muddy 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> middle&quot; of the bell-shaped curve of understanding and good will. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Historically, decisions made by the muddy middle (through voting) have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not produced sustainable societies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Moreover, the sociopaths are much more adept at manipulating that muddy 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> middle than are the wisest of the wise. (The sociopaths will do anything; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the wise respect the free will of others, and are bound by scruples.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The best way to disempower the sociopaths is to have a decision system 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that allows anyone in the population to propose objections to their 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nefarious proposals. Nefarious proposals have difficulty surviving 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transparent rational discourse. Nefarious proposals have a much easier 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time winning propaganda-driven popularity contests, decided by voters who 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generally have only superficial understanding of the issues and are too

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; Making a 100% decision-rule for large-scale governance might be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   quite impractical.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; If the measure of &quot;practical&quot; is taken to be social system 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sustainability, then naked voting (using any decision-rule) has 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> historically shown itself to be impractical: 50% and 80% and 100% 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision-rules are all impractical, in the sense that they routinely 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> produce decisions that are not practical from the perspective of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sustainability.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Everybody agrees&quot; is not the same as &quot;nobody objects&quot;. Bylaws #3 and #4 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are not proposing that a 100% decision-rule be used. They are proposing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we abandon voting (popularity) as the basis for public decision 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making altogether, and switch to using proposing (discourse) as the basis 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for public decision making. When proposing is used as the basis, there is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no popularity decision-rule.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; We landed on 80% as an &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; and a reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   standard for consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; There is nothing reasonable about super-majority rule. There is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing reasonable about naked voting. Naked voting empowers the largest 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sufficiently large group to dictate to all individuals of the society 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (overriding their autonomy), with that group power unrestrained by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communicative rationality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; is not consensus. &quot;Overwhelming&quot; is a power 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> move, that is the opposite of reaching consensus, and that truncates the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process of reaching consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; But it can be changed by, well, 80% of the people deciding it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   should be changed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I agree. At the point that 80% of any population has understood that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> naked voting too often produces not-good-enough decisions (from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perspective of humanity, nature, and future generations), there will be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one last vote, on the proposal to abandon voting (popularity) and switch 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to proposing (discourse) as the basis for decision making.  :^)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Here you appear to be talking about different kinds of naked votes, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and different techniques for casting naked votes, and different 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> algorithms for counting naked votes. But what the bylaws propose is to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not have any naked voting at all as a formal technique of decision 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To use a bad analogy, you want people to be free to use any swimming 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stroke they want, while I am proposing that we climb out of the swimming

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; Different member groups do it differently. You may like your way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   better, but they may not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I do like my way better, and they do like their ways better. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Starting from that scattered state, if we can manage to work through our 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differences and reach consensus, we will be more able to potentially make 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the world better (world peace, abundance for all, environment protected, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> greater personal and public autonomy, etc.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can accomplish more if we work together. Diversity in decision making

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; The point of free-range voting is to allow people to participate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   in the way they are most comfortable, which should then be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   accommodating of whatever technique any system wants to use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I fully understand that naked voting is the /status quo/, and that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Great Question!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can produce better decisions more reliably than voting.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can provide greater public autonomy to each individual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     than voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can protect the interests of absentee stakeholders more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     reliably than voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can diffuse power more reliably and appropriately than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can be more transparent than voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can scale better than voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; In a well-crafted environment, isn't a naked vote really the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   same as proposing the same thing as what someone else has already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   proposed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Why would anyone want to propose again a proposal that has already 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been proposed? Any particular proposal only needs to be proposed once.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; Instead of re-proposing their exact text, one can just +1 it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The idea is to have each proposal pass or fail based on whether it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can survive criticism and systematic examination through discourse. It is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a bad idea to have each proposal pass or fail based upon its popularity 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> among people who spend six seconds reading the title and then decide 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether to click the &quot;+1&quot; button.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; No. There is no translating technique between naked voting and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposing. The terms are defined as being exclusive alternatives, like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;swimming&quot; and &quot;walking&quot;. The contexts of the techniques differ. The 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> techniques themselves are qualitatively different.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Proposing happens within the context of discourse. Naked voting (by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> definition) happens outside of the context of discourse. The vote has its 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effect through being counted, not through being presented in discourse to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others who may respond and challenge it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In this email exchange, you and I are engaging in discourse (each

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   right? I just want to point out that we have two other branches that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   overlap with what you're presenting:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   For adding on another layer as you propose, I think it may be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   helpful to address each of your points below in a separate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   conversation. There's a lot of weighty stuff there, and each point
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   should probably be examined by the group.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes! I wholeheartedly agree: there is lots of overlap, and each point 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;should&quot; be examined by the group. (But I don't quite understand what 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you mean by &quot;adding on another layer&quot; ...)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The relations of the proposed bylaws to the material of the &quot;Mission 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and Vision&quot; page are complex, but mostly the points of the two 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposals seem (to me) to be compatible. (If you see conflicts, by all 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> means point them out.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, bylaws #3 and #4 stand in direct opposition to the decision 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> method of the &quot;Rules&quot; page. That might be a good place to start. What 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problems do you have with switching from &quot;naked voting&quot; to proposing as 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the means through which individuals participate in decision making? 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (Perhaps start a new thread dedicated to that conversation?)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What follows is a first draft of proposed bylaws for &quot;an organization

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The draft also exists as a wiki-page:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  1. *MEMBERSHIP: UNCOERCED*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Any sentient being (globally) may freely choose to become a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> member
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     of the society. Any member may freely choose to cease to be a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     member of the society.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  2. *DECISION MAKING: DIRECT DEMOCRACY*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Each member of the society is free to participate in making any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     decision that the society makes. Each member participates in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     decision making on equal footing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     (Emergency decisions are made through a subordinate emergency
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     response system. Any member may participate in the post-emergency
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     reviews of decisions made during emergencies.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  3. *PARTICIPATION: THROUGH PROPOSING*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Members participate in decision making exclusively through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     making.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  4. *DECISION RULE: NO UNRESOLVED OBJECTIONS
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     *
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     The decision rule is that a proposal is cleared to be implemented
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     at the point that it faces no unresolved objections. Objections
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     are proposed. Objections are resolved through successive,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     recursive proposing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  5. *NOTIFICATION: PROPOSAL PROFILES, PROPOSAL MAGNETS*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Effecting direct democracy at the scale of the global population
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     requires that the decision system have an affordable sub-system
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     that reliably notifies each member of new proposals that may be 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     interest, and that avoids inundating individuals with new
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     proposals not of interest. The details of the software and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     practices that will together effect efficient and reliable global
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     notification will be co-created and evolved through successive
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     successful proposing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  6. *APPLYING PAST DECISIONS: APPRAISAL*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     In order for the decision system to be affordable and reliable at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     the scale of the global population, it must have a sub-system 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     efficiently and reliably applies all relevant past decisions to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     each new proposal that is submitted. (The past decisions serve as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     filters; each new proposal must successfully &quot;pass through&quot; all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     such filters in order to be cleared for implementation.) The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     details of the software and practices that will together effect
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     this will be co-created and evolved through successive successful
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     proposing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  7. *AMENDMENTS: THROUGH PROPOSING*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Additions and amendments to these bylaws may be effected through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     successfully proposing.
