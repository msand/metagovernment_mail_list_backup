</I>&gt;<i> Alex, I very much agree with you that social arrangements that maintain
</I>&gt;<i> and increase concentration of wealth/power are problems to be solved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To the extent that a particular corporation &quot;succeeds&quot; (from the
</I>&gt;<i> perspective of its owners), wealth/power are concentrated (in the
</I>&gt;<i> corporation, and in the owners of the corporation). This is not a problem
</I>&gt;<i> from the perspective of the corporation, but is a problem from the
</I>&gt;<i> perspective of the rest of humanity, and nature, and future generations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't quite understand what leads you think that tinkering with the
</I>&gt;<i> rules of equity (within corporations) will solve the problems that
</I>&gt;<i> corporations keep causing for the world as a whole (poverty, war,
</I>&gt;<i> environmental destruction, etc.). Each corporation will still be narrowly
</I>&gt;<i> pursuing its own interests, with the rest of us having no choice but to

</I>&gt;<i> corporate predations. (We have been trusting The Invisible Hand for the
</I>&gt;<i> last few hundred years, and things have not been going so well ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Its difficult to answer.
What is &quot;the invisible hand&quot;? This is to fuzzy to me to really respond.
If people do nothing, contracts or equity rules will first make those
without equity suffer,
because the shareholders will squeeze them out to reduce &quot;variable costs&quot;.
At some point in time, the money system will take over, because existing
contracts, mainly serving liabilities has precedence over serving equity,
the shareholders will be squeezed out in favor of the money owners....
(think my english is not that good, but hope u can follow the thought)
Some corporations can go without debt, but only because other corporations
or the government or private households are loaded with that debt instead.
no having any debt as a corporation is not a solution that could be applied
by the average corporation.
...but then again, i think its a waste of time to argue about money or
complain about money, because in my view, the only lever which exists that
could be potentially used to tackle money, is equity :-)

You already summarized my idea in a couple of bullet points.
Could you be more precise of what u dont understand? Maybe its easier then
for me to respond more specifically.


------------------------------**------------------------------**------------
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; I think, because people are not used to this, it's not easy to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    sell the idea and people will be very sceptical in the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is pretty easy to predict that the people who will most skeptical will
</I>&gt;<i> be the richest people in the world. Any particular startup can indeed
</I>&gt;<i> choose to &quot;spread the wealth&quot; internally, but then the richest people will
</I>&gt;<i> back competitors to the startup that give them better equity deals, and
</I>&gt;<i> will instruct their captured politicians and regulators to make trouble for
</I>&gt;<i> any startup that presumes to try to &quot;spread the wealth&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>


I wasnt talking about the rich people with lots of power. I was talking
about the average worker. They will be very sceptical in the beginning.
You are right, that those people who own so much right now might be
sceptical too, and maybe with good reason, but maybe they will even support
it, because they themselves are trapped in the rules of the system. Some of
them might know, some or most of them might not know.




&gt;<i> As Paul suggested, &quot;binary economics&quot; presents arrangements that are very
</I>&gt;<i> close to what you are suggesting. The CESJ organization (that has been
</I>&gt;<i> promulgating binary economics) has been in business since 1984, as yet
</I>&gt;<i> without much success (you and I had never even heard of them). If you want
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;real effects NOW&quot;, starting with trying to change the rules of equity
</I>&gt;<i> within corporations may not be the best choice. The attempt would be
</I>&gt;<i> unlikely to succeed against the opposition of the richest people in the
</I>&gt;<i> world, and even if it did succeed, the world would still be at the mercy of
</I>&gt;<i> successful corporations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes.
1. I see no other way, even if what i propose isnt easy to do
2. What a corporation is, will change with those new rules established
3. Rich people have no way of opposing, because talent will be attracted to
the new way, all you have to do is provide the rules which enable &quot;working
together efficiently&quot; while having greater benefits than working for a
traditional corporation. (benefits mean: earn more money, have more power
(because of shares))




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; But there's also the problems of how people will decide,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    because if there is many shareholders, the problem of how to
</I>&gt;<i>    establish good democratic pratices supported by the proper tools,
</I>&gt;<i>    follows immediately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> YES! My view is that in order to really solve &quot;the problems of
</I>&gt;<i> concentrated power&quot;, we need to create, demonstrate, and popularize a full
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy, that is capable of rendering corporations obsolete,
</I>&gt;<i> globally. (Because people are not used to this, it's not easy to sell the
</I>&gt;<i> idea and people will be very skeptical in the beginning ...) :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

YES! ..and NO! :-)
&quot;popularize a full direct democry&quot; ... YES!
&quot;capable of rendering corporations obsolete&quot; ....WHAT? :-)
I dont know your definition of corporation, but democracy mainly happens on
the street through spending money or not on certain things, and it happens
every day during work time.
you do what your boss tells you to do and if you are a &quot;good worker&quot;, then
ur boss might give u a bit more power, so u can tell other people what to
do.
The good thing with this is, that there is a tendency that those in power
make better and more &quot;grown up&quot; decisions than those not in power, because
they will be only brought into power if they seem to understand what they
are doing, but on the other hand, they also act in their own best interest
and maybe their bosses interest  and those who dont do will not be brought
into power.

So if u really want people to experience DIRECT DEMOCRACY, bring it to
money (i believe thats currently not possible yet) and bring it to the
40hours of work u do every week.
Thats where people experience democracy and thats where they can start to
grow up until they eventually end up in washington ;-)
First, workers, through equity, get control of their work environment and
they have to collaborate with their coworkers which then will be coowners.
Then they start to take over the supply chains, that means democratic
corporations will work together... then they will clim up further, and
every times its all the average people and their 40h work. they will not be
workers anymore, they will be owners or co-owners. ..p2p-owners?

So you do not build DIRECT DEMOCRACY as an architecture designed by some
smart academics as a system and a software which then will be brought upon
the masses in a top-down-fashion, NO :-) it has to start small, in the real
world, in every persons personal every-day-life, that means &quot;during work
hours&quot; and &quot;during money spending hours&quot;
the first needs the rules of equity to be changed.
the second needs the rules of money to be changed, but the second is very
hard to tackle, so i propose one should try to tackle equity first and
because money is in part based on equity, if equity changes, it might make
the money system vulnerable so that it can be tackled too.







&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to decide to change the rules of equity, or the rules of money,
</I>&gt;<i> or any other rules, we need a new decision system through which to decide
</I>&gt;<i> such things. That has to come first. We need to decide, together, how we
</I>&gt;<i> are going to decide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

YES! :-)
But i think its a waste of time to think of &quot;nation wide government&quot; or
even only &quot;community government&quot; ... i heard people complain about that
people are not interested in discussing stuff, or tool which LACK PEOPLE
who want to discuss things...
You know why? Because what people do 40h a week is a job. A job is were
democracy happens or most commonly NOT. Its where it has to start.
Bring democracy to the average work environment. A software that enables
people to democratically decide on where, how, what ...and the like... they
work.

The work people do every day is what they have insight into and what they
are familiar with.
Help them to argue about it and make them owners of their personal work
environment.
After some time, their self esteem will increase and they might feel
comfortable to tackle the next layer in the hierarchy in a democratic
fashion. It will grow bottom up and so will the tools.

Its easier to create a tool and make people us it, when you start with a
startup or a project team and make it work, then you try to enable it for
larger teams and small established companies, then you try to make it work
for several teams and several small companies which work together in a
network.
then you try to make it word for average sized companies and so on... and
it will grow.
bottom up and the software will evolve through the experience which is
gained on the way.




&gt;<i> (&quot;We&quot; means you and me and Paul and Stephen and Conseo and Ed and Pietro
</I>&gt;<i> and Mike and the other members of the Metagovernment community and then
</I>&gt;<i> others in the broader e-dem population, and so on. We talk about the
</I>&gt;<i> importance of starting at the community level, but then we don't do it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>

Yes, and i believe its WRONG to start at the community level. The
&quot;community level&quot; is far to BIG for the average person. Its a myth or fairy
tale which is told in elementary school.
In reality, the &quot;community level&quot; is integrated into the &quot;economic system&quot;
and it depends on the &quot;public institution&quot; or &quot;community size&quot; which
&quot;lobbiests&quot; are interested in that comunity and which managers or
politicians act on which interestes. Those interests are not the direct
interests of those people who meet and talk (politicians at the community
level + company managers + several others) ...in short: agents which
represent some kind of &quot;partial collective will&quot; (so to say, i know my
words are sometimes a bit strange, but its because i lack good english
skills).

So the ONLY &quot;domain&quot; average people know about is their every day life. Its
the &quot;domain&quot; where they have good knowledge and can make decisions. It has
to start THERE, then give them feedback, so they will learn and at some
point, they will grow to the &quot;next level&quot; and if they have taken several
levels, at some point, they will arrive at the COMMUNITY LEVEL, together
with all the other citizens which might use similar processes and tools at
their work place to self govern it all They will then start to discuss
community issues, because they will know about the challanges... :-)
...then it will go beyond the community level, but starting with the
community level is wrong.
better start in peoples every day life, which is the work environment.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Hi Alex,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It seems that you have the makings for starting a startup: a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;founder team&quot; that offers the service of setting up other new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     startups in the manner you suggest. The success of those other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     startups that used your arrangements and practices would then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     provide validation of the arrangements and practices, at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     from the perspective of each startup (though not necessarily from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the perspective of society as a whole, or nature, or future
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     generations).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I went through what you wrote and tried to pick out the problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that you are trying to solve. Here is what I came up with:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * The richest keep becoming richer because they can sit back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           and let the structure work for them once they have invested.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * To not let them sit back, there needs to be a &quot;social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           process&quot; within the startup of constantly evaluating results
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           to measure progress.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * Given such an internal process, it is then possible to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           arrange that shares can &quot;waste away&quot; if the shareholder is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           not continually doing work to help the startup.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * This would in turn enable everyone in the startup to be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           shareholder (creating and maintaining shareholdings through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           working), so that compensation would be in the form of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           dividend paid to shares held, rather than in the form of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           wages or salaries.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * In such a system, the richest (initial investors) would no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           longer have a free ride forever after the initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           investment, which would be fairer, and would over time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           spread wealth away from the richest toward those who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           actually do the work.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     _3 Techniques which are already best practices in their domain_
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     *TECHNIQUE 1*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     There is a method called &quot;Business Model Canvas&quot;, which is a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     top-down-view of a startup which you draw on a canvas with your
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     team (could also be done digitally).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Then you attach hypotheses and their tests (todo's for the team)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     to every area of the company (partners, (activities+ressources),
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     product, (channels, relations) customers) and work through them
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     during the next week.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     So you ITERATE through this process generating business model
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     canvas after business model canvas, making progress visible, + it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     helps to not lose focus.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     *TECHNIQUE 2*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     There is a methodology called &quot;agile management technique&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     one of them is called scrum. Most software developers should be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     familiar with it. Within scum, there is a technique called
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;PLANNING POKER&quot; which is some kind of card game you run through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     before each 2-week-sprint-iteration (which means 2 weeks of doing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     work) to upfront try to estimate how many tasks you could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     accomplish from an priorityqueue of features/tasks.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     *TECHNIQUE 3*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Financial Bookkeeping and Depreciation. Where many &quot;accounts&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     exists and you update them for each business transaction and you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     also calculate the depreciation over time, so you know your &quot;true
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     costs&quot; because you have to bear &quot;replacement investments&quot; in mind.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     *PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Now if you use all those 3 techniques, you will eventually end up
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     with a process, where a digital business model canvas can give
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     transparencey to all participants about the current state of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     company. Combined with the Planning Poker Approach, its possible
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     to measure progress or do some kind of bookkeeping or point
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     system, where you measure how much all your points are worth and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     after each iteration you could reevaluate in retrospective to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     what degree your assumptions became true and this practice will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     sharpen everyones ability to make such guesses (learning process).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Now if you also account for depreciation (some todo's, like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     results of &quot;a customer interview&quot; or &quot;cleaning a room&quot; will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     depreciate faster than a bought &quot;office table&quot;), you could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     calculate an average rate of depreciation with which earned
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     points waste away.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Then there is also those points who have to be &quot;written off&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     after you did some kind of work which turned out to be a waste of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     time.... ...but the process of this is weaved into the CORE
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     TECHNIQUE (with business model canvas) around which you build
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     everything else and which helps you to keep focus.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     *What does it mean? And how is this related to the &quot;STATUS QUO&quot;?*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     1. Now, what if i buy an office chair and give it &quot;points&quot; during
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     a weekly planning poker session? The &quot;office chair&quot; also has a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     value in &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot;. If many companies will do this approach,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     you essentially get an &quot;exchange rate&quot; between your companies
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     internal point system and &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot; and the like.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     2. What if this process works well, why not make these points
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     REAL SHARES? And if you do so, why not make everyones SHARES
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     waste away with the average rate of depreciation, so that people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     have to re-invest, in order to not lose all their shares over
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     time? (=&gt; This will essentially make all this equity agreements
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     or &quot;VESTING&quot; rules kind of superfluous, because if someone
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     decides to quit and doesnt want to sell his shares, they will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     waste away over time)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Why should I invest work in earning shares if they waste away???
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Because as long as you have shares, they decide on a potentially
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;real time basis&quot; how much of the companies revenue (in USD or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     EUR or the like...) goes into your pocket. So you dont work for a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     wage, but for those points which eventually are shares and which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     will decide your monetary income flow (potentially minutely
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     dividends)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     IF this techniques, which in practice should make the average
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     person better off, becomes mainstream practice (which is totally
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     possible, because if there are role models who work this way
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     successfully, it will spread virally, because it will mean more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     money and more power with less work for everyone beside the top
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     1%, but it has to start bottom-up and success of practicioners
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     will automatically spread it and make it a mainstream practice.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     ... THEN: shareholders will lose equity over time to those who
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     are actively doing the work, which makes the rules fair again.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     And because everyone or every company will create their &quot;point
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     system&quot; which will end up having an exchange rate in EUR/USD,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     they all get used to this and it will or might lay a foundation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     to tackle the monetary system as such, but for now, this is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     totally of reach.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             Equity gives you votes in the context of your equity.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             I came to the conclusion, that the rules/laws around
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             money are broken and so are the rules around equity.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             Do you know the forbes magazine and their listing of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             100 richest persons on the planet? 98 of them are

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             last one, i dont know.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             If you want to get insanely rich, u have to abuse the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             The other way would be to get into the financial
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             industrie and instead of abusing broken equity rules, u
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             would abuse broken money laws.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             In essence it eneables you to live of of other peoples
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             work to some degree.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             These broken laws are the main, if not the ONLY reason

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>             I believe money is an issue that cannot be tackled right
