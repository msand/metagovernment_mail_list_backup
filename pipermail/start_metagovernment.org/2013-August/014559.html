<PRE>Hi Marc, (Great Discussion Tagging! A joy to read, indeed! :^)

My understanding was that Daniel was not suggesting that we try to 
formalize informal discussion. One reason for migrating our informal 
discussion to a forum is that the forum platform can provide better 
support for informal discussion (which we would greatly benefit from in 
my view ...).

No one is suggesting that we abandon email. For notification, email is 
arguably the best option that we have available (for now).

Beyond that, it is possible, as you say, to do amazing things in email 
-- it is not impossible. But trying to pack all of the functionality 
into emails would be like trying to build ships in bottles -- which is 
also possible. The question is, what course of design and development 
seems most likely to give us the best return on our investment of time 
and other resources.

(And also, the discussion of whether to try to pack application 
functionality into emails has already been formalized, at 
<A HREF="http://allangles.co/Demo.html?id=14">http://allangles.co/Demo.html?id=14</A> . To me, it appears that all of the 
arguments to try to use email that way got soundly rebutted over there. 
If you think otherwise, it would be good for you to hop over there and 
rebut the rebuttals, and advance new reasons to try to pack fancy 
functionality into emails.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree with you that it would be good to have a rule that says: &quot;Keep 
it as short and simple as possible, but not shorter and simpler.&quot;

I also agree that it might be useful to formulate a set of such rules to 
apply to discussion messages -- I look forward to reading your proposed 
set of rules.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Daniel&gt; First, I suggest we transition our discussions to a
</I>&gt;<i>    forum-like platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Yes. My impression is that you, Harry, and others that have all the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate expertise are in agreement about this. And I agree that
</I>&gt;<i> trying to parse and otherwise play with emails is not worth the effort,
</I>&gt;<i> particularly at the prototype stage. As you say: &quot;That way we can focus
</I>&gt;<i> on the correctness of a reference implementation as a web platform and
</I>&gt;<i> later start pushing features down other channels (email, mobile, voice,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.).&quot; Exactly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Daniel&gt; All of these things could be done separately but in our
</I>&gt;<i>    case, I believe two conditions are necessary to actually set things
</I>&gt;<i>    in motion :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Build and contribute to something that is in *real use*. If we can
</I>&gt;<i>    manage to eat our own dog food, not only will it taste sweeter for
</I>&gt;<i>    those who produce it but I'm positive we'll have even more success
</I>&gt;<i>    selling it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Build a free discussion and informal communication platform and
</I>&gt;<i>    make it the foundation for any other system. Collaborative
</I>&gt;<i>    governance ultimately is all about building a model for
</I>&gt;<i>    transitioning from INFORMAL to FORMAL, be it ideas, statements,
</I>&gt;<i>    arguments, decisions, action plans, etc. It all starts with an
</I>&gt;<i>    informal discussion even at the highest levels of formalism (how
</I>&gt;<i>    would you go about proposing a change in the constitution if not by
</I>&gt;<i>    first expressing your thoughts with your own words in an informal
</I>&gt;<i>    context ?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Yes. In my view, you nailed it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Daniel&gt; Let me know what you think about all this and if we can
</I>&gt;<i>    settle on a course of action, I can start working on a migration plan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The initial course of action that you have suggested seems good to
</I>&gt;<i> me: set up a forum-like platform, move our discussions there, and have
</I>&gt;<i> the forum send emails back to the list. Then, as topics emerge through
</I>&gt;<i> informal discussion that are ready to be formalized and decided, their
</I>&gt;<i> discussion moves to settings such as AllAngles, which are integrated
</I>&gt;<i> parts of our evolving overall platform.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, I suggest we transition our discussions to a forum-like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform. The mailing list would remain active and posts on the forum 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would all be published as individual messages on the ML. The handling 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of posts to the ML is slightly more complicated and depends 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (initially at least) on the set of modules that are available for the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forum software. Parsing mail content especially when trying to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correlate with upstream messages and trying to identify and extract 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user content, quotes, formatting, etc. is not an easy feat (I've been 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there). A solution that is much more affordable to start with would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be to enhance the messages by embedding links for the various actions 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (view details, reply, +1, etc.). That way we can focus on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correctness of a reference implementation as a web platform and later 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start pushing features down other channels (email, mobile, voice, etc.).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With almost no extra effort, the forum can at least allow us to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create some structure by segmenting the conversations across 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> categories and topics and by providing a threaded view in the web 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Second, well ... we'd have what I believe would be a minimally viable 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform for experimentation. A platform that would actually be *in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use* since our &quot;real&quot; discussions would be conducted on it. Through 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> small increments and iterations, we can move towards a rich discourse 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> / debate / collaborative reasoning platform :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Integration with a wiki / publishing platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Argumentation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Decision formalization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Integration with external e-gov tools and platforms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Integration with a ticket-like system for the delegation of tasks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Identity management (SSO, reward system, karma, membership 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certification - badges, privacy, etc.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All of these things could be done separately but in our case, I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe two conditions are necessary to actually set things in motion :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
