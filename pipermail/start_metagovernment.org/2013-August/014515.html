&gt;<i> I've started a new thread on this as I think it is different from the
</I>&gt;<i> conceptual discussion on consensus into a technology platform discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Alexander, please correct me if I misunderstood but I believe you are
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting that we should use email as the standard for most collaboration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes and no.
yes, in the sense, that we should start with building upon the email
technology
no, that we should not use email as is, but use the possibilities of
mainstream email clients, to enhance email into something more useful.
why do this? ...not because email is such a nice technology, but because
all people who use the internet use emails too, probably on a very frequent
basis, thus it makes participation dead simple to integrate into peoples
daily routines and that is important when it comes to participation.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was proposing a prototype which has no bearing on the final technology platform. The criteria for choosing a prototype is ease of development and flexibility because it would all be re-written for production. To try and create an email service for a prototype would increase the difficulty and reduce the speed of exploration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>no. there is hundreds and thousands of software projects which come up with
all kinds of clever prototype ideas to improve discussion and
participation, but they never become &quot;real production software&quot;. All the
concepts  do exist in various forms and prototypes out there, more or less
usable.
A software/prototype, build on email will have not many features but it can
grow into something bigger when people start using it... not because its
the most feature rich, but its easy to integrate into the daily routine and
its better then what currently exists elsewhere, and again (important) its
easy to integrate into ones daily routine without much effort.


I have developed email services before but I can not think of any way
this type of structure could be implemented completely in email. If
you would provide a description of what you want I will have a look to
see if I can do it.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>all email clients these days (which are used by mainstream normal people)
have some capabilities of using HTML5 (html,css,javascript).
A friend of mine does nothing else at work then create &quot;email advertising
campaigns&quot; which make use of this. If you google for (responsive design
email) or something, you get lots of input. I guess there no &quot;email webapp&quot;
yet, but to some degree such a thing is possible, at least its possible
(the same way as its possible to automatically append a mailinglist footer
to any emails send over a mailinglist), to integrate some kind of
html/css/javascript which makes it easy to interactively engage in
discussion and give it structure, without having to manually take care of
that...





&gt;<i> I have not used listserv (or similar) software for years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>look at the &quot;nodejs&quot; community, which takes &quot;javascript to the serverside&quot;,
making it a full blown programming language. look at &quot;npmjs.org&quot; which has
thousands and thousands of javascript libraries for all kinds of tasks,
which include EMAIL and even something like &quot;javascript git&quot; :-) so many
things are rewritten in javascript and software like &quot;browserify&quot; and
others make those things available IN THE BROWSER too....
...its the fastest growing language/programming environment that has ever
existed in history. It took &quot;nodejs&quot; only about 3 years to grow bigger than
the python community/environment which has been around for 20-30 years now
and it will soon bypass &quot;ruby on rails&quot; too.






&gt;<i> No one I now in real life uses listserve (or similar) software currently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>EVERYONE i know uses email.
MANY i know have subscribed to mailinglists at some point in time or at
least to &quot;newsletters&quot;. Probably all people have received html-emails at
least once in their lifetime... and whats  an interactive website inside an
email? its the possibility to create a useful discussion software.
nobody would normally try to build an app for email, but it makes sense,
because thats where people are and even in the days of &quot;MOBILE&quot;, people
still read their emails on their phones.... email will not die, because of
the &quot;network effect&quot;, but it can eventually grow into something more
advanced the same way the web grows into something more advanced all the
time...



&gt;<i> My son tells me that none of his peers use email anymore except when forced to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>yes, BUT :-) your son is young and the majority of people use it and so
does he.
the corporate world is a slow world, because its run by older people than
your son.
it will take a long time until your son and his peers will run the world.
when it comes to school or when it comes to apllying for university or an
internship or a job, he has to use EMAIL.
when he signs up to a service, that might be twitter, facebook, or
whatever, the BASIC FALLBACK MECHANISM is email, without an email, you can
NEVER register for these services... email is somehow part of the
foundation of the web.



&gt;<i> My work is transitioning to online websites for most of the collaboration. Email will always be used for some communication where it serves best.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>why do we use email here?
why do parties use mailinglists?
why do companies complain about having to read to such huge amounts of
emails on a daily basis?
email is everywhere and people have often told that it will die in the
future, but IT WONT.
The network effect will prevent that and not other medium is as widely used
as email, when it comes to communicating with lots of people which u dont
know.
...because its easy to join a mailinglist
...because its easy to subscribe to newsletters
...because its easy to add new email adresses as receipients to an email
and because not all people have twitter or facebook or google+ or whatever,
but EVERYONE has EMAIL :-)

If you want to include them all (and thats what metagovernment is all about
somehow)...
The &quot;Lowest Common Denominator&quot; is email :-P






&gt;<i> The majority of information and interaction for the people I know (regardless of  technical aptitude) is on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, search engines, StackExchanges and services. They use email mostly for one way communication from an organization or periodic two way communication between small groups or individuals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The pirate party runs on emails and a wiki. (and currently its probably the
largest community on the planet which tries to discuss proposals and decide
upon them) ... and they use mailinglists :-) ...for a reason

If you want more than 50 or 100 people to communicate, would u use facebook?
nope, not everyone has it, not all would join. on some plattforms u can
attach files, on others u cant, on some u have only 140 chars, on some u
have more...




&gt;<i> most applications today use email at some point and so would all my proposed designs. Email has it's use and it's place but I disagree that it should be the main collaboration method.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>We use email and for sure, &quot;raw email&quot; is always relatively unstructured
and chaotic, but it should not be email as such on which one builds a
&quot;grass roots democracy plattform&quot;, but use the possibilities of html5
(html,css,javascript) to enhance email into something more.
Not because its easy to do it, but because its where all the people are.




&gt;<i> I do not see the value in limiting our exploration of a new path for government to a single technology. Thousands of attempts will fail but if one works then we have an improvement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its not limiting oneself to it, but using it as a starting point.
</I>If people use it because its easy to integrate into their daily routine,
then you can sync emails with a forum (like the pirate party already does)
...you could extend and plug in other mechanisms as the community grows and
even develop stand alone software to use the &quot;democracy web&quot; in more
sophisticated ways than its possible with email alone.

Think about twitter :-)
For sure, you could use twitter through their website alone, nevertheless,
various twitter clients exist, which allow for much more sophisticated use
of twitter. twitter even provides an API to do very special things with it.
So what i'm suggesting is building upon email in order to make it as easy
as possible for people to integrate it into their daily routines and follow
topics and the like to gain momentum, and further down that road, we could
provide API's or specialized client software to make use of all of this in
a more sophisticated way.




&gt;<i> I would like to hear the opinions of the others on this list. Is Alexander's opinion a majority?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Probably not yet, but i hope i can make it clear why its so important to
use email.
Make a list of technology (ex. email, webbrowser, twitter, facebook,
googleplus, etc...)
Go ask all the people you know which they do use.
ask your son, but ask friends of ur son too, ask their teachers, ask your
colleagues, ask your grandparents, your friends, ask people in the
supermarket, ask people at ur sports or chess or whatever club, ask people
on the street, ask people u meet on vacation.

Then write down what they use. may i guess, that email and webbrowser will
dominate the others BY &quot;A LOT&quot; :-)

Each statement for or against can also be affected by*&gt;&gt;* statements for or against it in a hierarchy.
