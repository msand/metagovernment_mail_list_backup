<PRE>Alex and Marc,

Alex said:
&gt;<i> .. one could argue, that we already have such a system in place, and
</I>&gt;<i> its called the internet.
</I>
I think the solution depends on the net's infrastructure, but isn't
identical with the net itself.  The net supports other patterns of
solution that are broadly different from what's proposed in this
(ridiculously titled) thread.  An app that serves primarily to earn
rents for its producers is, for example, unlikely to *also* serve
primarily to support informal discussion here, there and everywhere.
Likewise an app that serves primarily to benefit its users is unlikely
to *equally* benefit informal participants, who are (by definition)
non-users.  These two examples might cover the bulk of internet usage.
So it's not the net itself that's proposed, nor a typical net app. *

&gt;<i> What would be the first step, one would have to take towards YOUR
</I>&gt;<i> VISION, if one had to start from where one is currently based
</I>&gt;<i> (EMAIL). :-P
</I>
Marc said:
&gt;<i> ...  To enable this, first you might define at least one feature of
</I>&gt;<i> the magic that happen, [requirements for email enhancement], so that
</I>&gt;<i> you can define an interface upon it.
</I>
Maybe the first requirement to define is the particular aspect of the
informal discussion to formalize.

   informal, actual
      discussion                                formal image
   ----------------       --- magic 1 ---&gt;   ------------------
    (here, there      &lt;--- magic 2 ---       (elsewhere, remote
   and everywhere)                             corner of net)

I guess we want to formalize the logical argumentive structure of the
discussion.  But that's a fuzzy goal.  It would be better to have a
concrete example of a formal argument to look at, and to study its
utility.  What makes it useful to people?  What especially makes it
useful to people *other* than those who formalized it?

&gt;<i> Probably you might implement a proxy between the user (currently
</I>&gt;<i> reading this email) and the magic that happen somewhere on the
</I>&gt;<i> internet.  ...
</I>
We must be careful however that the proxy (or whatever connector we
choose) doesn't turn all email users into users of the formalizing
facility, especially not via magic 1.  They would then cease to be
informal participants, undermining the actuality of the argument to
some degree.  The formalization would then become (to that degree)
empty, ungrounded and unreal.  We first need to form a high-fidelity
image of the *actual* argument that's happening out there in the real
world.  I'm not sure how to do that.

Also our focus on email is a potential problem.  Email isn't the only
possible medium of argument, ofc.  If we restrict magic 1 to email,
then our view of the informal argument (the actuality) is distorted by
this arbitrary, formal restriction of medium, and again it slips
toward unreality.  To resolve a clear image of the informal argument
would require viewing it through an array of discussion media;
necessarily magic 1 is a *cross-formal* lense.

I know of possible solutions (magics 1 and 2) for several cases of
formalization other than argument structure: namely overall bounds of
discussion (where and when it happens); subjective structure of
agreement and disagreement (who agrees, etc); and objective structure
(what's being talked about, agreed to, etc).  But although I think
it's do-able, I haven't tried to solve it for the argumentive case.
I've only been using that case to help tease out this &quot;magic&quot; pattern
of interrelation.  I'm writing a summary with diagrams, which I'll
share when it's ready, maybe in a week or two.  (If I don't discover
along the way that I'm chasing nonsense.)


  * It does seem to have something of the selfless, expansive utility
    of the internet; or of any public communication infrastructure,
    such as a road network.  But although it depends partly on the
    internet (and partly on roads I guess), it cannot be bound by
    either, nor by any artificial form.  For instance it must apply to
    face-to-face discussions that are conducted on the street without
    the support of any device except human language.  I guess this is
    the ultimate test: a single individual speaks on the street (or in
    a Ukrainian cow shed, or a Dominican sugar plantation) and thereby
    changes the course of civilization.  Possibly she (or he) remains
    unaware of this larger effect; possibly she is only a child of 13
    years.  The means by which her informal utterance works its
    guidance (if it should) is the solution we're talking about.  It's
    a solution purposely designed for the amplification of the true
    signal of humanity and its guidance of power.  It's a hifi, human
    preamp that we can plug into society's power amps.  But it's not a
    power amp in itself.  It won't turn our 13-year old into a
    monster; she remains an innocent child.  This is the magic.

Mike
