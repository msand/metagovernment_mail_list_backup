Well, I think such objections would still be votes.  In form they'd be
both objections *and* votes.  Participants would then have to choose
what content to put in them.  But those who naively used them to
express reasons would be roundly defeated by those who instead used
them to express votes and to force the decision one way or another.
A system that was intended for reasoned argument would then break down
into a system of brute force decision.  Do you see what I mean?

However we choose to define consensus, we want it to arise from the
&quot;unforced force of the better argument&quot; (Habermas).  That won't be
possible if we get it mixed up with decision systems, which are
necessarily media of brute force.  Why not drop the function of
decision making entirely and fall back to rational discourse?  That's
really all that's needed.  The world has plenty of systems for forcing
decisions on people, but few supports for reasoned discussion.

And if we don't attempt to glue reasoned discussion (open and free) to
decision making (centralized and forced), then we needn't jam everyone
into the same discussion medium.  Harry and friends can continue using
Web forums, while Alex and friends continue using email, and so forth.
No need to argue (as in the other thread) which is &quot;better&quot;.

&gt;<i> How about a prototype website instead of using email or plugins. I think I
</I>&gt;<i> could work something up quickly. Would someone put together a short
</I>&gt;<i> requirement list like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    - A User can enter an issue
</I>&gt;<i>    - Users can create proposals to solve the issue
</I>&gt;<i>    - Users can create objections to the proposals
</I>&gt;<i>    - Objections are voted on? (I'm a little lost here)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would prefer a system that has no voting at all. I have a prototype of a
</I>&gt;<i> way to decide if a proposal should succeed that does not use voting.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of voting people add reasons for or against passage of the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal. Each statement for or against can also be affected by statements
</I>&gt;<i> for or against it in a hierarchy. An objection could be made against the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal but then other people could object to the objection, for example,
</I>&gt;<i> by adding a statement that the objection is a logical fallacy. The system

</I>&gt;<i> You can see an example at <A HREF="http://AllAngles.co/13">http://AllAngles.co/13</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I look forward to seeing where the conversation goes.
