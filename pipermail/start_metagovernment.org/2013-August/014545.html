<PRE>Mike, Greetings! (I am very glad to see that you have finished your 
resting!) :^)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Bentley&gt; ... An objection could be made against the proposal but
    then other people could object to the objection, for example, by
    adding a statement that the objection is a logical fallacy. The
    system weighs all the pros and cons and displays the confidence in
    the proposal (and all the objections). I feel this is an example of
    a way to handle objections without voting.

    Mike&gt; Well, I think such objections would still be votes.

Ned&gt; Mike, :^) enough already with attempting to legislate that the rest 
of us use your own personal idiosyncratic definition for the term 
&quot;vote&quot;. What you are doing is forcing the rest of us to make up terms 
such as &quot;naked vote&quot; or &quot;pure vote&quot; or &quot;just a vote&quot; or &quot;counted vote&quot; 
or &quot;objection+vote&quot; to try to make the distinction between an objection 
(or more generally, a proposal) and &quot;just a vote&quot;.

    &quot;Communicative rationality&quot; is communication that is &quot;oriented to
    achieving, sustaining and reviewing consensus -- and indeed a
    consensus that rests on the inter subjective recognition of
    criticisable validity claims&quot;. A proposal constitutes such
    communication. A &quot;naked vote&quot; does not constitute such communication.

    A proposal submits itself to criticism and systematic examination
    through discourse. A proposal presents good reasons to implement the
    proposal, or at least promises that good reasons exist and could be
    requested. Even in the case that the proposal springs from a
    subjective preference, the subjective preference is publicly
    revealed, and may through discourse be counter-balanced, or balanced
    in relation to wider consequences.

    A &quot;naked vote&quot; responds to a proposal without itself being a
    proposal. It has no rational discourse clothes on. It expresses a
    preference without presenting or promising reasons for that
    preference. It does not submit itself to criticism and systematic
    examination. It cannot effectively be challenged through rational
    discourse, since it is but a raw, naked, inarticulate &quot;grunt&quot; of
    preference, that has its effect simply through being counted.

The distinction above exists. What terms do you suggest that we use when 
we talk about it (with you)? (If you suggest that we should use the 
terms &quot;proposal&quot; and &quot;vote&quot;, you win a pony ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; In form they'd be both objections *and* votes. Participants
    would then have to choose what content to put in them.

Ned&gt; In Bentley's passage to which you responded, he gave an example of 
a means through which an objection could be objected to: by pointing to 
its logical fallacy. A vote (using the standard definition of the term) 
cannot be objected to -- it has its effect through being counted, not 
through discourse. &quot;Choosing the content&quot; is precisely what opens the 
objection to challenge through discourse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; But those who naively used them to express reasons would be
    roundly defeated by those who instead used them to express votes and
    to force the decision one way or another.

Ned&gt; In this passage, you reveal that both your imagination and your 
experience have failed you. They have provided you with no examples of 
rational discourse actually working in the way that Habermas claims that 
it can.

What is it about &quot;oriented to achieving, sustaining and reviewing 
consensus -- and indeed a consensus that rests on the inter subjective 
recognition of criticisable validity claims&quot; that you do not understand?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; A system that was intended for reasoned argument would then
    break down into a system of brute force decision. Do you see what I
    mean?

Ned&gt; Decision making through rational discourse definitely does break 
down into brute force decision making whenever votes are cast and 
*counted* to yield the decision. (Here I am using the standard 
definition of the term &quot;vote&quot;, not yours. Your definition misleads you 
into thinking that &quot;votes&quot; can have this effect even when counting them 
plays no role in arriving at the decision.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; However we choose to define consensus, we want it to arise
    from the &quot;unforced force of the better argument&quot; (Habermas).

Ned&gt; I heartily agree!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; That won't be possible if we get it mixed up with decision
    systems, which are necessarily media of brute force.

Ned&gt; You have made a breathtaking claim here, regarding what is possible 
and not possible. I will be interested to read your arguments in support 
of that breathtaking claim.

Beyond that, here is a problem that you have:

You want there to be a system through which consensus is reached, but 
that does not make decisions. (To me this idea seems to be a bizarre 
oxymoron, but that's just me ...).

And then you want there to be another entirely separate system that 
makes decisions, which will (you say) be necessarily a medium of brute 
force (whatever that means).

This raises the question, what will induce the decision making system to 
pay any attention at all to the consensus-reaching system?

To the extent that there are reasons that the decision system will heed 
the consensus system, the consensus system has power over the decision 
system, which means that the consensus system is therefore in fact 
making decisions when it reaches consensus. That is your problem. The 
consensus system remains &quot;clean&quot; only to the extent that it has no 
effect whatsoever on the decisions of the decision system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; Why not drop the function of decision making entirely and fall
    back to rational discourse?

Ned&gt; So your view is that it would be better for public decisions to be 
made without there being any rational discourse involved? I suspect that 
most people would disagree (or at least I hope that they would).

Alternatively, you think that decision making and rational discourse are 
mutually exclusive activities, intrinsically. If that is your view, then 
I would be interested to read your arguments in support of that 
remarkably remarkable view.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; That's really all that's needed. The world has plenty of
    systems for forcing decisions on people, but few supports for
    reasoned discussion.

Ned&gt; All that is needed for what? Is reasoned discussion an end in 
itself? I would have thought that our aim was to design *decision* 
systems that would make better decisions than do the decision systems 
that we have now.

And another point: &quot;systems for forcing decisions on people&quot; are not the 
same things as &quot;systems for making decisions&quot;. Police systems and 
military systems and such are in the business of &quot;forcing decisions on 
people&quot;. Governance decision systems make decisions, which then serve to 
direct &quot;forcing&quot; actions. You appear to be conflating different sorts of 
systems, and making an analytical category error in your judgement of 
what the world needs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; And if we don't attempt to glue reasoned discussion (open and
    free) to decision making (centralized and forced), then we needn't
    jam everyone into the same discussion medium. Harry and friends can
    continue using Web forums, while Alex and friends continue using
    email, and so forth. No need to argue (as in the other thread) which
    is &quot;better&quot;.

Ned&gt; Here again you appear (to me) to be making a category error. In a 
direct democracy, when the &quot;reasoned discussion&quot; reaches its conclusion, 
that conclusion is the decision. The conclusion and the decision are one 
and the same thing. There is no separating them. If the 
conclusion/decision is then subsequently ignored by those charged with 
implementation, that is an instance of &quot;democracy not in action&quot; -- 
failure of democracy.

In the context of direct democracy, I don't understand what &quot;decision 
making (centralized and forced)&quot; could mean, or could be applied to. Are 
you suggesting that the Metagovernment community (as a direct democracy) 
should spend its time and talent in endless &quot;reasoned discussion (open 
and free)&quot; without ever at all producing any decisions?

If you want us to never make any decisions, then you are correct that it 
really doesn't matter which discussion mediums we use, and there is 
indeed no need to argue which is &quot;better&quot;, nor is there any substantive 
basis for such argument.
