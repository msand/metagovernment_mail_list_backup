<PRE>Hi Alex,

    Ned&gt; Once we have the money in hand, my proposal is that
    compensation for Metagovernance work be determined democratically,
    through proposing and agreeing/deciding.

    Alex&gt; I feel that there has to be a predictable mechanism which
    prevents dictatorship of majority. It should be about process and
    tasks and not about people. I'm not sure how to do it, but its
    important to put a lot of thought into this.

Alex, I could not agree more. YES!

And also, should I take your response as a &quot;yes&quot; to the proposal that 
(in principle) compensation for Metagovernance work be determined 
democratically?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; Do you know &quot;Scrum's Planning Poker&quot; or the &quot;Wideband Delphi
    Estimation Method&quot;? What do you think of this approach?

Scrum's planning poker can be useful in planning and prioritizing and 
such. But it seems to me that the best basis for determining 
COMPENSATION for people is measuring and appraising what has happened in 
the past (work accomplished). It would be better to base compensation on 
what has happened, not upon guesses about what may happen. For example, 
when predictions turn out to be bad, the compensation to the predictors 
should reflect that. Yes? (Maybe I am not understanding how you wish to 
apply scrum's poker to determining compensation?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; And last but probably not least, principal-agent-conflicts
    should be avoided, so people do not try assign points to tasks for
    other political reasons ...

Again, I could not agree more. These are the sorts of problems that our 
direct democratic decision system design must forestall and mitigate. 
Designing good systems is hard work.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Alex (and anyone else interested),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Metagovernance work is not like the work of growing zucchinis, or
</I>&gt;<i>     the work of writing code. The &quot;products&quot; of metagovernance work
</I>&gt;<i>     (proposals, and agreements/decisions concerning proposals) are not
</I>&gt;<i>     generally amenable to free market pricing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposals as such are not and if it were possible one shouldnt do it, 
</I>&gt;<i> because otherwise nobody would use them.
</I>&gt;<i> But a proposal is only a proposal and it will only come to life if 
</I>&gt;<i> there is software implementing the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     At this point, the Metagovernment entity has no national currency
</I>&gt;<i>     income to distribute, just as startups, generally, have no income
</I>&gt;<i>     at the outset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but that does not prevent metagovernment from creating its own 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;artificial currency&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment could make it transparent what it is that people work 
</I>&gt;<i> on and reward people for doing people, by adding points to their 
</I>&gt;<i> account. Those points could be &quot;shares&quot; and those shares could 
</I>&gt;<i> depreciate too. If there will be &quot;income&quot; at some point in time, those 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;points&quot; could be used to distribute it among those who have &quot;points&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Until we have an income (from donations, from individuals choosing
</I>&gt;<i>     to &quot;invest&quot; in a better future for the planet), we can do what
</I>&gt;<i>     startups often do. We can create our own &quot;stock-option green
</I>&gt;<i>     stamps&quot; out of thin air, and distribute them for work done, with
</I>&gt;<i>     the possibility that at some future time the green stamps can be
</I>&gt;<i>     traded in for &quot;real&quot; currencies (from the future donation income).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If we do this, it puts us immediately in the position of having
</I>&gt;<i>     money to handle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yeah ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> But if we do so, this will be challenging. There needs to be 
</I>&gt;<i> transparency and a machenism to assess the work that is done by 
</I>&gt;<i> people. &quot;Scrum's Planning Poker&quot; comes to mind:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEOd5G_p_1Y">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEOd5G_p_1Y</A>
</I>&gt;<i> (afaik a variation of the Wideband Delphi estimation method)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Once we have the money in hand, my proposal is that compensation
</I>&gt;<i>     for Metagovernance work be determined democratically, through
</I>&gt;<i>     proposing and agreeing/deciding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel that there has to be a predictable mechanism which prevents 
</I>&gt;<i> dictatorship of majority. It should be about process and tasks and not 
</I>&gt;<i> about people. I'm not sure how to do it, but its important to put a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot of thought into this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (I have written out detailed specifications for one way that this
</I>&gt;<i>     might be accomplished over on the wiser website. But in this
</I>&gt;<i>     thread, we are only considering whether or not, in principle, to
</I>&gt;<i>     determine compensation democratically. After we have agreed in
</I>&gt;<i>     principle, then we can get into deciding the details of how to do it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know &quot;Scrum's Planning Poker&quot; or the &quot;Wideband Delphi 
</I>&gt;<i> Estimation Method&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think of this approach? The average business day involves 
</I>&gt;<i> lots of tasks which are not easily measured and some of those tasks 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be measured at all, because during the time you would like to 
</I>&gt;<i> measure it, its not even clear that a specific tasks must be 
</I>&gt;<i> accomplished in order to fullfill some other task.
</I>&gt;<i> Such a mechanism should not prevent people from doing some work which 
</I>&gt;<i> is necessary, but not rewarded with points (so maybe the software 
</I>&gt;<i> should include an option to create new tasks on the fly and have them 
</I>&gt;<i> be estimated in &quot;points&quot;, or maybe there has to be a 
</I>&gt;<i> review/retrospective process) ....it may not be a beaurocratic 
</I>&gt;<i> nightmare too....
</I>&gt;<i> And last bot probably not least, principal-agent-conflicts should be 
</I>&gt;<i> avoided, so people do not try assign points to tasks for other 
</I>&gt;<i> political reasons...
