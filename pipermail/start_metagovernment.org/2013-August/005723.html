<PRE>I've started a new thread on this as I think it is different from the
conceptual discussion on consensus into a technology platform discussion.

 Alexander, please correct me if I misunderstood but I believe you are
suggesting that we should use email as the standard for most collaboration.

I disagree:

I was proposing a prototype which has no bearing on the final
technology platform. The criteria for choosing a prototype is ease of
development and flexibility because it would all be re-written for
production. To try and create an email service for a prototype would
increase the difficulty and reduce the speed of exploration.

I have developed email services before but I can not think of any way
this type of structure could be implemented completely in email. If
you would provide a description of what you want I will have a look to
see if I can do it.

I have not used listserv (or similar) software for years.

No one I now in real life uses listserve (or similar) software currently.

My son tells me that none of his peers use email anymore except when forced to.

My work is transitioning to online websites for most of the
collaboration. Email will always be used for some communication where
it serves best.

The majority of information and interaction for the people I know
(regardless of  technical aptitude) is on Facebook, Twitter, Blogs,
search engines, StackExchanges and services. They use email mostly for
one way communication from an organization or periodic two way
communication between small groups or individuals.

most applications today use email at some point and so would all my
proposed designs. Email has it's use and it's place but I disagree
that it should be the main collaboration method.

I do not see the value in limiting our exploration of a new path for
government to a single technology. Thousands of attempts will fail but
if one works then we have an improvement.

I would like to hear the opinions of the others on this list. Is
Alexander's opinion a majority?

How many people do you believe use a phpBB forum on a daily basis?
How many people use a forum AT ALL ... on a daily basis?

...now compare that to email ;-)

Its all about the mailinglist :-) And we try to*&gt;&gt;* manually structure the threads.*&gt;&gt;* The pirate party uses mailinglists too and submailinglists and they*&gt;&gt;* use whats called a &quot;sync forum&quot; to synchronize the mailinglist with a*&gt;&gt;* forum, so you could choose if you want to use the forum or the*&gt;&gt;* mailinglist.*&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;* I think it might be possible to improve this further.*&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;* @You proposal &amp; <A HREF="http://allangles.co">http://allangles.co</A> [1]*&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;* It's &quot;a nice idea&quot;, but the concept can be implemented in countless*&gt;&gt;* variants with countless different visualizations.

Suppose it would scale and so forth....*&gt;&gt;*  ... it's just nor where people are. In order to take off, people have*&gt;&gt;* to change their habits &quot;over night&quot; and not only ONE person, but many*&gt;&gt;* have to use this plattform and use it time after time, so they have to*&gt;&gt;* integrate it into their daily routine.... ...another tool in the*&gt;&gt;* endless lists of tools (and probably they have to &quot;sign up&quot; too)*&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;* It's not going to work. There's so many startups offering &quot;useful&quot;*&gt;&gt;* services and they try to avoid registration or allow it to use*&gt;&gt;* facebook or twitter or google or github authentification, so users*&gt;&gt;* dont have to do it twice.*&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;* What do people use? EMAIL... and email is even more widespread than*&gt;&gt;* facebook or twitter.*&gt;&gt;* Its at the heart of online communication and there's virtually nobody*&gt;&gt;* who uses the web that doesnt have an email account.

(I'm a little lost here)*&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;* I would prefer a system that has no voting at all. I have a prototype*&gt;&gt;* of a way to decide if a proposal should succeed that does not use*&gt;&gt;* voting. Instead of voting people add reasons for or against passage of*&gt;&gt;* the proposal. Each statement for or against can also be affected by*&gt;&gt;* statements for or against it in a hierarchy. An objection could be*&gt;&gt;* made against the proposal but then other people could object to the*&gt;&gt;* objection, for example, by adding a statement that the objection is*&gt;&gt;* a logical fallacy. The system weighs all the pros and cons and*&gt;&gt;* displays the confidence in the proposal (and all the objections). I*&gt;&gt;* feel this is an example of a way to handle objections without voting.*&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;* You can see an example at <A HREF="http://AllAngles.co/13">http://AllAngles.co/13</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://allangles.co/13">http://allangles.co/13</A>&gt; [2]*&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;* I look forward to seeing where the conversation goes.*&gt;&gt;**&gt;&gt;* Bentley Davis*&gt;&gt;* <A HREF="http://BentleyDavis.com">http://BentleyDavis.com</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://bentleydavis.com/">http://bentleydavis.com/</A>&gt; [3]*&gt;&gt;
