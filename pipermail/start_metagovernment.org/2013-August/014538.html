<PRE>Michael,
It is possible for someone to try and manipulate any system. These new
systems were specifically designed to mitigate abuses found in voting and
in unstructured discussion. Finding one possible abuse of a new design does
not outweigh all the other benefits especially when the other options
available today suffer from the same abuse.

You were very vague about how you expect us to go about &quot;rational
discourse&quot;. Please suggest a specific process or system or tool to
facilitate it so we can weigh everything out in the open? We are
theoretically using rational discourse right now but I see many
(unintentional) abuses in attempting to persuade people.

I do not see any inherent reason why decision assisting tools would
necessarily be &quot;media of brute force&quot;. A calculator that helps my family
agree on which house to buy is not brute force. A pro con list to help a
group see all the information without resorting to faulty memory is not
brute force. Do not assume that other people's systems will suffer from
your lack of imagination.

We were not arguing about whether it was better to use a forum or email. We
were debating if using anything other than email has any merit to try. It
was mostly an experiment in consensus building over a trivial subject. It
failed miserably but I learned a lot from it.


Ned,
Thanks for your encouragement. I have been distracted by the other posts
but I do want to get together and try out the current tools to see what we
can learn and bring back to this group (if they want it). The list you have
so far is great and it might be good to do a quick search for other
existing tools. .


Everyone,
Ned and I may be experimenting with existing tools to see what is out there
to assist in building consensus. It looks like others have done this in the
past so any suggested tools or systems would be appreciated. We also would
appreciate anyone that would like to join this journey.

On a different note, I am disappointed in the number of people trying to
persuade others not to try an experiment in favor of their own idea without
community intervention. Has this community chosen a tone of discouraging
experimentation and innovation?

Can't we try most of these experiments? I am available to use my skills to
prototype any idea that can be expressed specifically enough to be
implemented. So far a majority of the conversation has been spent saying
why a specific idea would not work. I feel it would be more effective to
actually try the ideas out instead of assuming we already know everything.

Frustratedly,

Bentley Davis

Bentley, Harry and Alex,

&gt;<i>* ... An objection could be made against the proposal but then other*&gt;* people could object to the objection, for example, by adding a*&gt;* statement that the objection is a logical fallacy. The system weighs*&gt;* all the pros and cons and displays the confidence in the proposal*&gt;* (and all the objections). I feel this is an example of a way to*&gt;* handle objections without voting.*
</I>Well, I think such objections would still be votes.  In form they'd be
both objections *and* votes.  Participants would then have to choose
what content to put in them.  But those who naively used them to
express reasons would be roundly defeated by those who instead used
them to express votes and to force the decision one way or another.
A system that was intended for reasoned argument would then break down
into a system of brute force decision.  Do you see what I mean?

However we choose to define consensus, we want it to arise from the
&quot;unforced force of the better argument&quot; (Habermas).  That won't be
possible if we get it mixed up with decision systems, which are
necessarily media of brute force.  Why not drop the function of
decision making entirely and fall back to rational discourse?  That's
really all that's needed.  The world has plenty of systems for forcing
decisions on people, but few supports for reasoned discussion.

And if we don't attempt to glue reasoned discussion (open and free) to
decision making (centralized and forced), then we needn't jam everyone
into the same discussion medium.  Harry and friends can continue using
Web forums, while Alex and friends continue using email, and so forth.
No need to argue (as in the other thread) which is &quot;better&quot;.
