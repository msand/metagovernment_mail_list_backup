Hi Alex (and anyone else interested),

Metagovernance work is not like the work of growing zucchinis, or the 
work of writing code. The &quot;products&quot; of metagovernance work (proposals, 
and agreements/decisions concerning proposals) are not generally 
amenable to free market pricing.

At this point, the Metagovernment entity has no national currency income 
to distribute, just as startups, generally, have no income at the outset.

Until we have an income (from donations, from individuals choosing to 
&quot;invest&quot; in a better future for the planet), we can do what startups 
often do. We can create our own &quot;stock-option green stamps&quot; out of thin 
air, and distribute them for work done, with the possibility that at 
some future time the green stamps can be traded in for &quot;real&quot; currencies 
(from the future donation income).

If we do this, it puts us immediately in the position of having money to 
handle.

Once we have the money in hand, my proposal is that compensation for 
Metagovernance work be determined democratically, through proposing and 
agreeing/deciding.

(I have written out detailed specifications for one way that this might 
be accomplished over on the wiser website. But in this thread, we are 
only considering whether or not, in principle, to determine compensation 
democratically. After we have agreed in principle, then we can get into 
deciding the details of how to do it.)
