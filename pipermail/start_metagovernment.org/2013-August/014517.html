<PRE>I agree with Gerry.
If you guys are trying to determine a means of communication for the long
haul. Http server side is the best method.
Most devices are going to a &quot;cloud&quot; system. Http seems to follow that
route.
I myself would try to utilize a p2p method where the files would be kept
and updated like a huge torrent file for the data storage. That way the
public always has access to the records and no real chance of fraud to
occur. And if the information was saved and backed up by many. The chance
of lost records would be slim.
But as far as long term I can see that this is like a spinoff of the united
states government you better stick to their preferred formats.
But one thing I don't understand about the name here with metagovernment.
Truthfully it should be changed to metagoverned.
To lead and govern one must be willing to take chances as we have learned
from our past.
And to govern is to control and manage. Not to be managed.
Just try to keep that in mind. And I do wish you guys luck with your
lemonade stand endeavor.
Maybee you will be a big people and step up to that global plate if you
want some respect. ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> I'm not going to do a point by point rebuttal of your response to Bentley,
</I>&gt;<i> but you are way off on just about every point. Email is an insecure and
</I>&gt;<i> dated platform, and I would not be surprised if it were completely
</I>&gt;<i> superceded in the next five to ten years. It is extremely relevant to look
</I>&gt;<i> to how young people interact with digital networks and the current thinking
</I>&gt;<i> is based in the rise of &quot;social media&quot;. Now, to some extent this is the
</I>&gt;<i> latest buzzword, but you also cannot deny the power of emerging platforms
</I>&gt;<i> of Facebook and Twitter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem that I see is that these platforms are branded products of
</I>&gt;<i> corporations competing to own these spaces. The new civic spaces need to be
</I>&gt;<i> free of this kind of domination, and that is the bigger issue that must be
</I>&gt;<i> faced in re-inventing government and finance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are right that any limited prototype is not likely to reach the levels
</I>&gt;<i> of participation to become self-sustaining spaces of collective work, but
</I>&gt;<i> there already are counter-examples to your claim. Wiki in general as well
</I>&gt;<i> as blogging platforms as a category are much more significant than email
</I>&gt;<i> and are the kind of non-branded social media that is essential. Take a look
</I>&gt;<i> at Wikipedia, many people use it daily and a smaller group collaboratively
</I>&gt;<i> produce it. Now, I would recommend Wagn over Wiki-media (the platform for
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia and many other community sites) because of the merit of the
</I>&gt;<i> design, though I can understand if you think I might be biased.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bringing critical mass to your project is a problem in social
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, not technical architecture. How is this meta-government
</I>&gt;<i> effort ever going to go beyond the small network who post here? Email lists
</I>&gt;<i> have much higher barriers to participation than interactive web-sites.
</I>&gt;<i> Email has its place (for now), but in the end it is just one of many
</I>&gt;<i> transport protocols. HTTP is much more powerful and flexible, and RESTful
</I>&gt;<i> APIs even more so.
