<PRE>Actually, what you say about email is said all the time, every couple of
years someone makes the statement, that &quot;email will be gone soon&quot;, but it
never happened.
And actually, with facebook, twitter and so many different apps,
messengers, and other services, email isnt necessary today, but it still
survives and, for example, we mainly communicate through email within
metagovernment. what do you suggest to use instead?

i use facebook a lot &quot;internet&quot; for me means 3 things.
1. facebook (branded)
2. google (branded)
3. check emails and respond (not branded)
...sometimes i use youtube too, but most of the time i go there through
facebook or google or email

see? isnt this a common pattern for many people?
email is the only wide spread medium that is not owned by a company.
why not start there?


&gt;<i> Wiki in general as well as blogging platforms as a category are much more
</I>&gt;<i> significant than email and are the kind of non-branded social media that
</I>is essential.

NO! Sorry, ... not in the slightest!
You will meet lots of people which have never used a blog or a wiki.
The only thing some people might have used a lot is &quot;wikipedia&quot;, but only
as an encyclopedia to look up things and NOT to actually participate in
creating that content.

But i guess theres very few, if any people, who use the internet, who
havent used email as well and do so an a daily or at least weekly basis.
No matter what you wanna do, it all starts with registering/signing up
somehwere, and without email thats just not possible.
What about government institutions, what about the corporate world? Do you
believe you can communicate in that world without email?
ever tried to apply for a job or contact someone without email? Do you
google for their facebook or linkedin profiles and write them a message?

email wont go away any time soon and i believe it even might NEVER go away,
but instead will stay as it is and used as is, until someone enhances the
way you use email, by enhancing email messangers (google mail) does that
already, but in principle anyone could do it.


&gt;<i> Email lists have much higher barriers to participation than interactive
</I>web-sites.

ehh.. no? :-)
actually everyone already uses email every day? :-) Whats an email list?
Its just an email adress you write emails to and receive emails from. So
whats difficult with &quot;email lists&quot;?
Dont understand what you were trying to say.

</I>&gt;<i> is based in the rise of &quot;social media&quot;. Now, to some extent this is the
</I>&gt;<i> latest buzzword, but you also cannot deny the power of emerging platforms
</I>&gt;<i> of Facebook and Twitter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem that I see is that these platforms are branded products of

</I>&gt;<i> free of this kind of domination, and that is the bigger issue that must be
</I>&gt;<i> faced in re-inventing government and finance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are right that any limited prototype is not likely to reach the levels
</I>&gt;<i> of participation to become self-sustaining spaces of collective work, but
</I>&gt;<i> there already are counter-examples to your claim. Wiki in general as well
</I>&gt;<i> as blogging platforms as a category are much more significant than email
</I>&gt;<i> and are the kind of non-branded social media that is essential. Take a look
</I>&gt;<i> at Wikipedia, many people use it daily and a smaller group collaboratively
</I>&gt;<i> produce it. Now, I would recommend Wagn over Wiki-media (the platform for
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia and many other community sites) because of the merit of the
</I>&gt;<i> design, though I can understand if you think I might be biased.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bringing critical mass to your project is a problem in social
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, not technical architecture. How is this meta-government
</I>&gt;<i> effort ever going to go beyond the small network who post here? Email lists
</I>&gt;<i> have much higher barriers to participation than interactive web-sites.
</I>&gt;<i> Email has its place (for now), but in the end it is just one of many
</I>&gt;<i> transport protocols. HTTP is much more powerful and flexible, and RESTful
</I>&gt;<i> APIs even more so.
