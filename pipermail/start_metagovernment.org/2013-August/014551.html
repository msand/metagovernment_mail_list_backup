<PRE>Hi Alex,

You asked:

&gt;<i> CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT? Whats it with the &quot;mailinglist&quot; that makes
</I>&gt;<i> it &quot;so special&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> Could it be, that its so easy to integrate in your daily routine to
</I>&gt;<i> check your emails?
</I>
Yes, it's that dumb easy to use - that's principle (A)!

&gt;<i> What else is it?
</I>
Beyond that the content is completely free of any context (where context 
equals more or less to structure and syntax) - that's principle (B).

&gt;<i> Is it possible to enhance email?
</I>
Could you be more precise on this, please?
What are your requirements to this enhancement - that's prerequisite (1)?

&gt;<i>From my point of view it's vital to keep the principles A and B intact, 
</I>otherwise you will lose the benefits of using email and therefore it would 
not be used any more!

&gt;<i> What would be the first step, one would have to take towards YOUR VISION,
</I>&gt;<i> if one had to start from where one is currently based (EMAIL). :-P
</I>
Probably you might implement a proxy between the user (currently reading 
this email) and the magic that happen somewhere on the internet.
To enable this, first you might define at least one feature of the magic 
that happen, see prerequisite (1), so that you can define an interface upon 
it.

Cheers
marc
