I agree the IRS has no priority for this group, but it is unavoidably important to an American NGO.

&gt;<i> what do we need money for anyway? whats all that 'ngo crap' anyway? and why would u want people to donate money?
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a plan what that money would be used for? (havent seen it)
</I>
Refer to my original proposal:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-July/005532.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-July/005532.html</A>
and I'm not suggesting that people donate money, but rather that the organization apply for grants from foundations.

&gt;<i> What would it help? Most of the work is thinking stuff through and implementing it.
</I>
The link above details the broad areas it would be used for. But more to the point, &quot;thinking stuff through and implementing it&quot; takes time. And for most people, time is equal to money. Right now for most of us, everything we do is little bits of effort we can cram into our spare time. With funding, we could work on metagov projects full-time. That could radically speed a lot of our work.

&gt;<i> Better to find a valid business model (maybe even bitcoin based?), so that donations are NOT NEEDED. the &quot;single responsible person principle&quot; in itself is part of the pyramid scheme.
</I>&gt;<i> Why would any single beeing be responsible for decisions that were made as a collective?!?!? Wouldnt that individual beeing want some kind of 'veto' rights to prevent decision to be made which might held it accountable?
</I>&gt;<i> The whole idea is flawed. You cannot have grass roots decision on how to spend money, but have an individual held accountable.
</I>
Maybe I am mischaracterizing it. I am no expert on American corporate law (which is why I am planning on hiring some advice). It may be more accurate to say that the IRS and the foundations want to know that the money would be spent responsibly and for the stated purpose. In other words, they don't want a &quot;charity&quot; to exist solely to buy luxury items for the officers of the group. And they want to see mechanisms in place to ensure that that doesn't happen: that there is accountability for the money being spent for charitable purposes.

I think I can build a structure that can give that assurance, and again, this will help other NGOs to model us and move themselves to a collaborative governance structure.

&gt;<i> Like i wrote in my other email, metagovernment has to think that issue through.
</I>&gt;<i> how to decide on the distribution of money and shares and responsibility? there's lots of questions unanswered.
</I>&gt;<i> democracy must start at peoples workplaces and thus, a democratic system with its subsystems must be capable of running a 150 person strong company and help several of these companies to manage their interrelated issues.
</I>
I'm proposing a real-world workplace which would run by these rules. I think it will serve your purposes very nicely.

But I also think that an alternative currency model, while a very intriguing idea, will be a very long-term project (which will take a lot of time and effort... translatable to money). This organization is something that can get launched in the near future.
