<PRE>Now we're talking design. My agenda is  this: add negative feedback loops
to the design of Money.

If you have a gripe with somebody you can tag that person. From that moment
on any 'coins' spent by this person will carry this tag. If your tag is 'I
hate this guy' nothing much will happen.

If your tag says 'criminal' you will be asked either to explain yourself or
risk being tagged yourself.

If I want to sell something my phone and the seller's phone will exchange
coins. My phone will scan each coin and reject based on a pre-configured
number of tags. If we need to exhange 500 coins and one coin is rejected
that person will need to have 501 coins to close the transaction.

This design - if ever accepted - would alter the work beyond recognition.

Empirical claims regarding money?
Your joking?
We are talking about earth where a few families own 90% of the wealth on
the planet.
They monopolize everything for starters.
Doctors ,contractors, financial institutions, manufacturing, all based on
money and control.
The list goes on and on.
Did you ever see how a chevy rusts?
Or how toyotas door handles fall off.
Or dodge transmissions go bad?
Its because of money. Cutting corners and saving costs on cheaper parts.
Plus they intentionally do it to increase sales so the vehicle just makes
it passed the warantee contract. Correct?
But if there were no money issues whatsoever wouldn't you just make them
the best you could .
Saving all of that energy having to constantly rebuild vehicles. Or even a
vehicle sharing system.
Its nice to have a big truck but you don't need one every day.  There's
many ideas that will work.
What about the accidents caused by people who couldn't afford to make their
vehicle safe on the road.
But money stops everything and everything in the court system is about
paying damages and financial responsibility.
When you get a fine for driving how does that help anything?
Other than cause undo stress on the individual.
Wouldn't it make sense to use a point system to where if you got too many
points you would just be required to attend driving classes or lose your
license.
Instead of someone who has money just pays and keeps on being an idiot
driver.
Do you know the stress human beings endure over the legal system?
With the resources we have we could build the space program and just keep
going with it. Instead of a competition it would be a shared challenge for
the world we would get the materials to make it happen.
We need to show we are mature and can focus on goals.
That's all we would have then is new goals for the human race.
Humans would achieve greatness by the measure of sweat and work they have
put into the community.
Everyone would just have the best education.
No money to want for the competition.
You would be bettering yourself on a constant basis.
If you had a vehicle, personal devices, clothes, nice shelter, and good
food what else would you want? If you wanted to be a leader then
participate more than others. Teach others and gain respect.
Humans with poor social skills can't just be rude because they have wealth.
So we would all be measured solely on the type of human being you were. Not
by what you had.
Now you see guys that have every tool possible in their garage but don't
know how to use any of them.
Wouldn't it be wiser to basically have public garages with all the
facilities that anyone could use?
Or have large free loaner facilities?
Don't even sell tools just make as many as we need.
Money would not impede progress.
We would grow at a massive rate.
There wouldn't be any issue of poor maintenance because of money issues.
If we need something we just put in a writ or request for materials. Think
of how many more inventions we would have.
We would all be busy building for a very long time.
The power companies make absolutely no sense.
Why have we not made the power a public owned system yet? Its because of
greed and control.
Wouldn't it just make sense to build and maintain power plants using the
best technology possible?
These new forms of money are just new flavors of slavery.
If money was worthless. It immedietly puts EVERYBODY on the same playing
field. Then the lower intelligent would find their place as well as the
highly intelligent if we all had access to the same opportunities.
There could be children capable of massive medical breakthroughs that never
were because of financial issues.
So money is holding us back.
Communism was deliberatly ran into the ground because there were leaders of
higher power.
Metagovernment is about power to the people right?
Think of opportunities you may have missed because of lack of money or
trying to gain more.
And there would be virtually no crime.
I know its hard to grasp.
Its the only way for no corruption.
We wouldn't need anyone of higher power.
Just random counsils of different levels of education for different needs.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Mark,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ultimately, you appear to be making a set of empirical claims regarding
</I>&gt;<i> money. As such, the claims are open to empirical (experimental) test, and
</I>&gt;<i> potentially to falsification. Yes? (If the claims are not testable and
</I>&gt;<i> potentially falsifiable, then they may fall into the category of
</I>&gt;<i> quasi-religious belief -- immune to reason and discourse. If so, then there
</I>&gt;<i> is nothing useful that can be said in response, and discussion would be a
</I>&gt;<i> waste of time and effort.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am open to the possibility that there may exist one or more scalable
</I>&gt;<i> social system designs (that do not feature money) that would work out
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;better&quot; than the various scalable social system designs that have been
</I>&gt;<i> implemented up to this point on planet earth (that have featured money).
</I>&gt;<i> Show me your design -- propose it. I would very much like to see it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Without having yet seen your design, and therefore speaking abstractly,
</I>&gt;<i> my view is that you are &quot;throwing the baby out with the bathwater&quot;. We use
</I>&gt;<i> money as a medium for transmitting energy, just as we use electricity as a
</I>&gt;<i> medium for transmitting energy. I do not see money as being inevitably a
</I>&gt;<i> root of enslavement and corruption, any more than I see electricity as
</I>&gt;<i> being inevitably a root of enslavement and corruption.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have written out a series of proposals concerning money here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a">http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps you can use my proposals as foils in articulating your
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding, competing proposals. And also, I will be interested to read
</I>&gt;<i> any direct responses to my &quot;money proposals&quot; that you may have.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with you that, in designing our new social system, we want the
</I>&gt;<i> design to forestall and mitigate corruption so far as possible, and to
</I>&gt;<i> eliminate slavery entirely. If you can show me a social system design that
</I>&gt;<i> does not feature money, and that can scale to the level of the global
</I>&gt;<i> population, and that accomplishes those design aims (no slavery, not much
</I>&gt;<i> corruption), you will definitely have my attention.
