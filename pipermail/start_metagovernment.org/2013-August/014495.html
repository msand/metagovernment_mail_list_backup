<PRE>Hi Ed,Harry,Paul, (Great Posts!)

First, for reference, here are the proposed bylaws being discussed:

    * *Bylaw #3: Participation: Through Proposing*

      Members participate in decision making exclusively through
      formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
      ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
      provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
      making.

    * *Bylaw #4: Decision Rule: No Unresolved Objections*

      The decision rule is that a proposal is cleared to be implemented
      at the point that it faces no unresolved objections. Objections
      are proposed. Objections are resolved through successive,
      recursive proposing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      RESOLVING OBJECTIONS

An immediate question that arises is: How may objections be resolved?

One way to resolve objections is to &quot;overwhelm&quot; them with votes, using a 
majority or super-majority version of the &quot;might makes right&quot; principle. 
This is currently the /status quo/ method used, globally.

My contention is that we can do better than this, in all cases. There 
are better ways to resolve objections, and it is worth our while to find 
and adopt those better ways, because using brute-force voting to 
&quot;resolve&quot; objections (particularly at the scale of large populations) 
has historically not produced sustainable social systems.

As an example, an objection that rests on some sort of identifiable 
logical fallacy (/ad hominem/ argument or whatever) can -- by prior 
agreement -- be considered to have been resolved at the point that an 
objection to the objection is proposed, that clearly reveals the logical 
fallacy. (The objector may still harbor the objection, but the objection 
will then no longer be able to hold back implementation of the original 
proposal.)

@Paul: An objection need not be a veto, depending on the methods 
available to resolve it. I agree with you that the veto system design is 
not good, because it enables blackmail and because it creates &quot;tyranny 
of the minority&quot;, just as you suggest. Two of the criteria that &quot;better&quot; 
methods must meet are that they do not enable either blackmail or tyranny.

But is the &quot;prior agreement&quot; regarding methods of resolving objections 
settled by voting? I propose no. For each individual, that prior 
agreement happens, first, at the point of joining the society. One must 
agree to the existing methods as a condition of being accepted as a 
member. Once accepted as a member, one is then free to propose new 
methods, to object to existing methods, and so on. Through successful 
proposals, the methods are free to continually evolve and elaborate.

As Ed has suggested, if the society starts out using voting as a method, 
voting would cease to be a method at the point that a proposal to 
eliminate voting as a method were to successfully pass.

In the beginning (now), there is nothing to prevent the existence of 
multiple societies, that use differing sets of methods for resolving 
objections. Over time, the &quot;better&quot; methods will prevail, through the 
greater progress made by the societies that use them. (Or not.) Our work 
is to come up with those &quot;better&quot; methods, in setting up our own 
society. Thus, the proposed bylaws.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      CONSENSUAL DEMOCRACY

Harry, there are potentially a huge number of relevant topics to discuss 
in the material to which you linked (and throughout your website). (I 
very much hope that we do discuss those topics.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Harry&gt; Essentially, in my view, it is impractical, in a democractic
    debate to aim for genuine consensus. (the complete absence of
    dissent) That is a recipe for decision making paralysis. 

Ned&gt; My impression is that we all agree with this.

In Bylaw #4, &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;complete 
absence of dissent&quot;. There may be any number of ways to resolve 
objections that will leave the objectors still dissenting. Decision by 
super-majority voting outcome is one example of such a method. Pointing 
to flaws in the logic of the proposal is another. Pointing to evidence 
against assertions of fact in the proposal is another.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Harry&gt; What is practical is to afford priveleged status to dissent
    and to insist that dissenting arguments are a) given full coverage
    and b) given full and proper answers, preferably to the satisfaction
    of the dissenter but at least to the satisfaction of the vast
    majority of those taking part in the debate. (my preferred
    &quot;majority&quot; is at least 80, preferably 90%) and only when a
    dissenting objection is agreed by that majority to have been
    satisfactorily answered, can the debated move on. 

Ned&gt; I do not agree that we should accord greater status to 
super-majorities or treat them in other ways more favorably than 
minorities or individuals. I do not find such favoritism to be acceptable.

I trust decision making through discourse more than I trust decision 
making through voting. (Sometimes discourse fails; my impression is that 
voting fails more often, and more seriously, from the perspective of 
survival of the species and such.)

My view is that even super-majorities should have to present their 
reasons through discourse, and those reasons should need to be able to 
survive criticism and systematic examination in order to become 
effective. When a super-majority finds itself &quot;satisfied&quot;, I want to be 
presented with an account of the basis for that satisfaction, and have 
opportunity to rebut. Otherwise we have &quot;tyranny of the super-majority&quot;, 
which is just another form of tyranny.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Harry&gt; ... the only way we can &quot;objectify&quot; subjective opinion is to
    measure it. The only fair way to treat the results of such
    measurement is to give them equal weight, regardless of how each
    opinion was arrived at. 

Ned&gt; Another way to &quot;objectify&quot; subjective opinion is to verbally 
express it, in discourse, and have it become an element of the 
discourse. Yes? If all participants in the discourse participate on 
equal footing, the process is fair. I don't see voting and counting 
votes as the only means, or the best means, through which 
objectification and detecting decisive resolution can be accomplished 
fairly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Side note: I like your flowchart, but I confess that I like mine 
better. If you find the project of interest and want to take the time, I 
would be very interested to read why you do not like mine better also, 
if you do not:

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      VOTING VERSUS PROPOSING

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; I'm not sure I see as clear of a distinction between voting and
    recursive proposing. Most Metagov projects are not about up/down
    votes, but rather using voting to help drive recursive proposing.

Ned&gt; When you say voting drives proposing, you seem to be distinguishing 
just fine: a vote is a vote, and a proposal is a proposal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; In the development of that Rules page I previously linked to,
    for example, Thomas and I came up with very similar proposals. One
    was a slight refinement of the other, and won out in the end. There
    were numerous proposals beforehand. The voting was to help everyone
    understand each person's stand on the status of proposals. When I
    shifted my vote to Thomas, we had unanimity.

Ned&gt; Casting a vote does indeed reveal the person's stand on the matter 
at hand. What casting a vote does not do is reveal the reasons for the 
person's stand. A proposal (that responds to another proposal) reveals 
both the stand and the reasons for the stand. This makes the 
proposal-in-response potentially much more useful than &quot;just a vote&quot; to 
others, and to the process of seeking synthesis and consensus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; (Others decided to simply delegate. This wasn't just an
    abstaining from decision-making. It was saying that they wanted to
    contribute to the quorum of participants, but they trusted others to
    spend more time and energy on the issue than themselves.)

Ned&gt; Another thing that the delegation accomplished was to make the 
decision-making power of some individuals more equal than the 
decision-making power of other individuals. Any arrangement that has 
this effect is fundamentally anti-democratic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; I do have an issue with requiring effective unanimity (no
    unresolved objections) as a definition of consensus. Look at the
    parallel thread on this list. Mark appears to be coming from a
    completely different angle than other recent participants on this
    list. Do you think you can raise any proposal he wouldn't object to?

Ned&gt; Actually, Mark is not the one objecting to my proposals. You are. :^)

Without meaning to put words in Mark's mouth, his objection to proposals 
on the basis that the proposers may be freemasons is a pretty good 
example of an objection that can be resolved (by pointing to its /ad 
hominem/ basis) without seeking or achieving &quot;effective unanimity&quot;.

Voting is one method through which objections can be resolved without 
achieving effective unanimity, but not the only such method by any 
means. We just need to reach agreement concerning which such methods we 
will recognize and utilize in our decision making process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; More broadly, my point was that a surprisingly large percentage
    of humans are sociopathic, and quite a lot more are insane in other
    ways. I don't want to disenfranchise them, but they certainly could
    stop any proposal for any (or no particular) reason.

Ned&gt; Only if we let them, by being so silly as to adopt a veto system. 
You appear to be claiming that voting (with a popularity decision rule 
of less than 96% or whatever) is the ONLY way that we can avoid having 
sociopaths run roughshod over us. Do you really think that?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; For society to function as a group, there has to be some cutoff
    where enough is enough. Such a rule will not result in perfection,
    but on the other hand, striving for perfection just isn't going to
    translate to success in the real world.

Ned&gt; At the scale of large populations, popular voting has not succeeded 
in the real world. Vote-powered democracies in the past have not 
endured, and those in the present day are tottering. I propose that we 
give proposing a try, as an alternative basis for democratic decision 
making. (I agree that perfection will not be the result, but I like the 
survival odds of the basis better.)

If we do use proposing rather than voting as the basis, the cutoffs will 
have to do with the content of proposals, not with the popularity of 
proposals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; Even more broadly, other people are genuine authoritarians. They
    are the one group I don't see having a major role in Metagov,
    because their philosophy is inherently contradictory to ours. I'm
    leery of allowing a single authoritarian to quash every single
    proposal anyone makes in this group.

Ned&gt; I agree that it would be a bad idea to set up a decision system in 
which a single authoritarian could quash every single proposal. Let's 
don't do that. (Are you suggesting that I was suggesting that?)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; Making a 100% decision-rule for large-scale governance might be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   quite impractical.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; If the measure of &quot;practical&quot; is taken to be social system 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sustainability, then naked voting (using any decision-rule) has 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> historically shown itself to be impractical: 50% and 80% and 100% 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decision-rules are all impractical, in the sense that they routinely 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> produce decisions that are not practical from the perspective of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sustainability.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Everybody agrees&quot; is not the same as &quot;nobody objects&quot;. Bylaws #3 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and #4 are not proposing that a 100% decision-rule be used. They are 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposing that we abandon voting (popularity) as the basis for 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> public decision making altogether, and switch to using proposing 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (discourse) as the basis for public decision making. When proposing 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is used as the basis, there is no popularity decision-rule.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; We landed on 80% as an &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; and a reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   standard for consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; There is nothing reasonable about super-majority rule. There is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> nothing reasonable about naked voting. Naked voting empowers the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> largest sufficiently large group to dictate to all individuals of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the society (overriding their autonomy), with that group power 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unrestrained by communicative rationality.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> An &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; is not consensus. &quot;Overwhelming&quot; is a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> power move, that is the opposite of reaching consensus, and that 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> truncates the process of reaching consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; But it can be changed by, well, 80% of the people deciding it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   should be changed.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I agree. At the point that 80% of any population has understood 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that naked voting too often produces not-good-enough decisions (from 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the perspective of humanity, nature, and future generations), there 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will be one last vote, on the proposal to abandon voting 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (popularity) and switch to proposing (discourse) as the basis for 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decision making.  :^)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; Concerning how votes/participation should be cast, I am leery of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   specifying one technique.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Here you appear to be talking about different kinds of naked 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> votes, and different techniques for casting naked votes, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> different algorithms for counting naked votes. But what the bylaws 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> propose is to not have any naked voting at all as a formal technique 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of decision making.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> To use a bad analogy, you want people to be free to use any swimming 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stroke they want, while I am proposing that we climb out of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> swimming pool. Once out of the pool, no one will be swimming, using 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any stroke. Decision making through successive recursive proposing 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is qualitatively different than decision making through naked voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; Different member groups do it differently. You may like your way
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   better, but they may not.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I do like my way better, and they do like their ways better. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Starting from that scattered state, if we can manage to work through 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> our differences and reach consensus, we will be more able to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> potentially make the world better (world peace, abundance for all, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> environment protected, greater personal and public autonomy, etc.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We can accomplish more if we work together. Diversity in decision 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> making methods is nice, but making good progress toward solving the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> world's biggest and most pressing problems would be even nicer. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> People are starving while we play in our separate sandboxes.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; The point of free-range voting is to allow people to participate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   in the way they are most comfortable, which should then be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   accommodating of whatever technique any system wants to use.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I fully understand that naked voting is the /status quo/, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that the burden of persuasion rests on those (such as myself) who 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> advocate moving away from the comfort of the /status quo/.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Casting a naked vote is easy and comfortable. Comparatively, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> engaging in discourse is hard, and often uncomfortable.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; What do you see as wrong with &quot;naked voting?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Great Question!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can produce better decisions more reliably than voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can produce those better decisions more efficiently than
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can provide greater public autonomy to each individual
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     than voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can protect the interests of absentee stakeholders more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     reliably than voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can diffuse power more reliably and appropriately than
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can be more transparent than voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   * Proposing can scale better than voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; In a well-crafted environment, isn't a naked vote really the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   same as proposing the same thing as what someone else has already
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   proposed?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Why would anyone want to propose again a proposal that has 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> already been proposed? Any particular proposal only needs to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposed once.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; Instead of re-proposing their exact text, one can just +1 it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The idea is to have each proposal pass or fail based on whether 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it can survive criticism and systematic examination through 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discourse. It is a bad idea to have each proposal pass or fail based 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> upon its popularity among people who spend six seconds reading the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> title and then decide whether to click the &quot;+1&quot; button.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Ed&gt; Could you view that as a translating technique between naked
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   voting and proposing?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; No. There is no translating technique between naked voting and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposing. The terms are defined as being exclusive alternatives, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> like &quot;swimming&quot; and &quot;walking&quot;. The contexts of the techniques 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> differ. The techniques themselves are qualitatively different.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Proposing happens within the context of discourse. Naked voting (by 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> definition) happens outside of the context of discourse. The vote 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> has its effect through being counted, not through being presented in 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discourse to others who may respond and challenge it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In this email exchange, you and I are engaging in discourse 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (each email a proposal). Discourse is hard work, and often not 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> comfortable. It can produce feelings of frustration, anger,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and surest path that we have available to reach full synthesis and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consensus. Making a decision through voting truncates traveling that

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     that reliably notifies each member of new proposals that may 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     interest, and that avoids inundating individuals with new
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     proposals not of interest. The details of the software and

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     In order for the decision system to be affordable and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reliable at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     the scale of the global population, it must have a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sub-system that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     efficiently and reliably applies all relevant past decisions to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     each new proposal that is submitted. (The past decisions 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> serve as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     filters; each new proposal must successfully &quot;pass through&quot; all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     such filters in order to be cleared for implementation.) The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     details of the software and practices that will together effect
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     this will be co-created and evolved through successive 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> successful
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     proposing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  7. *AMENDMENTS: THROUGH PROPOSING*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Additions and amendments to these bylaws may be effected 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     successfully proposing.
