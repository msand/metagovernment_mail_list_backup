<PRE> I am tempted to call for a vote or just ignore the competition to get
my way but since this issue came out of the consensus discussion I
would like to test out some of those theories. To start we should make
sure that Alexanders objections to my proposal of a web based
prototype are given full and complete consideration.

 Here is my attempt to summarize the pro/con points of the
conversation so far. the dashes show a hierarchy and the number is how
the statement is supported by it's children. A statement with no
children is assumed to be 100% supported.

Alexander, please correct me where I am wrong.

(17%)We should use Email as the main functionality of our application.
-(pro 50%)Modern email applications allow for advanced functionality
in the email.
--(con 100%)Almost all email readers limit HTML features, either for
security reasons, or because of the nature of the interface. CSS and
JavaScript can be especially problematic.
(<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-mail_clients">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-mail_clients</A>)
--(pro 100%)Indeed many email clients allow for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
-(pro 50%)Most people use email most of the time
--(pro 100%)Email is used significantly as a source of information and
communication
--(con 100%)92% people read their email online. 19% of the person's
time online is spent on emails. The other 4/5th of the time they are
using web applications (<A HREF="http://www.go-gulf.com/blog/online-time/">http://www.go-gulf.com/blog/online-time/</A>)
-(con 100%)Email can be used as a rich notification system using all
it's features without having to be used as the main interface for an
service.
-(con 100%)Email is a snapshot in time and does not always show the
latest information which can cause confusion.
-(con 100%)Email is not a trusted identity system. An moderately
technical person can spoof another person's email address.
-(con 100%)Many people turn off HTML email for security reasons
