<PRE>&gt;<i> I believe this kind of sturcutring breaks how people are used to write.
</I>


Someone makes a suggestion, the second persons coments and justificates its
&gt;<i> comments and eventually mashes it with a counter proposal. The next person
</I>&gt;<i> puts in some facts combined with questions and a meta suggestion, and so
</I>&gt;<i> forth....
</I>


I think you need &quot;buttons&quot; or &quot;autocomplete&quot; or other kind of interaction
&gt;<i> methods to get where you want to go without breaking peoples flow.
</I>

 There may be a confusion since Marc used the term 'post'.  Many systems
have a 'reply' button but it generally forces you to reply to a group of
statements and it all gets mashed together and some points get lost. The
system does not know which point(s) you are specifically interacting with.
It then can not present the interactions in the proper context so you are
not able to easily follow a thread on a specific point or justification. It
would be helpful to be able to reply to only a specific point or a group of
points in context. By asking people to separate their sentences into
distinct concepts and separate justifications a system could allow others
to comment on a specific point or justification more easily and visually.
You could possible still include multiple points and justification in a
single post. You could then still do all you outlined above with a smaller
change to the way people do it. We might allow people to highlight a set of
text and comment on that group. The challenge is how to visually represent
it in an understandable way.

I see the value in the proposed structure, but if you do not &quot;design&quot; the
&gt;<i> system in a way that gently picks people up, they wont use it, because it
</I>&gt;<i> needs to much discipline
</I>
I agree, Can you suggest specific solutions.
