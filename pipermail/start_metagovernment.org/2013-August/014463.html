</I>&gt;<i> Hi Alex (and anyone else interested),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernance work is not like the work of growing zucchinis, or the work
</I>&gt;<i> of writing code. The &quot;products&quot; of metagovernance work (proposals, and
</I>&gt;<i> agreements/decisions concerning proposals) are not generally amenable to
</I>&gt;<i> free market pricing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Proposals as such are not and if it were possible one shouldnt do it,
because otherwise nobody would use them.
But a proposal is only a proposal and it will only come to life if there is
software implementing the proposal.


At this point, the Metagovernment entity has no national currency income to
&gt;<i> distribute, just as startups, generally, have no income at the outset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, but that does not prevent metagovernment from creating its own
&quot;artificial currency&quot;.
Metagovernment could make it transparent what it is that people work on and
reward people for doing people, by adding points to their account. Those
points could be &quot;shares&quot; and those shares could depreciate too. If there
will be &quot;income&quot; at some point in time, those &quot;points&quot; could be used to
distribute it among those who have &quot;points&quot;.



Until we have an income (from donations, from individuals choosing to
&gt;<i> &quot;invest&quot; in a better future for the planet), we can do what startups often
</I>&gt;<i> do. We can create our own &quot;stock-option green stamps&quot; out of thin air, and
</I>&gt;<i> distribute them for work done, with the possibility that at some future
</I>&gt;<i> time the green stamps can be traded in for &quot;real&quot; currencies (from the
</I>&gt;<i> future donation income).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes :-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we do this, it puts us immediately in the position of having money to
</I>&gt;<i> handle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

yeah ;-)
But if we do so, this will be challenging. There needs to be transparency
and a machenism to assess the work that is done by people. &quot;Scrum's
Planning Poker&quot; comes to mind:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEOd5G_p_1Y">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEOd5G_p_1Y</A>
(afaik a variation of the Wideband Delphi estimation method)



Once we have the money in hand, my proposal is that compensation for
&gt;<i> Metagovernance work be determined democratically, through proposing and
</I>&gt;<i> agreeing/deciding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I feel that there has to be a predictable mechanism which prevents
dictatorship of majority. It should be about process and tasks and not
about people. I'm not sure how to do it, but its important to put a lot of
thought into this.



&gt;<i> (I have written out detailed specifications for one way that this might be
</I>&gt;<i> accomplished over on the wiser website. But in this thread, we are only
</I>&gt;<i> considering whether or not, in principle, to determine compensation
</I>&gt;<i> democratically. After we have agreed in principle, then we can get into
</I>&gt;<i> deciding the details of how to do it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Do you know &quot;Scrum's Planning Poker&quot; or the &quot;Wideband Delphi Estimation
Method&quot;?
What do you think of this approach? The average business day involves lots
of tasks which are not easily measured and some of those tasks cannot be
measured at all, because during the time you would like to measure it, its
not even clear that a specific tasks must be accomplished in order to
fullfill some other task.
Such a mechanism should not prevent people from doing some work which is
necessary, but not rewarded with points (so maybe the software should
include an option to create new tasks on the fly and have them be estimated
in &quot;points&quot;, or maybe there has to be a review/retrospective process)
....it may not be a beaurocratic nightmare too....
And last bot probably not least, principal-agent-conflicts should be
avoided, so people do not try assign points to tasks for other political
reasons...
