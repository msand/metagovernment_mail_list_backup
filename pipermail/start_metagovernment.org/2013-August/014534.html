<PRE>Hi Alex,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; We do discuss and propose on this mailing list.

Ned&gt; Yes. We do discuss and propose on this mailing list. But what we do 
not do much of on this mailing list is *DECIDE* -- and therein lies the 
problem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; If you implement what you have in mind, with email technology
    (html/css/javascript), then we could try out those new methods with
    &quot;real content&quot;, instead of you and bentley creating artificial
    discussions on truthmapping or whereever and think about what would
    work and what not.

Ned&gt; By &quot;what you have in mind&quot; do you mean Blinap? If not, please 
explain a little further what it is that you are referring to ... What 
do I have in mind?

Next, I am not sure that I follow the basis for your apparent claim that 
content which appears in emails is &quot;real content&quot;, but when some of that 
very content is moved to an AllAngles page, it becomes artificial 
content ...

Lastly, I confess that Bentley and I probably will spend time thinking 
about what would work and what not. Guilty as charged. (You are very 
much invited to join in, by the way -- I hope you do.) :^)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; Why not use a &quot;harder technology&quot; but as a plus, have real
    content to test your &quot;system design&quot;

Ned&gt; Again I find myself confused regarding the basis you are using to 
distinguish between real and artificial content. Could you clarify?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And also, I very much hope that you will hop over to the AllAngles page 
where the email issue is being considered, and put in your two cents. 
Here is the link again:

</I>&gt;<i>     Bentley, Greetings!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I very much concur with your preference that the prototype website
</I>&gt;<i>     not feature voting. (My impression is, that makes you and me a
</I>&gt;<i>     minority of 2 within the community, so we probably don't want to
</I>&gt;<i>     call for a vote on the issue ...) :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If you want to set a prototype site up and need a playmate, I'm
</I>&gt;<i>     there. Also, I am poised to begin playing on the TruthMapping.com
</I>&gt;<i>     site (setting up topics to debate), so we could spend some time
</I>&gt;<i>     playing over there some as well. And, we could play in standard
</I>&gt;<i>     wiki-pages, doing everything manually as we figure out in real
</I>&gt;<i>     time what we want to happen when and where, and writing out
</I>&gt;<i>     specifications as we do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     What you have just done in your most recent email, concisely
</I>&gt;<i>     laying out the arguments pro and con for using email as the
</I>&gt;<i>     development base, I take to be a tremendous service to the community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     To follow up on that excellent effort, one thing we might do in
</I>&gt;<i>     the course of our prototyping efforts (to give us &quot;grist for our
</I>&gt;<i>     mill&quot;) would be to &quot;mine&quot; past listserv emails to extract out the
</I>&gt;<i>     dozens (hundreds!) of issues in the past that have been raised,
</I>&gt;<i>     only to have the subsequent discourse fizzle out without the issue
</I>&gt;<i>     being settled. If we could extract and organize those, we could
</I>&gt;<i>     give them new life (they keep rising from the dead again and again
</I>&gt;<i>     anyway), and give them a fighting chance to actually be settled
</I>&gt;<i>     (through our new prototype system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Our stock-in-trade in this community is decision making. We can
</I>&gt;<i>     start by *successfully* making our own decisions on our own
</I>&gt;<i>     issues, as proof-of-concept demonstration to the world that we
</I>&gt;<i>     know what we are talking about when we offer the world our systems.

</I>&gt;<i>         How about a prototype website instead of using email or
</I>&gt;<i>         plugins. I think I could work something up quickly. Would
</I>&gt;<i>         someone put together a short requirement list like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             * A User can enter an issue
</I>&gt;<i>             * Users can create proposals to solve the issue
</I>&gt;<i>             * Users can create objections to the proposals
</I>&gt;<i>             * Objections are voted on? (I'm a little lost here)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I would prefer a system that has no voting at all. I have a
</I>&gt;<i>         prototype of a way to decide if a proposal should succeed that
</I>&gt;<i>         does not use voting. Instead of voting people add reasons for
</I>&gt;<i>         or against passage of the proposal. Each statement for or
</I>&gt;<i>         against can also be affected by statements for or against it
</I>&gt;<i>         in a hierarchy. An objection could be made against the
</I>&gt;<i>         proposal but then other people could object to the objection,
</I>&gt;<i>         for example, by adding a statement that the objection is a
</I>&gt;<i>         logical fallacy. The system weighs all the pros and cons and
</I>&gt;<i>         displays the confidence in the proposal (and all the
</I>&gt;<i>         objections). I feel this is an example of a way to handle
</I>&gt;<i>         objections without voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         You can see an example at <A HREF="http://AllAngles.co/13">http://AllAngles.co/13</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I look forward to seeing where the conversation goes.
