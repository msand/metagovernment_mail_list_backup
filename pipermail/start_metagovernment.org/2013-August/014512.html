How many people do you believe use a phpBB forum on a daily basis?
How many people use a forum AT ALL ... on a daily basis?

...now compare that to email ;-)

------------
I don't understand this objection. My forums notify me whenever there is 
a reply to a topic. (though, true, they don't notify me of new topics 
but I suspect that might be possible for someone who can tweak php more 
competently than I can)

In any case, on an active topic, the answer is &quot;anyone who is 
participating in the discussion will get notified when there is 
something to respond to&quot;

But that's not the main point. The main point is that some of us (me 
included) refuse to use html email because it is a threat vector and 
that means that even the basic formatting available in html isn't 
available to us. Moreover, there is no way I can organise or follow the 
lengthy threads I've watched floating through my inbox over the years 
(last time I looked it was over 5000 emails in a huge lump!) Let alone 
do useful things like search, cross link etc, all of which we can do in 
forum software...
