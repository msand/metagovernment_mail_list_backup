<PRE>Harry, Greetings! (I am a great admirer of your work -- I have drawn 
quotes from it ...) :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Harry&gt; Ned, yes, I prefer your flowchart in a programming sense.
    It's obviously more appropriate to the technical system design. But
    I thought even mine was possibly too complex for the punter to grok.
    Yours would have them frothing at the mouth and falling over
    backwards ;-) 

Ned&gt; Yes. It does. Routinely. :-(

And also, the differing &quot;complexity scores&quot; of the two flowcharts is not 
the only difference between them. Your flowchart features voting. Blinap 
does not feature voting. If you are up for it, we can launch another 
thread (or move to another venue entirely) to decide between us whether 
or not voting is necessary and (comparatively) useful in public decision 
making.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Harry&gt; The point I was trying to capture was merely that the debate
    doesn't conclude until all the pertinent issues have been properly
    debated and dissent has been explicitly dealt with in a manner that
    not even the most rabid dissenter could argue was unfair (even if
    they are then downvoted)

Ned&gt; I entirely agree with this, right up to the next-to-the-last word. 
For the last word, I would substitute in &quot;thwarted&quot; or &quot;foiled&quot; or some 
such. I disagree that voting should be used as the decisive method. My 
view is that there is nothing &quot;fair&quot; or reasonable about voting, and 
that using it as the decisive method basically makes any &quot;proper 
debates&quot; that may precede the vote into nothing but window-dressing. 
Professional politicians understand this; many e-democracy designers do 
not. :^)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Harry&gt; What this probably means is that we need a set of blueprints
    for technical design and another set for general consumption which
    illustrate the principles though not necessarily the nitty gritty
    detail.

Ned&gt; Yes -- absolutely. And in fact, there will need to be multiple 
versions of the general consumption material for different sorts of 
audiences.

But first, &quot;we&quot; (you, me, others interested) will need to decide both 
the principles and the nitty gritty detail. At this point, your 
flowchart and mine are not compatable, even in principle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Harry&gt; Alexander raised the issue of Scope and asked if participants
    are &quot;self selecting&quot;. I do address that question in much of my own
    efforts. The answer is &quot;Yes but&quot;. 

Ned&gt; This is a point where we really need better software to support 
discussion.

This particular thread started out as &quot;Society Bylaws&quot;. The target 
&quot;society&quot; was to be (initially) the Metagovernment community. The 
mission of the society was to be to direct the activities and choices of 
multiple national foundations (one or more in each nation), which would 
collect donations and then distribute those donations to software 
development projects and such.

So, we really need to &quot;fork&quot; the thread at this point. One tine of the 
fork will continue to define consensus and develop bylaws for the 
envisioned Metagovernment society, and another tine of the fork will 
work to define consensus for our future all-encompassing global 
democracy. There will potentially be a lot of feedback (in both 
directions) between the two tines, so our new software will need to 
enable that and make it convenient. (I will be dropping software 
specifications in just to put them on the table for our now happening 
discussion of changing software ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Harry&gt; What it implies for our discussions is that there needs to be
    a means of objecting to an individual's participation in the
    decision on the grounds that do not form part of the &quot;constituency&quot;;
    they have no legitimate interest. (eg an Italian has no business
    poking his nose into a discussion of French anti-littering laws; a
    catholic priest has no business trying to persuade a jewish woman
    not to have an abortion)

Ned&gt; (I really appreciate your ability to analyze issues!)

I see your suggestion as appropriate within the context of the 
&quot;popularity paradigm&quot; of public decision making. This is a kind of 
problem that arises when voting (popularity) is used to make decisions, 
and to frame the discussion of decision making. But when &quot;no unresolved 
objections&quot; is used as the event that pulls the decision trigger, this 
kind of problem does not exist in the way that it does in voting 
systems. The framing of the problem changes, which radically changes the 
domain of available best solutions.

But, that discussion (of your paragraph) needs its own separate thread 
(or other venue). It is one sub-topic within the more general &quot;defining 
consensus&quot; topic, which is in turn one sub-topic within the &quot;Society 
Bylaws&quot; (for the Metagovernment society) topic, which is in turn one 
sub-topic within the &quot;Global Democracy&quot; topic -- except that those 
various topics are not really hierarchically related; they are 
inter-related in all sorts of different ways. The new software needs to 
be able to handle that gracefully.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Harry&gt; I would also like to raise the issue (which I first raised
    many years ago!) of why the hell these discussions are still taking
    place in this medium (which is why I hardly ever contribute). Why
    aren't we debating this in a phpBB forum or similar, with all the
    proper tools at our disposal?

Ned&gt; I heartily concur: to me, the discussion venue issue really is one 
of the most important issues facing the Metagovernment community, and 
holding it back -- which is nothing if not ironic, given the aims and 
interests of the community.

And also, that discussion as well needs its own separate thread. Maybe 
we could resume the thread that you used years ago? :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Aside: Harry, there are other threads going on that are relevant to 
this one, and will be more. I hope, at least just for a bit, you will 
relax your &quot;thread magnet&quot; to let in more than just threads with 
&quot;consensus&quot; in the title. I really appreciate your joining in.)

(And also, if you would prefer instead that we move the growing tips of 
the relevant threads to a phpBB forum, I for one am wide open to that. I 
do not see &quot;raw head-count popularity&quot; as the appropriate measure of 
success for what we are doing. It seems to me that a much more 
appropriate measure is whether we as a community (and wanabe population) 
are routinely successful at generating high-quality proposals and making 
appropriate implementation decisions with respect to them. The number 
and rate of good decisions made is our appropriate bottom line measure, 
not the number of participants or spectators. (And, accumulating good 
decisions would be the appropriate attractor for deserved increase in 
popularity.) If moving to a phpBB might be expected to increase that 
measure (from its current nearly zero here on the listserv), we should 
move.)

</I>&gt;<i> efforts. The answer is &quot;Yes but&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example: a woman wants an abortion. Who is involved in that decision? 
</I>&gt;<i> My short answer is that there is a hierarchy of decisions. (for my 
</I>&gt;<i> long answer see <A HREF="http://www.fullmoon.nu/book/chap.php?id=c08">http://www.fullmoon.nu/book/chap.php?id=c08</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First there has to be an overarching social decision which sets the 
</I>&gt;<i> parameters for the acceptability (or otherwise) of abortion for 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone. That will be a &quot;community&quot; decision where some communities (eg 
</I>&gt;<i> catholics) will block it for all purposes with the possible exception 
</I>&gt;<i> of threat to the mother's life. Some will grant it for virtually any 
</I>&gt;<i> reason but only up to the point at which a foetus would be viable if 
</I>&gt;<i> born etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That community decision will also, usually, determine who needs to be 
</I>&gt;<i> involved in a specific case, doctors, social support, adoption 
</I>&gt;<i> agencies etc. So that sets the scene for the specific individual 
</I>&gt;<i> decision. But, from the &quot;scoping&quot; point of view, the crucial thing is 
</I>&gt;<i> that when determining the Principle, anyone who has even just an 
</I>&gt;<i> academic or religious interest can legitimately participate in the 
</I>&gt;<i> debate and vote because we're determining Society's ethical views on 
</I>&gt;<i> the permissibility or otherwise of a specific behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But when it comes down to a single specific case, the &quot;constituency&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> is reduced to a handful of &quot;voters&quot; and one of them, the pregnant 
</I>&gt;<i> woman, has both a super-vote AND a super-veto. Other participants have 
</I>&gt;<i> a minor vote and minor veto.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The woman can clearly refuse to have an abortion and no one can 
</I>&gt;<i> gain-say that; hence her super-veto. And she can insist on having an 
</I>&gt;<i> abortion regardless of anyone elses wishes - the super-vote. However, 
</I>&gt;<i> unless she intends to operate on herself, she has to attempt to get 
</I>&gt;<i> the co-operation (minor vote) of, at least, the medics in the case or 
</I>&gt;<i> else they can exercise their minor veto and refuse to carry out the 
</I>&gt;<i> abortion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More importantly, assuming we're in a community in which abortion is 
</I>&gt;<i> permitted in principle, then none of the opponents of that policy have 
</I>&gt;<i> ANY right to be involved in the specific case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the scope is determined by whether we're talking principles or 
</I>&gt;<i> specifics. Principle (is a behaviour permitted/prohibited) is a matter 
</I>&gt;<i> for the community - which is, presumably, already self selected 
</I>&gt;<i> geographically or constitutionally. Specifics are decided by those 
</I>&gt;<i> directly affected by or required to implement the decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What it implies for our discussions is that there needs to be a means 
</I>&gt;<i> of objecting to an individual's participation in the decision on the 
</I>&gt;<i> grounds that do not form part of the &quot;constituency&quot;; they have no 
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate interest. (eg an Italian has no business poking his nose 
</I>&gt;<i> into a discussion of French anti-littering laws; a catholic priest has 
</I>&gt;<i> no business trying to persuade a jewish woman not to have an abortion)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ************************
</I>&gt;<i> Ned raised the issue of &quot;too many issues&quot;, with which I agree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would also like to raise the issue (which I first raised many years 
</I>&gt;<i> ago!) of why the hell these discussions are still taking place in this
