<PRE>Yeah I'm going to have to say I'm out of the Metagovernment. Its just a
different flavor of what we have now. I cannot support this anymore.
We need to learn from our mistakes. You guys are hell bent on currency and
having people lead you around.
Sorry guys. It was a good idea. What's the purpose of trying to make this
if its just using your phone as a voting booth? Basically you took your
government and reduced it to an app. I was pushing this to my 2000 facebook
friends. But now I see its just another masonic government. :-(
I wish you guys would put down the goat penis and decide to do what's
right. Oh well. Good luck with your phone app.

&gt;<i> When people ask me what our group is, I often fumble: trying to boil down

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I realized I need to develop an &quot;elevator pitch&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch</A>&gt;.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> In case you're unfamiliar with the idea, it's the scenario where you're in
</I>&gt;<i> an elevator with someone and you have until the elevator reaches their stop
</I>&gt;<i> to convince them your idea is worthwhile. The elevator pitch is, by
</I>&gt;<i> necessity, going to gloss over a lot of detail. It's a sales pitch, and it
</I>&gt;<i> should be ~30 seconds long.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I've made a few drafts and come up with the following (which I think
</I>&gt;<i> still needs to be shorter). Let me know what you think, and/or how it could
</I>&gt;<i> be improved and/or what your elevator pitch is.

</I>&gt;<i> Every time we vote someone into power, we lose all control over the
</I>&gt;<i> decisions they make until the next time we get to vote. Metagovernment is a
</I>&gt;<i> global group of people creating internet tools that let you delegate your
</I>&gt;<i> vote to whomever you want, withdraw it whenever you want, or keep it for
</I>&gt;<i> yourself and vote directly on the issues that matter most to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By their nature, these tools don't work with a majority rule system.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, they use a sophisticated consensus model. Computers and internet
</I>&gt;<i> connectivity really help with that. The amazing thing is, when people are
</I>&gt;<i> forced to work together to create a solution that works for everyone...
</I>&gt;<i> they do! And these solutions are much stronger, better, and longer-lasting
</I>&gt;<i> than the decisions made by small groups of representatives who inevitably
</I>&gt;<i> make political compromises, if not purely selfish decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're not expecting our tools to take hold in national governments at
</I>&gt;<i> first. But voting for representatives happens in many different communities
</I>&gt;<i> we're involved in: social clubs, nonprofit organizations, homeowner
</I>&gt;<i> associations, community groups, school boards, and so on. We expect our
</I>&gt;<i> tools to take foot in the smallest communities, and expand from there as
</I>&gt;<i> people get used to the idea of taking control of -- and thus responsibility
</I>&gt;<i> for -- their democracies.
