<PRE>Thank you Ned.

What is the status of the hosting platform for Metagovernment ?

I found some references in the wiki but judging from the DNS records the whole thing is still hosted at A Small Orange.

I'm just trying to have an idea about the facilities that we have
available so that I can propose some technical solutions and think of a
migration plan.

Ping hostmaster ...

Daniel

Daniel, Greetings!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#160; &#160; Daniel&gt; First, I suggest we transition our discussions to a
&#160; &#160; forum-like platform.

Ned&gt; Yes. My impression is that you, Harry, and others that have all the 
appropriate expertise are in agreement about this. And I agree that 
trying to parse and otherwise play with emails is not worth the effort, 
particularly at the prototype stage. As you say: &quot;That way we can focus 
on the correctness of a reference implementation as a web platform and 
later start pushing features down other channels (email, mobile, voice, 
etc.).&quot; Exactly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#160; &#160; Daniel&gt; All of these things could be done separately but in our
&#160; &#160; case, I believe two conditions are necessary to actually set things
&#160; &#160; in motion :

&#160; &#160; - Build and contribute to something that is in *real use*. If we can
&#160; &#160; manage to eat our own dog food, not only will it taste sweeter for
&#160; &#160; those who produce it but I'm positive we'll have even more success
&#160; &#160; selling it.

&#160; &#160; - Build a free discussion and informal communication platform and
&#160; &#160; make it the foundation for any other system. Collaborative
&#160; &#160; governance ultimately is all about building a model for
&#160; &#160; transitioning from INFORMAL to FORMAL, be it ideas, statements,
&#160; &#160; arguments, decisions, action plans, etc. It all starts with an
&#160; &#160; informal discussion even at the highest levels of formalism (how
&#160; &#160; would you go about proposing a change in the constitution if not by
&#160; &#160; first expressing your thoughts with your own words in an informal
&#160; &#160; context ?).

Ned&gt; Yes. In my view, you nailed it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#160; &#160; Daniel&gt; Let me know what you think about all this and if we can
&#160; &#160; settle on a course of action, I can start working on a migration plan.

Ned&gt; The initial course of action that you have suggested seems good to 
me: set up a forum-like platform, move our discussions there, and have 
the forum send emails back to the list. Then, as topics emerge through 
informal discussion that are ready to be formalized and decided, their 
discussion moves to settings such as AllAngles, which are integrated 
parts of our evolving overall platform.

</I>&gt;<i> content, quotes, formatting, etc. is not an easy feat (I've been 
</I>&gt;<i> there). A solution that is much more affordable to start with would be 
</I>&gt;<i> to enhance the messages by embedding links for the various actions

</I>&gt;<i> correctness of a reference implementation as a web platform and later 
</I>&gt;<i> start pushing features down other channels (email, mobile, voice, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With almost no extra effort, the forum can at least allow us to create 
</I>&gt;<i> some structure by segmenting the conversations across categories and 
</I>&gt;<i> topics and by providing a threaded view in the web interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, well ... we'd have what I believe would be a minimally viable 
</I>&gt;<i> platform for experimentation. A platform that would actually be *in 
</I>&gt;<i> use* since our &quot;real&quot; discussions would be conducted on it. Through 
</I>&gt;<i> small increments and iterations, we can move towards a rich discourse 
</I>&gt;<i> / debate / collaborative reasoning platform :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Integration with a wiki / publishing platform
</I>&gt;<i> - Argumentation
</I>&gt;<i> - Decision formalization
</I>&gt;<i> - Integration with external e-gov tools and platforms
</I>&gt;<i> - Integration with a ticket-like system for the delegation of tasks
</I>&gt;<i> - Identity management (SSO, reward system, karma, membership 
</I>&gt;<i> certification - badges, privacy, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
