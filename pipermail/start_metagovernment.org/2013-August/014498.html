<PRE>Sorry, thats too vague.
I glanced over the flowplace website and in the FAQ it says, that money is
something issued by nations, but its not or its only part of what money is.

Really, i think i have realized a trend at metagovernment.
People think about meta systems all the time, like:
1. Create a meta money system, where people could create their own money.
2. Create a meta democracy system, where people could use their own voting
processes
... it will somehow guarantee that those projects are compatible to each
other.
... its &quot;astronautic architecture&quot; what is created here.

I do not think its a bad thing to think about such high-level
architectures, but when it comes to metagovernment, it can never be
implemented in a top down fashion, because that process in itself can never
work, because its thise process itself that has to change.


So how can you create &quot;astronautic architecture&quot; in a bottom-up fashion,
that means:
1. Start something people could use immediately + it creates value for them
2. Will &quot;naturally grow&quot; into the wanted &quot;astronautic architecture&quot;

Its more important to create a &quot;small pattern&quot; which brings value to the
people who use it and if enough people use it, it will unfold into the
&quot;astronautic architecture&quot;. It will start grass roots and virally spread
because its beneficial to all the people.

And if there is already someone who started such a thing, try to contact
him and join the process. <A HREF="https://payswarm.com/">https://payswarm.com/</A> (for example)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure that there is a lot of active work going on that is specific

</I>&gt;<i> as health is to healing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The core idea are that there would be openness and transparency throughout
</I>&gt;<i> the system, and we identified four domains of oppenness:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Open Rules (a language to declare the rules and processing of a
</I>&gt;<i> connected group of currencies for a community).  The idea is that there
</I>&gt;<i> would be a formal language that meta-currency engines could implement.  We
</I>&gt;<i> have been mostly ruby based, so we have been thinking in terms of ruby DSLs
</I>&gt;<i> (domain specific languages).
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Open Identity where we can largely build off of the open identity work
</I>&gt;<i> that has been done by others.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Open Transport -- mainly the principle that all participants in a
</I>&gt;<i> community of flows can access the raw flows according to standard
</I>&gt;<i> protocols.  Implementation of this would be largely using standard web
</I>&gt;<i> protocols (RESTful apis with XML/JSON data)
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Open Data -- goes more or less directly with 3 above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You ask great questions and those are exactly the ones that each
</I>&gt;<i> meta-currency community would have to answer for themselves.  The whole
</I>&gt;<i> point of this effort is that we expect there to be a discovery process
</I>&gt;<i> where each community has to define what is wealth for them and how to
</I>&gt;<i> measure it and make it visible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure that every community will want to build on a similar cycle
</I>&gt;<i> to the one at FlowPlace where cycles of wealth building declare and gather
</I>&gt;<i> around &quot;intentions&quot; and these intentions go through refinement in planning
</I>&gt;<i> and action phases, then they complete in reflection about what happened; an
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledgement of successes and failures and sharing gratitude and
</I>&gt;<i> celebration of what was completed.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how would the process of establishin such a currency look like?
