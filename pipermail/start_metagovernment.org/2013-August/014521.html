&gt;<i>  I am tempted to call for a vote or just ignore the competition to get my way but since this issue came out of the consensus discussion I would like to test out some of those theories. To start we should make sure that Alexanders objections to my proposal of a web based prototype are given full and complete consideration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Here is my attempt to summarize the pro/con points of the conversation so far. the dashes show a hierarchy and the number is how the statement is supported by it's children. A statement with no children is assumed to be 100% supported.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alexander, please correct me where I am wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I dont exactly understand what i am supposed to do, but i just comment
every sentence with a percentage value attached to it :-)


&gt;<i> (17%)We should use Email as the main functionality of our application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; I have no oppinion on that, but rather would support (100%):
</I> We DO use Email as the main functionality of our application.
(Where our current application is this discussion on the metagovernment
mailing list)

-(pro 50%)Modern email applications allow for advanced functionality
in the email.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; I guess they do.
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --(con 100%)Almost all email readers limit HTML features, either for security reasons, or because of the nature of the interface. CSS and JavaScript can be especially problematic. (<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-mail_clients">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-mail_clients</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>=&gt; true, thats what makes it a more challanging task, but it has to start
somewhere, thats why i suggested to ask people on this list which email
client they use. (i do use google mail)
Then watch out for the &quot;least common denominator&quot; on what those clients do
support.
And one could start with the most common email clients.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --(pro 100%)Indeed many email clients allow for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; thats an enabler. If they wouldnt, we could not do anything to improve
</I>it.


&gt;<i> -(pro 50%)Most people use email most of the time
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; I guess, and its one thing most people complain about, that answering
</I>emails takes a long time in their daily routine. ...enhancing email with
whats possible through html/javascript/css will actually create value if it
makes it easier to work through emails


&gt;<i> --(pro 100%)Email is used significantly as a source of information and communication
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; yes. there could be a world without facebook and without twitter, that
</I>would not break the economy, but if email were removed, people could not
get their passwords, couldnt register for new plattforms, couldnt
communicate in the business world, many technical services use email too,
...that would just break a lot, so thats why i believe email is significant.



&gt;<i> --(con 100%)92% people read their email online. 19% of the person's time online is spent on emails. The other 4/5th of the time they are using web applications (<A HREF="http://www.go-gulf.com/blog/online-time/">http://www.go-gulf.com/blog/online-time/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; Yes, thats what i was thinking. So 1/5 of total time spent online is
</I>EMAIL :-)
And the thing thats important to notice is... the other 4/5 might be spent
using web applications and other stuff, BUT: for most people, the web
applications they use are different, so i believe, beside facebook or
google, there might be no web apps, which are used by ALL people in a
similar frequency or duration.
How those 4/5 are put together is very different for each person, but 1/5
email is more or less true for everyone, which means, its a common
technology which ALL people use 1/5 of their time spent online. Thats a
huge advantage.



&gt;<i> -(con 100%)Email can be used as a rich notification system using all it's features without having to be used as the main interface for an service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; I do not believe it needs to be &quot;the main&quot; interface for a service, but
</I>i believe it should start with email (like twitter started with its
website) but now has an API and many &quot;twitter client apps&quot; too, which allow
more advanced usage.
&quot;Email Clients&quot; just should be the first interface and a basic one that
improves what we have now, without the need for people to install
additional software... they receive the functionality or app with the email
and its content :-)
If people start using those features (if WE start to use this features to
improve the efficiency of our metagovernment proposal/discussion process on
this mailing list), we could evaluate and improve on what people need,
while we discuss, because we use it while we discuss.
At some point, we could come up with an API too and enable others to create
&quot;stand alone clients&quot; which can communicate with the same plattform, but
not having to use email.





&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -(con 100%)Email is a snapshot in time and does not always show the latest information which can cause confusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; If email is enhanced by html/css/javascript, you could &quot;add&quot; what you
</I>say is missing :-)
The pirate party once in a while sends an email with statistics about usage
of the mailinglist.
Many mailing lists apply footers to all their emails by default, ...so why
wouldnt you be able to add some kind of &quot;dashboard&quot; or &quot;cockpit view&quot; to
all emails to provide the context that normal emails lack.



&gt;<i> -(con 100%)Email is not a trusted identity system. An moderately technical person can spoof another person's email address.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who cares :-) It has to start somewhere and if it really gains traction,
</I>those &quot;stand alone clients&quot; could be offered or gpg encryption or something
could be added to at least &quot;sign&quot; emails. This is a generic argument which
i do not find very helpful/constructive :-) Thats a problem which can be
solved somehow if it really becomes important in the future because people
really RELY on the results, but until we get there, its just not important.


-(con 100%)Many people turn off HTML email for security reasons
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Same argument. I do believe, that most people just DONT turn it off.
</I>The only people i know which turn it off are IT people itself, but most
people dont know that its possible to turn it off, nor do they know how to
turn it off, nor would they do it :-)
