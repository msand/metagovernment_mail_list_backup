<PRE>Hi Daniel,

What you write makes sense to me, but whether the extremely nit-picky folks
on the mailing list can ever decide on anything is questionable.  if they
do so decide, please look at my InterMix Voices of Humanity software as an
open source (at github with an AGPL license) forum/email system that is
quite sophisticated in its own way as a basis for your work - it is written
with Ruby on Rails, in case that makes it a non-starter for you.  Try
signing up at voh.steering.intermix.org if you would like to check it out.

atb,

&gt;<i> Hey folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Name's Daniel. Long time follower on this list though shamingly never
</I>&gt;<i> managed to get involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to propose a plan of action that could potentially cover the
</I>&gt;<i> issues that have surfaced lately regarding the mailing list, overall
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making and actually making progress.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, I suggest we transition our discussions to a forum-like platform.
</I>&gt;<i> The mailing list would remain active and posts on the forum would all be
</I>&gt;<i> published as individual messages on the ML. The handling of posts to the ML
</I>&gt;<i> is slightly more complicated and depends (initially at least) on the set of
</I>&gt;<i> modules that are available for the forum software. Parsing mail content
</I>&gt;<i> especially when trying to correlate with upstream messages and trying to
</I>&gt;<i> identify and extract user content, quotes, formatting, etc. is not an easy
</I>&gt;<i> feat (I've been there). A solution that is much more affordable to start
</I>&gt;<i> with would be to enhance the messages by embedding links for the various
</I>&gt;<i> actions (view details, reply, +1, etc.). That way we can focus on the
</I>&gt;<i> correctness of a reference implementation as a web platform and later start
</I>&gt;<i> pushing features down other channels (email, mobile, voice, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With almost no extra effort, the forum can at least allow us to create
</I>&gt;<i> some structure by segmenting the conversations across categories and topics
</I>&gt;<i> and by providing a threaded view in the web interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, well ... we'd have what I believe would be a minimally viable
</I>&gt;<i> platform for experimentation. A platform that would actually be *in use*
</I>&gt;<i> since our &quot;real&quot; discussions would be conducted on it. Through small
</I>&gt;<i> increments and iterations, we can move towards a rich discourse / debate /
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative reasoning platform :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Integration with a wiki / publishing platform
</I>&gt;<i> - Argumentation
</I>&gt;<i> - Decision formalization
</I>&gt;<i> - Integration with external e-gov tools and platforms
</I>&gt;<i> - Integration with a ticket-like system for the delegation of tasks
</I>&gt;<i> - Identity management (SSO, reward system, karma, membership certification
</I>&gt;<i> - badges, privacy, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of these things could be done separately but in our case, I believe
</I>&gt;<i> two conditions are necessary to actually set things in motion :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Build and contribute to something that is in *real use*. If we can
</I>&gt;<i> manage to eat our own dog food, not only will it taste sweeter for those
</I>&gt;<i> who produce it but I'm positive we'll have even more success selling it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Build a free discussion and informal communication platform and make it
</I>&gt;<i> the foundation for any other system. Collaborative governance ultimately is
</I>&gt;<i> all about building a model for transitioning from INFORMAL to FORMAL, be it
</I>&gt;<i> ideas, statements, arguments, decisions, action plans, etc. It all starts
</I>&gt;<i> with an informal discussion even at the highest levels of formalism (how
</I>&gt;<i> would you go about proposing a change in the constitution if not by first
</I>&gt;<i> expressing your thoughts with your own words in an informal context ?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know what you think about all this and if we can settle on a course
</I>&gt;<i> of action, I can start working on a migration plan.
</I>&gt;<i>
