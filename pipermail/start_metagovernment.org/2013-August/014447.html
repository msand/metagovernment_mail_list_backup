<PRE>Money is like language and art. It's a way to convey meaning over a
distance between steangers.

We shouldn't confuse Money with our current - and poorly designed -
national currencies or with the gold standard.

The question is: how should money be designed?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Mark,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, you appear to be making a set of empirical claims regarding money. As such, the claims are open to empirical (experimental) test, and potentially to falsification. Yes? (If the claims are not testable and potentially falsifiable, then they may fall into the category of quasi-religious belief -- immune to reason and discourse. If so, then there is nothing useful that can be said in response, and discussion would be a waste of time and effort.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am open to the possibility that there may exist one or more scalable social system designs (that do not feature money) that would work out &quot;better&quot; than the various scalable social system designs that have been implemented up to this point on planet earth (that have featured money). Show me your design -- propose it. I would very much like to see it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without having yet seen your design, and therefore speaking abstractly, my view is that you are &quot;throwing the baby out with the bathwater&quot;. We use money as a medium for transmitting energy, just as we use electricity as a medium for transmitting energy. I do not see money as being inevitably a root of enslavement and corruption, any more than I see electricity as being inevitably a root of enslavement and corruption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have written out a series of proposals concerning money here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a">http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you can use my proposals as foils in articulating your corresponding, competing proposals. And also, I will be interested to read any direct responses to my &quot;money proposals&quot; that you may have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with you that, in designing our new social system, we want the design to forestall and mitigate corruption so far as possible, and to eliminate slavery entirely. If you can show me a social system design that does not feature money, and that can scale to the level of the global population, and that accomplishes those design aims (no slavery, not much corruption), you will definitely have my attention.
