<PRE>Suppose you agree with me that we shouldn't crowd-vote the arguments.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-August/005749.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-August/005749.html</A>
How then can we formalize the &quot;unforced force of the better argument&quot;
and systematically discriminate it from the weaker arguments?

The human mediation in Ned's Blinap hints at a possible solution:
<A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/images/yEd/Decide.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/images/yEd/Decide.html</A>

It wasn't designed for this purpose, ofc.  The issue is a decision not
a continuous, tentative, fallibilist judgement, which is the reality
we want to support.  And it serializes the outcome through a temporal
sequence of objections, rather than standing the objections
simultaneously in space, as an argument map would.  But the idea of
semi-professional human mediation is there.

There's also my design for self-governing public mirrors.
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Public_mirror">http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Public_mirror</A>
The micro-decisions of a public mirror have nothing to do with the
weighing of arguments; so again, the design doesn't apply as is.  But
maybe it could be adapted?  Instead of harvesting threads from all the
world's discussion media and sites, imagine that it instead vacuums up
bits of argument (premises, facts, objections, etc); weighs them; and
fits them into a formal argument map.


           Tributary
             intake

   Tributary   |   Tributary   |
      intake   |   intake      | submitted argu-bits
               |               V
           \   |   /
            \  |  /
             \ | /

          Trunk intake

               |
               |      |
               |      | weighted argu-bits
               |      V
               |
               V

          Argument map
     

Now I can now participate in the formalized argument from whatever
discussion medium I prefer.  And I can participate informally without
any complicated software.  The &quot;argu-bit submitters&quot; and other intake
operators will take care of all the formalities.  I can concentrate on
the more important work of listening, thinking and talking.

Voting is still required by the weighers, ofc.  But the weighers will
be disinterested experts held accountable to the informal arguers
(like me) who elect them to office.  My electoral votes will now have
the desired effect of improving the overall quality and fidelity of
the argument map (of all argument maps) produced by the weighers.

And maybe I'll occaisionally submit argu-bits of my own to the intakes
too, because that'll be easy.

What do you think?  Or has this been attempted before?
