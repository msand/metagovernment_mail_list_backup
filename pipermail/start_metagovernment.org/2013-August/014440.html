<PRE>Hi Alex,

It seems that you have the makings for starting a startup: a &quot;founder 
team&quot; that offers the service of setting up other new startups in the 
manner you suggest. The success of those other startups that used your 
arrangements and practices would then provide validation of the 
arrangements and practices, at least from the perspective of each 
startup (though not necessarily from the perspective of society as a 
whole, or nature, or future generations).

I went through what you wrote and tried to pick out the problems that 
you are trying to solve. Here is what I came up with:

    * The richest keep becoming richer because they can sit back and let
      the structure work for them once they have invested.
    * To not let them sit back, there needs to be a &quot;social process&quot;
      within the startup of constantly evaluating results to measure
      progress.
    * Given such an internal process, it is then possible to arrange
      that shares can &quot;waste away&quot; if the shareholder is not continually
      doing work to help the startup.
    * This would in turn enable everyone in the startup to be a
      shareholder (creating and maintaining shareholdings through
      working), so that compensation would be in the form of a dividend
      paid to shares held, rather than in the form of wages or salaries.
    * In such a system, the richest (initial investors) would no longer
      have a free ride forever after the initial investment, which would
      be fairer, and would over time spread wealth away from the richest
      toward those who actually do the work.

Have I correctly understood the essence of what you are trying to 
accomplish?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Whats entrepreneurship all about, from an equity point of view?*
</I>&gt;<i> Leave customers and product aside, its all about creating equity for 
</I>&gt;<i> yourself and investors. Once you've it up and running, you might be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to lean back and let the structure work for you. Thats why 98 of 
</I>&gt;<i> 100 persons of the FORBES MAGAZINES &quot;Richest Persons Charts&quot; are 
</I>&gt;<i> entrepreneurs and probably many of them within the financial 
</I>&gt;<i> industrie, because they leverage the rules of money and equity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *STATUS QUO*
</I>&gt;<i> Whats a common practice or topic you have to get into when you become 
</I>&gt;<i> an entrepreneur and want to found a company? Its contract law and 
</I>&gt;<i> corporate law.
</I>&gt;<i> You pay wages, you get shares, and often there are &quot;founder teams&quot;, so 
</I>&gt;<i> they craft a company or partner agreement in which, amongst other 
</I>&gt;<i> things, document:
</I>&gt;<i> - who gets how many shares?
</I>&gt;<i> - how many shares do external investors get?
</I>&gt;<i> - how might be able to vote to which degree?
</I>&gt;<i> - if an investor/partner leaves, will he lose his shares? can they be 
</I>&gt;<i> bought back?
</I>&gt;<i> (think of facebook and the programer who helped zuckerberg in the 
</I>&gt;<i> early stages)
</I>&gt;<i> - do partners have to earn there shares? (so called VESTING)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...so essentially, there is a lot of custom rules or best practices, 
</I>&gt;<i> like (tag along, drag along 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag-along_right">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag-along_right</A>) ... which are just set 
</I>&gt;<i> up to make sure what happens to EQUITY at any point in time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *NOW WHAT?*
</I>&gt;<i> Something that i believe to be essential in order for an alternative 
</I>&gt;<i> approach to work, is a &quot;social process&quot; of constantly evaluating 
</I>&gt;<i> results to measure progress from day one and have a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> transpareceny (for example: in a startup)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> _3 Techniques which are already best practices in their domain_
</I>&gt;<i> *TECHNIQUE 1*
</I>&gt;<i> There is a method called &quot;Business Model Canvas&quot;, which is a 
</I>&gt;<i> top-down-view of a startup which you draw on a canvas with your team 
</I>&gt;<i> (could also be done digitally).
</I>&gt;<i> Then you attach hypotheses and their tests (todo's for the team) to 
</I>&gt;<i> every area of the company (partners, (activities+ressources), product, 
</I>&gt;<i> (channels, relations) customers) and work through them during the next 
</I>&gt;<i> week.
</I>&gt;<i> So you ITERATE through this process generating business model canvas 
</I>&gt;<i> after business model canvas, making progress visible, + it helps to 
</I>&gt;<i> not lose focus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *TECHNIQUE 2*
</I>&gt;<i> There is a methodology called &quot;agile management technique&quot; and one of 
</I>&gt;<i> them is called scrum. Most software developers should be familiar with 
</I>&gt;<i> it. Within scum, there is a technique called &quot;PLANNING POKER&quot; which is 
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of card game you run through before each 
</I>&gt;<i> 2-week-sprint-iteration (which means 2 weeks of doing work) to upfront 
</I>&gt;<i> try to estimate how many tasks you could accomplish from an 
</I>&gt;<i> priorityqueue of features/tasks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *TECHNIQUE 3*
</I>&gt;<i> Financial Bookkeeping and Depreciation. Where many &quot;accounts&quot; exists 
</I>&gt;<i> and you update them for each business transaction and you also 
</I>&gt;<i> calculate the depreciation over time, so you know your &quot;true costs&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> because you have to bear &quot;replacement investments&quot; in mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER*
</I>&gt;<i> Now if you use all those 3 techniques, you will eventually end up with 
</I>&gt;<i> a process, where a digital business model canvas can give 
</I>&gt;<i> transparencey to all participants about the current state of the 
</I>&gt;<i> company. Combined with the Planning Poker Approach, its possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> measure progress or do some kind of bookkeeping or point system, where 
</I>&gt;<i> you measure how much all your points are worth and after each 
</I>&gt;<i> iteration you could reevaluate in retrospective to what degree your 
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions became true and this practice will sharpen everyones 
</I>&gt;<i> ability to make such guesses (learning process).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now if you also account for depreciation (some todo's, like results of 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a customer interview&quot; or &quot;cleaning a room&quot; will depreciate faster 
</I>&gt;<i> than a bought &quot;office table&quot;), you could calculate an average rate of 
</I>&gt;<i> depreciation with which earned points waste away.
</I>&gt;<i> Then there is also those points who have to be &quot;written off&quot; after you 
</I>&gt;<i> did some kind of work which turned out to be a waste of time.... 
</I>&gt;<i> ...but the process of this is weaved into the CORE TECHNIQUE (with 
</I>&gt;<i> business model canvas) around which you build everything else and 
</I>&gt;<i> which helps you to keep focus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *What does it mean? And how is this related to the &quot;STATUS QUO&quot;?*
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Now, what if i buy an office chair and give it &quot;points&quot; during a 
</I>&gt;<i> weekly planning poker session? The &quot;office chair&quot; also has a value in 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot;. If many companies will do this approach, you 
</I>&gt;<i> essentially get an &quot;exchange rate&quot; between your companies internal 
</I>&gt;<i> point system and &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot; and the like.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What if this process works well, why not make these points REAL 
</I>&gt;<i> SHARES? And if you do so, why not make everyones SHARES waste away 
</I>&gt;<i> with the average rate of depreciation, so that people have to 
</I>&gt;<i> re-invest, in order to not lose all their shares over time? (=&gt; This 
</I>&gt;<i> will essentially make all this equity agreements or &quot;VESTING&quot; rules 
</I>&gt;<i> kind of superfluous, because if someone decides to quit and doesnt 
</I>&gt;<i> want to sell his shares, they will waste away over time)
</I>&gt;<i> Why should I invest work in earning shares if they waste away???
</I>&gt;<i> Because as long as you have shares, they decide on a potentially &quot;real 
</I>&gt;<i> time basis&quot; how much of the companies revenue (in USD or EUR or the 
</I>&gt;<i> like...) goes into your pocket. So you dont work for a wage, but for 
</I>&gt;<i> those points which eventually are shares and which will decide your 
</I>&gt;<i> monetary income flow (potentially minutely dividends)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IF this techniques, which in practice should make the average person 
</I>&gt;<i> better off, becomes mainstream practice (which is totally possible, 
</I>&gt;<i> because if there are role models who work this way successfully, it 
</I>&gt;<i> will spread virally, because it will mean more money and more power 
</I>&gt;<i> with less work for everyone beside the top 1%, but it has to start 
</I>&gt;<i> bottom-up and success of practicioners will automatically spread it 
</I>&gt;<i> and make it a mainstream practice.
</I>&gt;<i> ... THEN: shareholders will lose equity over time to those who are 
</I>&gt;<i> actively doing the work, which makes the rules fair again. And because 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone or every company will create their &quot;point system&quot; which will 
</I>&gt;<i> end up having an exchange rate in EUR/USD, they all get used to this 
</I>&gt;<i> and it will or might lay a foundation to tackle the monetary system as 
</I>&gt;<i> such, but for now, this is totally of reach.

</I>&gt;<i>         Do you know the forbes magazine and their listing of the 100

</I>&gt;<i>         The other way would be to get into the financial industrie and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         In essence it eneables you to live of of other peoples work to

</I>&gt;<i>         also the reason for the financial crisis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I believe money is an issue that cannot be tackled right now
</I>&gt;<i>         and have a couple of arguments why i think that to be true
