So, why not start with email?
Is it possible to create emails (emails might be able to use 
html/css/javascript?) or email clients which add some kind of functionality 
to the email itself, so that it could be used to automate the process of 
giving structure to the discussion.
Why not use this issue as a starting point to crystallize concepts and 
thoughts into usable software? It has to start somewhere and that somehwere 
has to be a &quot;place&quot; that people use, so that they can use an alternative 
route next time they are in that &quot;place&quot; :-)

@Ned
The manual process you are proposing can eventually be put into software, 
right?
needs some technical research and then we could try :-)

@All
What kind of email messenger do you use? gmail? outlook? thunderbird? 
others?
...so maybe a browserplugin or email messenger might be viable additions to 
support a process that brings structure to discussion and proposing?

Ned, yes, I prefer your flowchart in a programming sense. It's obviously 
more appropriate to the technical system design. But I thought even mine was 
possibly too complex for the punter to grok. Yours would have them frothing 
at the mouth and falling over backwards ;-)

The point I was trying to capture was merely that the debate doesn't 
conclude until all the pertinent issues have been properly debated and 
dissent has been explicitly dealt with in a manner that not even the most 
rabid dissenter could argue was unfair (even if they are then downvoted)

What this probably means is that we need a set of blueprints for technical 
design and another set for general consumption which illustrate the 
principles though not necessarily the nitty gritty detail.

Alexander raised the issue of Scope and asked if participants are &quot;self 
selecting&quot;. I do address that question in much of my own efforts. The answer 
is &quot;Yes but&quot;.

Example: a woman wants an abortion. Who is involved in that decision? My 
short answer is that there is a hierarchy of decisions. (for my long answer 
see <A HREF="http://www.fullmoon.nu/book/chap.php?id=c08">http://www.fullmoon.nu/book/chap.php?id=c08</A>)

First there has to be an overarching social decision which sets the 
parameters for the acceptability (or otherwise) of abortion for anyone. That 
will be a &quot;community&quot; decision where some communities (eg catholics) will 
block it for all purposes with the possible exception of threat to the 
mother's life. Some will grant it for virtually any reason but only up to 
the point at which a foetus would be viable if born etc.

That community decision will also, usually, determine who needs to be 
involved in a specific case, doctors, social support, adoption agencies etc. 
So that sets the scene for the specific individual decision. But, from the 
&quot;scoping&quot; point of view, the crucial thing is that when determining the 
Principle, anyone who has even just an academic or religious interest can 
legitimately participate in the debate and vote because we're determining 
Society's ethical views on the permissibility or otherwise of a specific 
behaviour.

But when it comes down to a single specific case, the &quot;constituency&quot; is 
reduced to a handful of &quot;voters&quot; and one of them, the pregnant woman, has 
both a super-vote AND a super-veto. Other participants have a minor vote and 
minor veto.

The woman can clearly refuse to have an abortion and no one can gain-say 
that; hence her super-veto. And she can insist on having an abortion 
regardless of anyone elses wishes - the super-vote. However, unless she 
intends to operate on herself, she has to attempt to get the co-operation 
(minor vote) of, at least, the medics in the case or else they can exercise 
their minor veto and refuse to carry out the abortion.

More importantly, assuming we're in a community in which abortion is 
permitted in principle, then none of the opponents of that policy have ANY 
right to be involved in the specific case.

So the scope is determined by whether we're talking principles or specifics. 
Principle (is a behaviour permitted/prohibited) is a matter for the 
community - which is, presumably, already self selected geographically or 
constitutionally. Specifics are decided by those directly affected by or 
required to implement the decision.

What it implies for our discussions is that there needs to be a means of 
objecting to an individual's participation in the decision on the grounds 
that do not form part of the &quot;constituency&quot;; they have no legitimate 
interest. (eg an Italian has no business poking his nose into a discussion 
of French anti-littering laws; a catholic priest has no business trying to 
persuade a jewish woman not to have an abortion)

************************
Ned raised the issue of &quot;too many issues&quot;, with which I agree.

I would also like to raise the issue (which I first raised many years ago!) 
of why the hell these discussions are still taking place in this medium 
(which is why I hardly ever contribute). Why aren't we debating this in a 
phpBB forum or similar, with all the proper tools at our disposal?
