<PRE>I have been quite busy for the last week and come back to the list facing a wall of text. A situation which very clearly points to some of the arguments being put forward in the various threads here (ones I have only able been able to skim.

My experience is that:

1. It is extremely difficult to follow all of the thoughts here, because:
 a. They are disorganized due to the format of email
 b. They are disorganized due to various ways people respond in email
 c. The sheer volume and weight makes it difficult to slog through
2. If these posts hasn't been in my email inbox, I would not have even bothered to try following them.

I am not proposing anything there; just pointing out what I think others have piecemeal said in these various threads: email is great and awful.

I am having difficulty determining what the outcome is from this, however. It seems to me that (and did someone propose this along the way?) a workable strategy would be to have a discussion map which follows along the emails, providing a way for the uninitiated to orient themselves to the conversation.

P.S. If <A HREF="http://allangles.co/Demo.html?id=14">http://allangles.co/Demo.html?id=14</A> is supposed to be helping, I am getting nothing on that page.
