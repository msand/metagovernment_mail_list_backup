<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-August/005657.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-August/005657.html</A>

Hi Mark,

Ultimately, you appear to be making a set of empirical claims regarding 
money. As such, the claims are open to empirical (experimental) test, 
and potentially to falsification. Yes? (If the claims are not testable 
and potentially falsifiable, then they may fall into the category of 
quasi-religious belief -- immune to reason and discourse. If so, then 
there is nothing useful that can be said in response, and discussion 
would be a waste of time and effort.)

I am open to the possibility that there may exist one or more scalable 
social system designs (that do not feature money) that would work out 
&quot;better&quot; than the various scalable social system designs that have been 
implemented up to this point on planet earth (that have featured money). 
Show me your design -- propose it. I would very much like to see it.

Without having yet seen your design, and therefore speaking abstractly, 
my view is that you are &quot;throwing the baby out with the bathwater&quot;. We 
use money as a medium for transmitting energy, just as we use 
electricity as a medium for transmitting energy. I do not see money as 
being inevitably a root of enslavement and corruption, any more than I 
see electricity as being inevitably a root of enslavement and corruption.

I have written out a series of proposals concerning money here:
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a">http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a</A>

Perhaps you can use my proposals as foils in articulating your 
corresponding, competing proposals. And also, I will be interested to 
read any direct responses to my &quot;money proposals&quot; that you may have.

I agree with you that, in designing our new social system, we want the 
design to forestall and mitigate corruption so far as possible, and to 
eliminate slavery entirely. If you can show me a social system design 
that does not feature money, and that can scale to the level of the 
global population, and that accomplishes those design aims (no slavery, 
not much corruption), you will definitely have my attention.
