<PRE>If you decide to go with email. How hard would it be to make a specific
pop3 app for our phones. For those that wanted such. I honestly feel some
form of visual gui specific to MG because phsyocologicaly . Humans have to
see something for it to be real to them. Another thing should he
considered. I know off topic but a format for identification purposes. If
you wish to start bringing people together on this they need something to
make them feel permanent . Its a human characteristic . I do agree to those
that think a change should be made. But I also agree with those who wish it
could stay. What about cross platforming? I'm not sure on the specifics but
if we can relay voicemails to a text. I'm sure its not that hard. We need
to start using the metagovernment app then a vote could occur and this
would be decided already.

</I>&gt;<i> 3. check emails and respond (not branded)
</I>&gt;<i> ...sometimes i use youtube too, but most of the time i go there through

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> see? isnt this a common pattern for many people?
</I>&gt;<i> email is the only wide spread medium that is not owned by a company.
</I>&gt;<i> why not start there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wiki in general as well as blogging platforms as a category are much more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; significant than email and are the kind of non-branded social media that
</I>&gt;<i> is essential.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NO! Sorry, ... not in the slightest!
</I>&gt;<i> You will meet lots of people which have never used a blog or a wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing some people might have used a lot is &quot;wikipedia&quot;, but only
</I>&gt;<i> as an encyclopedia to look up things and NOT to actually participate in
</I>&gt;<i> creating that content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But i guess theres very few, if any people, who use the internet, who
</I>&gt;<i> havent used email as well and do so an a daily or at least weekly basis.
</I>&gt;<i> No matter what you wanna do, it all starts with registering/signing up
</I>&gt;<i> somehwere, and without email thats just not possible.
</I>&gt;<i> What about government institutions, what about the corporate world? Do you
</I>&gt;<i> believe you can communicate in that world without email?
</I>&gt;<i> ever tried to apply for a job or contact someone without email? Do you
</I>&gt;<i> google for their facebook or linkedin profiles and write them a message?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> email wont go away any time soon and i believe it even might NEVER go
</I>&gt;<i> away, but instead will stay as it is and used as is, until someone enhances
</I>&gt;<i> the way you use email, by enhancing email messangers (google mail) does
</I>&gt;<i> that already, but in principle anyone could do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Email lists have much higher barriers to participation than interactive
</I>&gt;<i> web-sites.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ehh.. no? :-)
</I>&gt;<i> actually everyone already uses email every day? :-) Whats an email list?
</I>&gt;<i> Its just an email adress you write emails to and receive emails from. So
</I>&gt;<i> whats difficult with &quot;email lists&quot;?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not going to do a point by point rebuttal of your response to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bentley, but you are way off on just about every point. Email is an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> insecure and dated platform, and I would not be surprised if it were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely superceded in the next five to ten years. It is extremely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relevant to look to how young people interact with digital networks and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current thinking is based in the rise of &quot;social media&quot;. Now, to some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extent this is the latest buzzword, but you also cannot deny the power of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emerging platforms of Facebook and Twitter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem that I see is that these platforms are branded products of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corporations competing to own these spaces. The new civic spaces need to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> free of this kind of domination, and that is the bigger issue that must be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> faced in re-inventing government and finance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You are right that any limited prototype is not likely to reach the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> levels of participation to become self-sustaining spaces of collective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work, but there already are counter-examples to your claim. Wiki in general
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well as blogging platforms as a category are much more significant than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> email and are the kind of non-branded social media that is essential. Take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a look at Wikipedia, many people use it daily and a smaller group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaboratively produce it. Now, I would recommend Wagn over Wiki-media
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (the platform for Wikipedia and many other community sites) because of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> merit of the design, though I can understand if you think I might be biased.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bringing critical mass to your project is a problem in social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> architecture, not technical architecture. How is this meta-government
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effort ever going to go beyond the small network who post here? Email lists
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have much higher barriers to participation than interactive web-sites.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Email has its place (for now), but in the end it is just one of many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transport protocols. HTTP is much more powerful and flexible, and RESTful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> APIs even more so.
