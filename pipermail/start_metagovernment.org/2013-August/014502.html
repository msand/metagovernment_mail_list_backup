<PRE>Ned, yes, I prefer your flowchart in a programming sense. It's obviously 
more appropriate to the technical system design. But I thought even mine 
was possibly too complex for the punter to grok. Yours would have them 
frothing at the mouth and falling over backwards ;-)

The point I was trying to capture was merely that the debate doesn't 
conclude until all the pertinent issues have been properly debated and 
dissent has been explicitly dealt with in a manner that not even the 
most rabid dissenter could argue was unfair (even if they are then 
downvoted)

What this probably means is that we need a set of blueprints for 
technical design and another set for general consumption which 
illustrate the principles though not necessarily the nitty gritty 
detail.

Alexander raised the issue of Scope and asked if participants are &quot;self 
selecting&quot;. I do address that question in much of my own efforts. The 
answer is &quot;Yes but&quot;.

Example: a woman wants an abortion. Who is involved in that decision? My 
short answer is that there is a hierarchy of decisions. (for my long 
answer see <A HREF="http://www.fullmoon.nu/book/chap.php?id=c08">http://www.fullmoon.nu/book/chap.php?id=c08</A>)

First there has to be an overarching social decision which sets the 
parameters for the acceptability (or otherwise) of abortion for anyone. 
That will be a &quot;community&quot; decision where some communities (eg 
catholics) will block it for all purposes with the possible exception of 
threat to the mother's life. Some will grant it for virtually any reason 
but only up to the point at which a foetus would be viable if born etc.

That community decision will also, usually, determine who needs to be 
involved in a specific case, doctors, social support, adoption agencies 
etc. So that sets the scene for the specific individual decision. But, 
from the &quot;scoping&quot; point of view, the crucial thing is that when 
determining the Principle, anyone who has even just an academic or 
religious interest can legitimately participate in the debate and vote 
because we're determining Society's ethical views on the permissibility 
or otherwise of a specific behaviour.

But when it comes down to a single specific case, the &quot;constituency&quot; is 
reduced to a handful of &quot;voters&quot; and one of them, the pregnant woman, 
has both a super-vote AND a super-veto. Other participants have a minor 
vote and minor veto.

The woman can clearly refuse to have an abortion and no one can gain-say 
that; hence her super-veto. And she can insist on having an abortion 
regardless of anyone elses wishes - the super-vote. However, unless she 
intends to operate on herself, she has to attempt to get the 
co-operation (minor vote) of, at least, the medics in the case or else 
they can exercise their minor veto and refuse to carry out the abortion.

More importantly, assuming we're in a community in which abortion is 
permitted in principle, then none of the opponents of that policy have 
ANY right to be involved in the specific case.

So the scope is determined by whether we're talking principles or 
specifics. Principle (is a behaviour permitted/prohibited) is a matter 
for the community - which is, presumably, already self selected 
geographically or constitutionally. Specifics are decided by those 
directly affected by or required to implement the decision.

What it implies for our discussions is that there needs to be a means of 
objecting to an individual's participation in the decision on the 
grounds that do not form part of the &quot;constituency&quot;; they have no 
legitimate interest. (eg an Italian has no business poking his nose into 
a discussion of French anti-littering laws; a catholic priest has no 
business trying to persuade a jewish woman not to have an abortion)

************************
Ned raised the issue of &quot;too many issues&quot;, with which I agree.

I would also like to raise the issue (which I first raised many years 
ago!) of why the hell these discussions are still taking place in this 
medium (which is why I hardly ever contribute). Why aren't we debating 
this in a phpBB forum or similar, with all the proper tools at our 
disposal?
