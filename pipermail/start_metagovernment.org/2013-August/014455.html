<PRE>Hi all
The only money reformers that I follow are

positive money UK <A HREF="http://www.positivemoney.org/">http://www.positivemoney.org/</A>
american monetary Institute <A HREF="http://www.monetary.org/">http://www.monetary.org/</A>

100% reserve money under democratic control. Of course, democratic control is the key issue

  Discussing money is worthwhile. I'm not attacking any currency in particular. Lets and national currencies have the same design. 

yes.
 

  In my opinion inequity is a result of currency design. The main issue with current currency designs: it's the difference between your income and expenses that matters. If a currency by design offers the possibility of negative feedback that difference becomes less important. The act of receiving and spending money would become more influential. The design would give a voice to billions of people that have no influence today.

yes, somehow...

 


  Tinkering with currency design has one big advantage that in my opinion other approaches do not have: it can stay under the radar

thats what it does for centuries
 
  and slowly gain importance. 

and it never gained any importance at all...


 
  It does not require a broad consensus to have an influence.

who cares for some influence in academia, that doesnt change a thing and its impossible to convince those who will not &quot;profit&quot; from a change (mainstream &quot;neoclassical&quot; economists cannot be convinced. the different &quot;monetary schools&quot; in academia battle over this questions for decades if not even centuries...)

 
  In fact a succesful attempt would force an important change on the world's population without giving them a say in the matter.

nope, probably not. thing do not change because some people in academia discuss stuff, they only change because people act on something an actually DO STUFF :-)
all theory that needs to be known about this issues is already known. there is many people in academia in different times which said all u need to know. the problem lies in how to start implementing stuff, because it will never happen in a top down approach.

 
  I realise this but there's little that can be done. A modern successful currency design change would have a viral effect.

no, it wont. there is already many alternative currency designs out there and their representatives fight over the details, but in the end this is not important and not a topic people are interested in, because its too complex for most people to be interested in this topic. its just too abstract. it will never get viral because of a concept as such.
Bitcoin has gone viral to some degree, because bitcoin evangelists actually implemented and spread stuff. bitcoin works right now and it works in the whole world.

Its lots of hard work and many people who are actively involved in the bitcoin economy and who work hard to spread the word. in order to have synergetic effects, try to wrap ur head around bitcoin and think about how extend bitcoins with concepts like those u mentioned in the beginning, that maybe could have an effect, but even then, its hard.

    discussing money is a waste of time. you should rather discuss something which might become actionable. there are lots of designs for different &quot;money systems&quot; and people waste their time to discuss them over and over again, sometimes they even create regional money systems (there are quite a few in germany) and they all have their own cult of followers, but regarding the overall picture, they dont make a difference, because they are not a mainstream thing. when it comes to money, the 'network effect' is so strong, that is a total waste of time to try to attack EUR or USD or the like in a direct manner.

    But money is in some ways tied to equity or lets better say, the core ideas behind money and equity are similar and so are the rules and if you change one of them, its possible to change the other one too. i believe its way easier to tackle the equity issue which is also related to ownership and &quot;the right to vote&quot; then to tackle the money issue.

    ...this is everything i have to say when it comes to &quot;money&quot;

    just my 2 cents

      Now we're talking design. My agenda is  this: add negative feedback loops to the design of Money.

      If you have a gripe with somebody you can tag that person. From that moment on any 'coins' spent by this person will carry this tag. If your tag is 'I hate this guy' nothing much will happen.

      If your tag says 'criminal' you will be asked either to explain yourself or risk being tagged yourself.

      If I want to sell something my phone and the seller's phone will exchange coins. My phone will scan each coin and reject based on a pre-configured number of tags. If we need to exhange 500 coins and one coin is rejected that person will need to have 501 coins to close the transaction.

      This design - if ever accepted - would alter the work beyond recognition.

        Empirical claims regarding money?
        Your joking?
        We are talking about earth where a few families own 90% of the wealth on the planet.
        They monopolize everything for starters.
        Doctors ,contractors, financial institutions, manufacturing, all based on money and control.
        The list goes on and on. 
        Did you ever see how a chevy rusts? 
        Or how toyotas door handles fall off.
        Or dodge transmissions go bad?
        Its because of money. Cutting corners and saving costs on cheaper parts.
        Plus they intentionally do it to increase sales so the vehicle just makes it passed the warantee contract. Correct?
        But if there were no money issues whatsoever wouldn't you just make them the best you could .
        Saving all of that energy having to constantly rebuild vehicles. Or even a vehicle sharing system.
        Its nice to have a big truck but you don't need one every day.  There's many ideas that will work.
        What about the accidents caused by people who couldn't afford to make their vehicle safe on the road.
        But money stops everything and everything in the court system is about paying damages and financial responsibility.
        When you get a fine for driving how does that help anything?
        Other than cause undo stress on the individual.
        Wouldn't it make sense to use a point system to where if you got too many points you would just be required to attend driving classes or lose your license.
        Instead of someone who has money just pays and keeps on being an idiot driver.
        Do you know the stress human beings endure over the legal system?
        With the resources we have we could build the space program and just keep going with it. Instead of a competition it would be a shared challenge for the world we would get the materials to make it happen. 
        We need to show we are mature and can focus on goals.
        That's all we would have then is new goals for the human race.
        Humans would achieve greatness by the measure of sweat and work they have put into the community.
        Everyone would just have the best education.
        No money to want for the competition.
        You would be bettering yourself on a constant basis.
        If you had a vehicle, personal devices, clothes, nice shelter, and good food what else would you want? If you wanted to be a leader then participate more than others. Teach others and gain respect. 
        Humans with poor social skills can't just be rude because they have wealth.
        So we would all be measured solely on the type of human being you were. Not by what you had.
        Now you see guys that have every tool possible in their garage but don't know how to use any of them.
        Wouldn't it be wiser to basically have public garages with all the facilities that anyone could use?
        Or have large free loaner facilities?
        Don't even sell tools just make as many as we need.
        Money would not impede progress.
        We would grow at a massive rate.
        There wouldn't be any issue of poor maintenance because of money issues. 
        If we need something we just put in a writ or request for materials. Think of how many more inventions we would have.
        We would all be busy building for a very long time.
        The power companies make absolutely no sense.
        Why have we not made the power a public owned system yet? Its because of greed and control.
        Wouldn't it just make sense to build and maintain power plants using the best technology possible?
        These new forms of money are just new flavors of slavery.
        If money was worthless. It immedietly puts EVERYBODY on the same playing field. Then the lower intelligent would find their place as well as the highly intelligent if we all had access to the same opportunities.
        There could be children capable of massive medical breakthroughs that never were because of financial issues.
        So money is holding us back. 
        Communism was deliberatly ran into the ground because there were leaders of higher power.
        Metagovernment is about power to the people right?
        Think of opportunities you may have missed because of lack of money or trying to gain more.
        And there would be virtually no crime.
        I know its hard to grasp.
        Its the only way for no corruption.
        We wouldn't need anyone of higher power.
        Just random counsils of different levels of education for different needs.

          We shouldn't confuse Money with our current - and poorly designed -
          national currencies or with the gold standard.

          The question is: how should money be designed?

          &gt; Hi Mark,
          &gt;
          &gt; Ultimately, you appear to be making a set of empirical claims regarding money. As such, the claims are open to empirical (experimental) test, and potentially to falsification. Yes? (If the claims are not testable and potentially falsifiable, then they may fall into the category of quasi-religious belief -- immune to reason and discourse. If so, then there is nothing useful that can be said in response, and discussion would be a waste of time and effort.)
          &gt;
          &gt; I am open to the possibility that there may exist one or more scalable social system designs (that do not feature money) that would work out &quot;better&quot; than the various scalable social system designs that have been implemented up to this point on planet earth (that have featured money). Show me your design -- propose it. I would very much like to see it.
          &gt;
          &gt; Without having yet seen your design, and therefore speaking abstractly, my view is that you are &quot;throwing the baby out with the bathwater&quot;. We use money as a medium for transmitting energy, just as we use electricity as a medium for transmitting energy. I do not see money as being inevitably a root of enslavement and corruption, any more than I see electricity as being inevitably a root of enslavement and corruption.
          &gt;
          &gt; I have written out a series of proposals concerning money here:
          &gt; <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a">http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a</A>
          &gt;
          &gt; Perhaps you can use my proposals as foils in articulating your corresponding, competing proposals. And also, I will be interested to read any direct responses to my &quot;money proposals&quot; that you may have.
          &gt;
          &gt; I agree with you that, in designing our new social system, we want the design to forestall and mitigate corruption so far as possible, and to eliminate slavery entirely. If you can show me a social system design that does not feature money, and that can scale to the level of the global population, and that accomplishes those design aims (no slavery, not much corruption), you will definitely have my attention.
