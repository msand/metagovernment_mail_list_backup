<PRE>Meta-currency is not any one currency or system of currencies, but the intention is to create core protocols, think of it as HTML/HTTP for currencies.   Because of this, the answer to any of your specific questions would be &quot;yes&quot;. 

I'm not sure that there is a lot of active work going on that is specific to meta-currency, there is a loose community of people who have been working on the ideas.  There is a prototype or sorts under the name of flowplace (<A HREF="http://flowplace.org">http://flowplace.org</A>) which demonstrates the basics of what we have called the &quot;wealing cycle&quot; (under an analogy that wealth is to wealing as health is to healing).

The core idea are that there would be openness and transparency throughout the system, and we identified four domains of oppenness:

1. Open Rules (a language to declare the rules and processing of a connected group of currencies for a community).  The idea is that there would be a formal language that meta-currency engines could implement.  We have been mostly ruby based, so we have been thinking in terms of ruby DSLs (domain specific languages).
2. Open Identity where we can largely build off of the open identity work that has been done by others.
3. Open Transport -- mainly the principle that all participants in a community of flows can access the raw flows according to standard protocols.  Implementation of this would be largely using standard web protocols (RESTful apis with XML/JSON data)
4. Open Data -- goes more or less directly with 3 above.

You ask great questions and those are exactly the ones that each meta-currency community would have to answer for themselves.  The whole point of this effort is that we expect there to be a discovery process where each community has to define what is wealth for them and how to measure it and make it visible.

I'm pretty sure that every community will want to build on a similar cycle to the one at FlowPlace where cycles of wealth building declare and gather around &quot;intentions&quot; and these intentions go through refinement in planning and action phases, then they complete in reflection about what happened; an acknowledgement of successes and failures and sharing gratitude and celebration of what was completed.

</I>&gt;<i> meta-currency sounds interesting.
</I>&gt;<i> how would the process of establishin such a currency look like?
</I>&gt;<i> who would use it and why?
</I>&gt;<i> how would it be created and how would it vanish?
</I>&gt;<i> is there many or only one?
</I>&gt;<i> will there be exchange rates?
</I>&gt;<i>
