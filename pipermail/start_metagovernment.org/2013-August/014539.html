</I>
Sometimes we do, but its true that its currently difficult.
Without Voting, whats the indicator that signals a decision was made?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; If you implement what you have in mind, with email technology

</I>&gt;<i>    work and what not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; By &quot;what you have in mind&quot; do you mean Blinap? If not, please explain
</I>&gt;<i> a little further what it is that you are referring to ... What do I have in

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not so sure, but probably not blinap. is blinap what you have in mind?
I'm not saying that blinap cannot work, it probably would work somehow, but
i think that it would be very difficult for people to trust in the proposed
method.
....but sure, it could be implemented using email.


Next, I am not sure that I follow the basis for your apparent claim that
&gt;<i> content which appears in emails is &quot;real content&quot;, but when some of that
</I>&gt;<i> very content is moved to an AllAngles page, it becomes artificial content
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
have i said that?
what i wanted to say is, that content on a remote, where a link needs to be
clicked and in the worst case, a signup/login has to take place, it puts up
a barrier which most people will not overcome. (i explain it again further
down below)



Lastly, I confess that Bentley and I probably will spend time thinking
&gt;<i> about what would work and what not. Guilty as charged. (You are very much
</I>&gt;<i> invited to join in, by the way -- I hope you do.) :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; Why not use a &quot;harder technology&quot; but as a plus, have real
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    content to test your &quot;system design&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Again I find myself confused regarding the basis you are using to
</I>&gt;<i> distinguish between real and artificial content. Could you clarify?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

No, what i wanted to express is that:
IF you use a prototype that is NOT using email, THEN you can discuss some
topics just for the sake of testing the prototype, but probably its not
&quot;real world issues&quot;
(for example: i could implement a prototype and discuss &quot;legalize drugs&quot;
with some other co developers or &quot;alpha testers&quot; ... but we would be a
small group, mostly interested in the software as such and the discussion
about drugs would be somehow shallow, because it would be artificial.

If there were some activists and NGOs, which are into this issue for maybe
decades or more, then you would have lots of people who are very serious
about this &quot;legalize drugs&quot; topic and would try to use the tools to get
results.
If you have users who are serious about the content, then they will report
which functionality the tool is lacking, but if you do just shallow
discussion, its more likely, that you would only use the tool in ways it
already supports and wouldnt notice what it lacks, because there is no
&quot;serious discussion&quot; which could guide your needs.



------------------------------**------------------------------**------------
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also, I very much hope that you will hop over to the AllAngles page
</I>&gt;<i> where the email issue is being considered, and put in your two cents. Here
</I>&gt;<i> is the link again:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://allangles.co/Demo.html?**id=14&lt;http://allangles.co/Demo.html?id=14">http://allangles.co/Demo.html?**id=14&lt;http://allangles.co/Demo.html?id=14</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I have already clicked that link 3 or 4 times and read through the bullet
list.
But it will never be sufficient, because its shallow. I dont know which
points to add.
Remember: You copied those points into an email, ...was it you?... and i
answered/commented on all of those. How would i have integrated that kind
of feedback into allangles.co ? i dont know.
Who is the person which has put in those bullet points?
how did that person come up with those?
btw... reading through this list is boring.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I very much concur with your preference that the prototype website
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     not feature voting. (My impression is, that makes you and me a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     minority of 2 within the community, so we probably don't want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     call for a vote on the issue ...) :^)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If you want to set a prototype site up and need a playmate, I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     there. Also, I am poised to begin playing on the TruthMapping.com
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     site (setting up topics to debate), so we could spend some time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     playing over there some as well. And, we could play in standard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     wiki-pages, doing everything manually as we figure out in real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     time what we want to happen when and where, and writing out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     specifications as we do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     What you have just done in your most recent email, concisely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     laying out the arguments pro and con for using email as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     development base, I take to be a tremendous service to the community.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     To follow up on that excellent effort, one thing we might do in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the course of our prototyping efforts (to give us &quot;grist for our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     mill&quot;) would be to &quot;mine&quot; past listserv emails to extract out the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     dozens (hundreds!) of issues in the past that have been raised,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     only to have the subsequent discourse fizzle out without the issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     being settled. If we could extract and organize those, we could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     give them new life (they keep rising from the dead again and again
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     anyway), and give them a fighting chance to actually be settled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (through our new prototype system).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Our stock-in-trade in this community is decision making. We can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     start by *successfully* making our own decisions on our own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     issues, as proof-of-concept demonstration to the world that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     know what we are talking about when we offer the world our systems.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         someone put together a short requirement list like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I would prefer a system that has no voting at all. I have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         prototype of a way to decide if a proposal should succeed that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         does not use voting. Instead of voting people add reasons for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         or against passage of the proposal. Each statement for or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         against can also be affected by statements for or against it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         in a hierarchy. An objection could be made against the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         proposal but then other people could object to the objection,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         for example, by adding a statement that the objection is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         logical fallacy. The system weighs all the pros and cons and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         displays the confidence in the proposal (and all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         objections). I feel this is an example of a way to handle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         objections without voting.
