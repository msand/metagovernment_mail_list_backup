<PRE>Mark,

Thanks for your input. I agree that a cross platform app will be beneficial
in the future. Right now though we do not know what we are building so it's
important that we can quickly try out ideas. An app would quadruple costs
and delay each deployment.

Just because we deliver an email interface would not mean that we would
have to use it for other applications. How the data gets around should not
be limited by pop3 or any single technology.

Any interface would require a graphical interface as what we are trying to
accomplish could not be represented in text only.

Identity is a huge issue and many people are working on it right now. We
will be using the available identity providers. I don't think we can
improve on the current identity tools.

A vote might end the discussion but it probably would not solve the issue
in the best way. I am currently in the group of people that believe we
should develop better options than voting to solve group issues.

Regards,

Bentley Davis

</I>&gt;<i> If you decide to go with email. How hard would it be to make a specific
</I>&gt;<i> pop3 app for our phones. For those that wanted such. I honestly feel some
</I>&gt;<i> form of visual gui specific to MG because phsyocologicaly . Humans have to
</I>&gt;<i> see something for it to be real to them. Another thing should he
</I>&gt;<i> considered. I know off topic but a format for identification purposes. If
</I>&gt;<i> you wish to start bringing people together on this they need something to
</I>&gt;<i> make them feel permanent . Its a human characteristic . I do agree to those
</I>&gt;<i> that think a change should be made. But I also agree with those who wish it
</I>&gt;<i> could stay. What about cross platforming? I'm not sure on the specifics but
</I>&gt;<i> if we can relay voicemails to a text. I'm sure its not that hard. We need
</I>&gt;<i> to start using the metagovernment app then a vote could occur and this
</I>&gt;<i> would be decided already.
