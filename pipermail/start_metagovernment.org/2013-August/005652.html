<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I dont want to talk about money, because it leads to nowhere, because its
not actionable. I'm writing my thesis about money and the financial crisis
and am fine with it.

The thoughts i'd like to have input on is &quot;the rules of equity&quot;.
I'm not sure which angle is the right one to have a perspective on what i'd
like to propose so that people will not oppose it out of some kind of
learned reflexes.

*Whats entrepreneurship all about, from an equity point of view?*
Leave customers and product aside, its all about creating equity for
yourself and investors. Once you've it up and running, you might be able to
lean back and let the structure work for you. Thats why 98 of 100 persons
of the FORBES MAGAZINES &quot;Richest Persons Charts&quot; are entrepreneurs and
probably many of them within the financial industrie, because they leverage
the rules of money and equity.

*STATUS QUO*
Whats a common practice or topic you have to get into when you become an
entrepreneur and want to found a company? Its contract law and corporate
law.
You pay wages, you get shares, and often there are &quot;founder teams&quot;, so they
craft a company or partner agreement in which, amongst other things,
document:
- who gets how many shares?
- how many shares do external investors get?
- how might be able to vote to which degree?
- if an investor/partner leaves, will he lose his shares? can they be
bought back?
(think of facebook and the programer who helped zuckerberg in the early
stages)
- do partners have to earn there shares? (so called VESTING)

...so essentially, there is a lot of custom rules or best practices, like
(tag along, drag along <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag-along_right">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag-along_right</A>) ...
which are just set up to make sure what happens to EQUITY at any point in
time.


*NOW WHAT?*
Something that i believe to be essential in order for an alternative
approach to work, is a &quot;social process&quot; of constantly evaluating results to
measure progress from day one and have a lot of transpareceny (for example:
in a startup)

*3 Techniques which are already best practices in their domain*
*TECHNIQUE 1*
There is a method called &quot;Business Model Canvas&quot;, which is a top-down-view
of a startup which you draw on a canvas with your team (could also be done
digitally).
Then you attach hypotheses and their tests (todo's for the team) to every
area of the company (partners, (activities+ressources), product, (channels,
relations) customers) and work through them during the next week.
So you ITERATE through this process generating business model canvas after
business model canvas, making progress visible, + it helps to not lose
focus.

*TECHNIQUE 2*
There is a methodology called &quot;agile management technique&quot; and one of them
is called scrum. Most software developers should be familiar with it.
Within scum, there is a technique called &quot;PLANNING POKER&quot; which is some
kind of card game you run through before each 2-week-sprint-iteration
(which means 2 weeks of doing work) to upfront try to estimate how many
tasks you could accomplish from an priorityqueue of features/tasks.

*TECHNIQUE 3*
Financial Bookkeeping and Depreciation. Where many &quot;accounts&quot; exists and
you update them for each business transaction and you also calculate the
depreciation over time, so you know your &quot;true costs&quot; because you have to
bear &quot;replacement investments&quot; in mind.


*PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER*
Now if you use all those 3 techniques, you will eventually end up with a
process, where a digital business model canvas can give transparencey to
all participants about the current state of the company. Combined with the
Planning Poker Approach, its possible to measure progress or do some kind
of bookkeeping or point system, where you measure how much all your points
are worth and after each iteration you could reevaluate in retrospective to
what degree your assumptions became true and this practice will sharpen
everyones ability to make such guesses (learning process).

Now if you also account for depreciation (some todo's, like results of &quot;a
customer interview&quot; or &quot;cleaning a room&quot; will depreciate faster than a
bought &quot;office table&quot;), you could calculate an average rate of depreciation
with which earned points waste away.
Then there is also those points who have to be &quot;written off&quot; after you did
some kind of work which turned out to be a waste of time.... ...but the
process of this is weaved into the CORE TECHNIQUE (with business model
canvas) around which you build everything else and which helps you to keep
focus.


*What does it mean? And how is this related to the &quot;STATUS QUO&quot;?*
1. Now, what if i buy an office chair and give it &quot;points&quot; during a weekly
planning poker session? The &quot;office chair&quot; also has a value in &quot;USD&quot; or
&quot;EUR&quot;. If many companies will do this approach, you essentially get an
&quot;exchange rate&quot; between your companies internal point system and &quot;USD&quot; or
&quot;EUR&quot; and the like.
2. What if this process works well, why not make these points REAL SHARES?
And if you do so, why not make everyones SHARES waste away with the average
rate of depreciation, so that people have to re-invest, in order to not
lose all their shares over time? (=&gt; This will essentially make all this
equity agreements or &quot;VESTING&quot; rules kind of superfluous, because if
someone decides to quit and doesnt want to sell his shares, they will waste
away over time)
Why should I invest work in earning shares if they waste away???
Because as long as you have shares, they decide on a potentially &quot;real time
basis&quot; how much of the companies revenue (in USD or EUR or the like...)
goes into your pocket. So you dont work for a wage, but for those points
which eventually are shares and which will decide your monetary income flow
(potentially minutely dividends)

IF this techniques, which in practice should make the average person better
off, becomes mainstream practice (which is totally possible, because if
there are role models who work this way successfully, it will spread
virally, because it will mean more money and more power with less work for
everyone beside the top 1%, but it has to start bottom-up and success of
practicioners will automatically spread it and make it a mainstream
practice.
... THEN: shareholders will lose equity over time to those who are actively
doing the work, which makes the rules fair again. And because everyone or
every company will create their &quot;point system&quot; which will end up having an
exchange rate in EUR/USD, they all get used to this and it will or might
lay a foundation to tackle the monetary system as such, but for now, this
is totally of reach.
