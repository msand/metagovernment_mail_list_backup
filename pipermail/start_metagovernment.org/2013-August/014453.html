<PRE>Hi Alex, (Great response!)

In just this little exchange between the two of us, we have now opened 
up several fundamental matters to be decided (between the two of us, as 
precursor to having others agree as well). As you say, agreements must 
start small -- between individuals.

Because the matters that have been opened are so fundamental (even 
partly below awareness), it may take some work to articulate them 
clearly and agree on the articulation. Also, it will probably be best to 
tackle them one at a time. Let us start with: &quot;What is our business?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; I dont know your definition of corporation, but democracy
    mainly happens on the street through spending money or not on
    certain things, and it happens every day during work time.

The Metagovernment community is now on the way to becoming a non-profit 
startup. The startup will be in the business of attracting donations and 
then spending that money to design, develop and deploy democratic 
decision systems.

You and I and the other members of the Metagovernment community are 
already part of that startup. We have equity in the startup by virtue of 
our participation -- which is just the way you want it to be.

If we ourselves (Metagovernment) are unable to agree upon a full direct 
democratic decision system design through which we ourselves can then 
make decisions in operating our own startup, then &quot;they&quot; (anyone outside 
of our own community) would be silly to suppose that we have any special 
expertise that would help &quot;them&quot; to make decisions democratically.

We need to &quot;dine on our own dogfood&quot; as proof-of-concept that we know 
what we are talking about, so that when we approach others outside of 
our community for donations or as prospective users of our systems, they 
won't just laugh at us (e.g., &quot;let me know when they finish playing in 
the sandbox&quot;).

    You say: &quot;a job is where democracy happens&quot;. 

I say, right here right now is where democracy happens, between you and 
I, in this discourse. (This is our work environment -- yours and mine.) 
In each instance that we (you and I) succeed in reaching agreement, we 
have taken one more small step toward full global direct democracy.

    You say: &quot;The work people do every day is what they have insight
    into and what they are familiar with.&quot;

The work that you and I do every day has to do with conceiving and 
designing and discussing democratic decision systems. That is what we 
(you and I) have insight into and what we are familiar with. We need to 
help *ourselves* argue about it and make *ourselves* owners of our 
personal work environment. Then maybe our own self esteem will increase, 
and we may feel comfortable enough to tackle the next layer in the 
hierarchy in a democratic fashion. Our own work together (you and I) 
will then grow bottom up and so will the tools THAT WE OURSELVES USE, in 
doing our own work together.

    You say: &quot;Its easier to create a tool and make people use it, when
    you start with a startup or a project team and make it work&quot;.

We are a startup. We (self-selected members of the Metagovernment 
community) have equity in that startup. We can start with us. We can 
start with us NOW.

We (you and I and other community members) begin by reaching agreements, 
one after another after another, as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
(The aim is not to aimlessly, endlessly chatter. The aim is to reach 
agreements, one after another after another, as quickly and efficiently 
as possible. Our progress is measured by the quality and quantity of 
that growing corpus of agreements.)

At this point, we don't have any special tools. We have only listserv 
emails and wiki-pages. But even just those tools are sufficient to 
enable us to work toward growing our corpus of agreements. We just need 
to focus on our business: making proposals and reaching agreements. That 
is the business of our startup. That is what we produce, and what we 
will be helping others produce.

Do you agree? (Shall we start making proposals with the aim of reaching 
agreements?)

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Paul and Alex,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Paul, thanks for the link to the CESJ material -- good stuff!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Alex, I very much agree with you that social arrangements that
</I>&gt;<i>     maintain and increase concentration of wealth/power are problems
</I>&gt;<i>     to be solved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     To the extent that a particular corporation &quot;succeeds&quot; (from the
</I>&gt;<i>     perspective of its owners), wealth/power are concentrated (in the
</I>&gt;<i>     corporation, and in the owners of the corporation). This is not a
</I>&gt;<i>     problem from the perspective of the corporation, but is a problem
</I>&gt;<i>     from the perspective of the rest of humanity, and nature, and
</I>&gt;<i>     future generations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I don't quite understand what leads you think that tinkering with
</I>&gt;<i>     the rules of equity (within corporations) will solve the problems
</I>&gt;<i>     that corporations keep causing for the world as a whole (poverty,
</I>&gt;<i>     war, environmental destruction, etc.). Each corporation will still
</I>&gt;<i>     be narrowly pursuing its own interests, with the rest of us having
</I>&gt;<i>     no choice but to continue trusting &quot;The Invisible Hand&quot; to protect
</I>&gt;<i>     the rest of us from corporate predations. (We have been trusting
</I>&gt;<i>     The Invisible Hand for the last few hundred years, and things have
</I>&gt;<i>     not been going so well ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its difficult to answer.
</I>&gt;<i> What is &quot;the invisible hand&quot;? This is to fuzzy to me to really respond.
</I>&gt;<i> If people do nothing, contracts or equity rules will first make those 
</I>&gt;<i> without equity suffer,
</I>&gt;<i> because the shareholders will squeeze them out to reduce &quot;variable costs&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> At some point in time, the money system will take over, because 
</I>&gt;<i> existing contracts, mainly serving liabilities has precedence over 
</I>&gt;<i> serving equity, the shareholders will be squeezed out in favor of the 
</I>&gt;<i> money owners....
</I>&gt;<i> (think my english is not that good, but hope u can follow the thought)
</I>&gt;<i> Some corporations can go without debt, but only because other 
</I>&gt;<i> corporations or the government or private households are loaded with 
</I>&gt;<i> that debt instead.
</I>&gt;<i> no having any debt as a corporation is not a solution that could be 
</I>&gt;<i> applied by the average corporation.
</I>&gt;<i> ...but then again, i think its a waste of time to argue about money or 
</I>&gt;<i> complain about money, because in my view, the only lever which exists 
</I>&gt;<i> that could be potentially used to tackle money, is equity :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You already summarized my idea in a couple of bullet points.
</I>&gt;<i> Could you be more precise of what u dont understand? Maybe its easier 
</I>&gt;<i> then for me to respond more specifically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; I think, because people are not used to this, it's not
</I>&gt;<i>     easy to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        sell the idea and people will be very sceptical in the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It is pretty easy to predict that the people who will most
</I>&gt;<i>     skeptical will be the richest people in the world. Any particular
</I>&gt;<i>     startup can indeed choose to &quot;spread the wealth&quot; internally, but
</I>&gt;<i>     then the richest people will back competitors to the startup that
</I>&gt;<i>     give them better equity deals, and will instruct their captured
</I>&gt;<i>     politicians and regulators to make trouble for any startup that
</I>&gt;<i>     presumes to try to &quot;spread the wealth&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wasnt talking about the rich people with lots of power. I was 
</I>&gt;<i> talking about the average worker. They will be very sceptical in the 
</I>&gt;<i> beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> You are right, that those people who own so much right now might be 
</I>&gt;<i> sceptical too, and maybe with good reason, but maybe they will even 
</I>&gt;<i> support it, because they themselves are trapped in the rules of the 
</I>&gt;<i> system. Some of them might know, some or most of them might not know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As Paul suggested, &quot;binary economics&quot; presents arrangements that
</I>&gt;<i>     are very close to what you are suggesting. The CESJ organization
</I>&gt;<i>     (that has been promulgating binary economics) has been in business
</I>&gt;<i>     since 1984, as yet without much success (you and I had never even
</I>&gt;<i>     heard of them). If you want &quot;real effects NOW&quot;, starting with
</I>&gt;<i>     trying to change the rules of equity within corporations may not
</I>&gt;<i>     be the best choice. The attempt would be unlikely to succeed
</I>&gt;<i>     against the opposition of the richest people in the world, and
</I>&gt;<i>     even if it did succeed, the world would still be at the mercy of
</I>&gt;<i>     successful corporations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. I see no other way, even if what i propose isnt easy to do
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What a corporation is, will change with those new rules established
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Rich people have no way of opposing, because talent will be 
</I>&gt;<i> attracted to the new way, all you have to do is provide the rules 
</I>&gt;<i> which enable &quot;working together efficiently&quot; while having greater 
</I>&gt;<i> benefits than working for a traditional corporation. (benefits mean: 
</I>&gt;<i> earn more money, have more power (because of shares))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; But there's also the problems of how people will decide,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        because if there is many shareholders, the problem of how to
</I>&gt;<i>        establish good democratic pratices supported by the proper tools,
</I>&gt;<i>        follows immediately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     YES! My view is that in order to really solve &quot;the problems of
</I>&gt;<i>     concentrated power&quot;, we need to create, demonstrate, and
</I>&gt;<i>     popularize a full direct democracy, that is capable of rendering
</I>&gt;<i>     corporations obsolete, globally. (Because people are not used to
</I>&gt;<i>     this, it's not easy to sell the idea and people will be very
</I>&gt;<i>     skeptical in the beginning ...) :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> YES! ..and NO! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;popularize a full direct democry&quot; ... YES!
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;capable of rendering corporations obsolete&quot; ....WHAT? :-)
</I>&gt;<i> I dont know your definition of corporation, but democracy mainly 
</I>&gt;<i> happens on the street through spending money or not on certain things, 
</I>&gt;<i> and it happens every day during work time.
</I>&gt;<i> you do what your boss tells you to do and if you are a &quot;good worker&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> then ur boss might give u a bit more power, so u can tell other people 
</I>&gt;<i> what to do.
</I>&gt;<i> The good thing with this is, that there is a tendency that those in 
</I>&gt;<i> power make better and more &quot;grown up&quot; decisions than those not in 
</I>&gt;<i> power, because they will be only brought into power if they seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> understand what they are doing, but on the other hand, they also act 
</I>&gt;<i> in their own best interest and maybe their bosses interest  and those 
</I>&gt;<i> who dont do will not be brought into power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if u really want people to experience DIRECT DEMOCRACY, bring it to 
</I>&gt;<i> money (i believe thats currently not possible yet) and bring it to the 
</I>&gt;<i> 40hours of work u do every week.
</I>&gt;<i> Thats where people experience democracy and thats where they can start 
</I>&gt;<i> to grow up until they eventually end up in washington ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> First, workers, through equity, get control of their work environment 
</I>&gt;<i> and they have to collaborate with their coworkers which then will be 
</I>&gt;<i> coowners.
</I>&gt;<i> Then they start to take over the supply chains, that means democratic 
</I>&gt;<i> corporations will work together... then they will clim up further, and 
</I>&gt;<i> every times its all the average people and their 40h work. they will 
</I>&gt;<i> not be workers anymore, they will be owners or co-owners. ..p2p-owners?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you do not build DIRECT DEMOCRACY as an architecture designed by 
</I>&gt;<i> some smart academics as a system and a software which then will be 
</I>&gt;<i> brought upon the masses in a top-down-fashion, NO :-) it has to start 
</I>&gt;<i> small, in the real world, in every persons personal every-day-life, 
</I>&gt;<i> that means &quot;during work hours&quot; and &quot;during money spending hours&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> the first needs the rules of equity to be changed.
</I>&gt;<i> the second needs the rules of money to be changed, but the second is 
</I>&gt;<i> very hard to tackle, so i propose one should try to tackle equity 
</I>&gt;<i> first and because money is in part based on equity, if equity changes, 
</I>&gt;<i> it might make the money system vulnerable so that it can be tackled too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In order to decide to change the rules of equity, or the rules of
</I>&gt;<i>     money, or any other rules, we need a new decision system through
</I>&gt;<i>     which to decide such things. That has to come first. We need to
</I>&gt;<i>     decide, together, how we are going to decide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> YES! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> But i think its a waste of time to think of &quot;nation wide government&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> or even only &quot;community government&quot; ... i heard people complain about 
</I>&gt;<i> that people are not interested in discussing stuff, or tool which LACK 
</I>&gt;<i> PEOPLE who want to discuss things...
</I>&gt;<i> You know why? Because what people do 40h a week is a job. A job is 
</I>&gt;<i> were democracy happens or most commonly NOT. Its where it has to start.
</I>&gt;<i> Bring democracy to the average work environment. A software that 
</I>&gt;<i> enables people to democratically decide on where, how, what ...and the 
</I>&gt;<i> like... they work.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> they are familiar with.
</I>&gt;<i> Help them to argue about it and make them owners of their personal

</I>&gt;<i> After some time, their self esteem will increase and they might feel

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its easier to create a tool and make people us it, when you start with 
</I>&gt;<i> a startup or a project team and make it work, then you try to enable 
</I>&gt;<i> it for larger teams and small established companies, then you try to 
</I>&gt;<i> make it work for several teams and several small companies which work 
</I>&gt;<i> together in a network.
</I>&gt;<i> then you try to make it word for average sized companies and so on... 
</I>&gt;<i> and it will grow.
</I>&gt;<i> bottom up and the software will evolve through the experience which is 
</I>&gt;<i> gained on the way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (&quot;We&quot; means you and me and Paul and Stephen and Conseo and Ed and
</I>&gt;<i>     Pietro and Mike and the other members of the Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i>     community and then others in the broader e-dem population, and so
</I>&gt;<i>     on. We talk about the importance of starting at the community
</I>&gt;<i>     level, but then we don't do it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and i believe its WRONG to start at the community level. The 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;community level&quot; is far to BIG for the average person. Its a myth or 
</I>&gt;<i> fairy tale which is told in elementary school.
</I>&gt;<i> In reality, the &quot;community level&quot; is integrated into the &quot;economic 
</I>&gt;<i> system&quot; and it depends on the &quot;public institution&quot; or &quot;community size&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> which &quot;lobbiests&quot; are interested in that comunity and which managers 
</I>&gt;<i> or politicians act on which interestes. Those interests are not the 
</I>&gt;<i> direct interests of those people who meet and talk (politicians at the 
</I>&gt;<i> community level + company managers + several others) ...in short: 
</I>&gt;<i> agents which represent some kind of &quot;partial collective will&quot; (so to 
</I>&gt;<i> say, i know my words are sometimes a bit strange, but its because i 
</I>&gt;<i> lack good english skills).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the ONLY &quot;domain&quot; average people know about is their every day 
</I>&gt;<i> life. Its the &quot;domain&quot; where they have good knowledge and can make 
</I>&gt;<i> decisions. It has to start THERE, then give them feedback, so they 
</I>&gt;<i> will learn and at some point, they will grow to the &quot;next level&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> if they have taken several levels, at some point, they will arrive at 
</I>&gt;<i> the COMMUNITY LEVEL, together with all the other citizens which might 
</I>&gt;<i> use similar processes and tools at their work place to self govern it 
</I>&gt;<i> all They will then start to discuss community issues, because they 
</I>&gt;<i> will know about the challanges... :-)
</I>&gt;<i> ...then it will go beyond the community level, but starting with the 
</I>&gt;<i> community level is wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> better start in peoples every day life, which is the work environment.

</I>&gt;<i>             It seems that you have the makings for starting a startup: a

</I>&gt;<i>             the perspective of society as a whole, or nature, or future
</I>&gt;<i>             generations).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I went through what you wrote and tried to pick out the
</I>&gt;<i>         problems
</I>&gt;<i>             that you are trying to solve. Here is what I came up with:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>             their domain_
</I>&gt;<i>                 *TECHNIQUE 1*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 There is a method called &quot;Business Model Canvas&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>             which is a
</I>&gt;<i>                 top-down-view of a startup which you draw on a canvas
</I>&gt;<i>             with your
</I>&gt;<i>                 team (could also be done digitally).
</I>&gt;<i>                 Then you attach hypotheses and their tests (todo's for
</I>&gt;<i>             the team)
</I>&gt;<i>                 to every area of the company (partners,
</I>&gt;<i>             (activities+ressources),
</I>&gt;<i>                 product, (channels, relations) customers) and work
</I>&gt;<i>             through them
</I>&gt;<i>                 during the next week.
</I>&gt;<i>                 So you ITERATE through this process generating
</I>&gt;<i>             business model
</I>&gt;<i>                 canvas after business model canvas, making progress
</I>&gt;<i>             visible, + it
</I>&gt;<i>                 helps to not lose focus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 *TECHNIQUE 2*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 There is a methodology called &quot;agile management
</I>&gt;<i>             technique&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i>                 one of them is called scrum. Most software developers
</I>&gt;<i>             should be
</I>&gt;<i>                 familiar with it. Within scum, there is a technique called
</I>&gt;<i>                 &quot;PLANNING POKER&quot; which is some kind of card game you
</I>&gt;<i>             run through
</I>&gt;<i>                 before each 2-week-sprint-iteration (which means 2
</I>&gt;<i>             weeks of doing
</I>&gt;<i>                 work) to upfront try to estimate how many tasks you could
</I>&gt;<i>                 accomplish from an priorityqueue of features/tasks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 *TECHNIQUE 3*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 Financial Bookkeeping and Depreciation. Where many
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;accounts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>                 exists and you update them for each business
</I>&gt;<i>             transaction and you
</I>&gt;<i>                 also calculate the depreciation over time, so you know
</I>&gt;<i>             your &quot;true
</I>&gt;<i>                 costs&quot; because you have to bear &quot;replacement
</I>&gt;<i>             investments&quot; in mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 *PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 Now if you use all those 3 techniques, you will
</I>&gt;<i>             eventually end up
</I>&gt;<i>                 with a process, where a digital business model canvas
</I>&gt;<i>             can give
</I>&gt;<i>                 transparencey to all participants about the current
</I>&gt;<i>             state of the
</I>&gt;<i>                 company. Combined with the Planning Poker Approach,
</I>&gt;<i>             its possible
</I>&gt;<i>                 to measure progress or do some kind of bookkeeping or
</I>&gt;<i>             point
</I>&gt;<i>                 system, where you measure how much all your points are
</I>&gt;<i>             worth and
</I>&gt;<i>                 after each iteration you could reevaluate in
</I>&gt;<i>             retrospective to
</I>&gt;<i>                 what degree your assumptions became true and this
</I>&gt;<i>             practice will
</I>&gt;<i>                 sharpen everyones ability to make such guesses
</I>&gt;<i>             (learning process).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 Now if you also account for depreciation (some todo's,
</I>&gt;<i>             like
</I>&gt;<i>                 results of &quot;a customer interview&quot; or &quot;cleaning a room&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>             will
</I>&gt;<i>                 depreciate faster than a bought &quot;office table&quot;), you could
</I>&gt;<i>                 calculate an average rate of depreciation with which
</I>&gt;<i>             earned
</I>&gt;<i>                 points waste away.
</I>&gt;<i>                 Then there is also those points who have to be
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;written off&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>                 after you did some kind of work which turned out to be
</I>&gt;<i>             a waste of
</I>&gt;<i>                 time.... ...but the process of this is weaved into the
</I>&gt;<i>             CORE
</I>&gt;<i>                 TECHNIQUE (with business model canvas) around which
</I>&gt;<i>             you build
</I>&gt;<i>                 everything else and which helps you to keep focus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 *What does it mean? And how is this related to the
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;STATUS QUO&quot;?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 1. Now, what if i buy an office chair and give it
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;points&quot; during
</I>&gt;<i>                 a weekly planning poker session? The &quot;office chair&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>             also has a
</I>&gt;<i>                 value in &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot;. If many companies will do
</I>&gt;<i>             this approach,
</I>&gt;<i>                 you essentially get an &quot;exchange rate&quot; between your
</I>&gt;<i>             companies
</I>&gt;<i>                 internal point system and &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot; and the like.
</I>&gt;<i>                 2. What if this process works well, why not make these
</I>&gt;<i>             points
</I>&gt;<i>                 REAL SHARES? And if you do so, why not make everyones
</I>&gt;<i>             SHARES
</I>&gt;<i>                 waste away with the average rate of depreciation, so
</I>&gt;<i>             that people
</I>&gt;<i>                 have to re-invest, in order to not lose all their
</I>&gt;<i>             shares over
</I>&gt;<i>                 time? (=&gt; This will essentially make all this equity
</I>&gt;<i>             agreements
</I>&gt;<i>                 or &quot;VESTING&quot; rules kind of superfluous, because if someone
</I>&gt;<i>                 decides to quit and doesnt want to sell his shares,
</I>&gt;<i>             they will
</I>&gt;<i>                 waste away over time)
</I>&gt;<i>                 Why should I invest work in earning shares if they
</I>&gt;<i>             waste away???
</I>&gt;<i>                 Because as long as you have shares, they decide on a
</I>&gt;<i>             potentially
</I>&gt;<i>                 &quot;real time basis&quot; how much of the companies revenue
</I>&gt;<i>             (in USD or
</I>&gt;<i>                 EUR or the like...) goes into your pocket. So you dont
</I>&gt;<i>             work for a
</I>&gt;<i>                 wage, but for those points which eventually are shares
</I>&gt;<i>             and which
</I>&gt;<i>                 will decide your monetary income flow (potentially
</I>&gt;<i>             minutely
</I>&gt;<i>                 dividends)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 IF this techniques, which in practice should make the
</I>&gt;<i>             average
</I>&gt;<i>                 person better off, becomes mainstream practice (which
</I>&gt;<i>             is totally
</I>&gt;<i>                 possible, because if there are role models who work
</I>&gt;<i>             this way
</I>&gt;<i>                 successfully, it will spread virally, because it will
</I>&gt;<i>             mean more
</I>&gt;<i>                 money and more power with less work for everyone
</I>&gt;<i>             beside the top
</I>&gt;<i>                 1%, but it has to start bottom-up and success of
</I>&gt;<i>             practicioners
</I>&gt;<i>                 will automatically spread it and make it a mainstream
</I>&gt;<i>             practice.
</I>&gt;<i>                 ... THEN: shareholders will lose equity over time to
</I>&gt;<i>             those who
</I>&gt;<i>                 are actively doing the work, which makes the rules
</I>&gt;<i>             fair again.
</I>&gt;<i>                 And because everyone or every company will create
</I>&gt;<i>             their &quot;point
</I>&gt;<i>                 system&quot; which will end up having an exchange rate in
</I>&gt;<i>             EUR/USD,
</I>&gt;<i>                 they all get used to this and it will or might lay a
</I>&gt;<i>             foundation
</I>&gt;<i>                 to tackle the monetary system as such, but for now,
</I>&gt;<i>             this is
</I>&gt;<i>                 totally of reach.

</I>&gt;<i>                         i'm sure everyone here knows theres lots of
</I>&gt;<i>             issues with
</I>&gt;<i>                         democracy and voting and lots of stuff that
</I>&gt;<i>             could be
</I>&gt;<i>                         improved on that &quot;frontier&quot;, but i came to
</I>&gt;<i>             think, that
</I>&gt;<i>                         there is some very related subjects and thats
</I>&gt;<i>             equity and
</I>&gt;<i>                         money.
</I>&gt;<i>                         Equity gives you votes in the context of your
</I>&gt;<i>             equity.
</I>&gt;<i>                         Money gives you the right to buy and thus vote
</I>&gt;<i>             on who
</I>&gt;<i>                         will prosper and who will not (voting with
</I>&gt;<i>             your purse...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                         I came to the conclusion, that the rules/laws
</I>&gt;<i>             around
</I>&gt;<i>                         money are broken and so are the rules around
</I>&gt;<i>             equity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                         Do you know the forbes magazine and their
</I>&gt;<i>             listing of the
</I>&gt;<i>                         100 richest persons on the planet? 98 of them are
</I>&gt;<i>                         entrepreneurs, 1 is Steve Balmer from
</I>&gt;<i>             Microsoft and the
</I>&gt;<i>                         last one, i dont know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                         If you want to get insanely rich, u have to
</I>&gt;<i>             abuse the
</I>&gt;<i>                         broken laws for equity, thus found and raise a
</I>&gt;<i>             successful
</I>&gt;<i>                         company.
</I>&gt;<i>                         The other way would be to get into the financial
</I>&gt;<i>                         industrie and instead of abusing broken equity
</I>&gt;<i>             rules, u
</I>&gt;<i>                         would abuse broken money laws.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                         In essence it eneables you to live of of other
</I>&gt;<i>             peoples
</I>&gt;<i>                         work to some degree.
</I>&gt;<i>                         These broken laws are the main, if not the
</I>&gt;<i>             ONLY reason
</I>&gt;<i>                         for the &quot;great and ever stretching divide&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>             between rich
</I>&gt;<i>                         and poor. Its also the reason for the
</I>&gt;<i>             financial crisis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                         I believe money is an issue that cannot be
</I>&gt;<i>             tackled right
</I>&gt;<i>                         now and have a couple of arguments why i think
</I>&gt;<i>             that to be
</I>&gt;<i>                         true which i dont want to get into now, but i
</I>&gt;<i>             think its
</I>&gt;<i>                         totally possible to tackle the equity issue
</I>&gt;<i>             and i believe
</I>&gt;<i>                         with the equity issue tackled, the money issue
</I>&gt;<i>             will
</I>&gt;<i>                         follow by itself sooner or later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                         Does this topic somehow sound interesting? If
</I>&gt;<i>             so, i would
</I>&gt;<i>                         really like to get into the details, but if
</I>&gt;<i>             there is
</I>&gt;<i>                         nobody on this list who is interested in these
</I>&gt;<i>             topics, i
</I>&gt;<i>                         dont want to waste your time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                         kind regards
</I>&gt;<i>                         alex
