<PRE>@Ned
Sounds ok to me. Maybe those &quot;decisions of the past&quot; (what u call filters
to be passed by new decisions) should have an &quot;expire&quot; date, such that they
have to be &quot;confirmed&quot; once in a while or else will vanish.

@Ed
I dont think that the IRS should have any priority.
what do we need money for anyway? whats all that 'ngo crap' anyway? and why
would u want people to donate money?
Is there a plan what that money would be used for? (havent seen it)
What would it help? Most of the work is thinking stuff through and
implementing it.

Better to find a valid business model (maybe even bitcoin based?), so that
donations are NOT NEEDED. the &quot;single responsible person principle&quot; in
itself is part of the pyramid scheme.
Why would any single beeing be responsible for decisions that were made as
a collective?!?!? Wouldnt that individual beeing want some kind of 'veto'
rights to prevent decision to be made which might held it accountable?
The whole idea is flawed. You cannot have grass roots decision on how to
spend money, but have an individual held accountable.


Like i wrote in my other email, metagovernment has to think that issue
through.
how to decide on the distribution of money and shares and responsibility?
there's lots of questions unanswered.
democracy must start at peoples workplaces and thus, a democratic system
with its subsystems must be capable of running a 150 person strong company
and help several of these companies to manage their interrelated issues.

</I>&gt;<i> The organization I am talking about would be an American non-profit

</I>&gt;<i> under United States law so that it could be eligible for grants from
</I>&gt;<i> foundations. For that purpose, the bylaws need to be a document that shows
</I>&gt;<i> the IRS and the foundations that it is a responsible organization -- and by
</I>&gt;<i> responsible, they mean that money is managed responsibly and that someone
</I>&gt;<i> will be held to account if it is mismanaged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's an example of US nonprofit org bylaws:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://form1023.org/how-to-draft-nonprofit-bylaws-with-examples">http://form1023.org/how-to-draft-nonprofit-bylaws-with-examples</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am planning on engaging legal advice to help in drafting our bylaws in
</I>&gt;<i> such a way that they can make the IRS and the foundations happy but also
</I>&gt;<i> not violate our principles. That's going to be very difficult, but if it
</I>&gt;<i> can be done, there is a great side-benefit in that we'll be creating a
</I>&gt;<i> model for other organizations to start up using collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bylaws you draft below would be more for the global group, right? I
</I>&gt;<i> just want to point out that we have two other branches that overlap with
</I>&gt;<i> what you're presenting:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For adding on another layer as you propose, I think it may be helpful to
</I>&gt;<i> address each of your points below in a separate conversation. There's a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of weighty stuff there, and each point should probably be examined by the
</I>&gt;<i> group.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What follows is a first draft of proposed bylaws for &quot;an organization to
</I>&gt;<i> serve us&quot;. This would be the global metagovernment (I have called it a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;society&quot;) that would drive all of the various national foundations and
</I>&gt;<i> such around the world.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The draft also exists as a wiki-page:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Society_Bylaws">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Society_Bylaws</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  1. *MEMBERSHIP: UNCOERCED*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Any sentient being (globally) may freely choose to become a member
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     of the society. Any member may freely choose to cease to be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     member of the society.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  2. *DECISION MAKING: DIRECT DEMOCRACY*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Each member of the society is free to participate in making any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     decision that the society makes. Each member participates in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     decision making on equal footing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     (Emergency decisions are made through a subordinate emergency
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     response system. Any member may participate in the post-emergency
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     reviews of decisions made during emergencies.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  3. *PARTICIPATION: THROUGH PROPOSING*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Members participate in decision making exclusively through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     making.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  4. *DECISION RULE: NO UNRESOLVED OBJECTIONS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     *
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     The decision rule is that a proposal is cleared to be implemented
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     at the point that it faces no unresolved objections. Objections
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     are proposed. Objections are resolved through successive,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     recursive proposing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  5. *NOTIFICATION: PROPOSAL PROFILES, PROPOSAL MAGNETS*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Effecting direct democracy at the scale of the global population
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     requires that the decision system have an affordable sub-system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     that reliably notifies each member of new proposals that may be of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     interest, and that avoids inundating individuals with new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     proposals not of interest. The details of the software and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     practices that will together effect efficient and reliable global
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     notification will be co-created and evolved through successive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     successful proposing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  6. *APPLYING PAST DECISIONS: APPRAISAL*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     In order for the decision system to be affordable and reliable at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the scale of the global population, it must have a sub-system that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     efficiently and reliably applies all relevant past decisions to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     each new proposal that is submitted. (The past decisions serve as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     filters; each new proposal must successfully &quot;pass through&quot; all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     such filters in order to be cleared for implementation.) The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     details of the software and practices that will together effect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     this will be co-created and evolved through successive successful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     proposing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  7. *AMENDMENTS: THROUGH PROPOSING*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Additions and amendments to these bylaws may be effected through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     successfully proposing.
