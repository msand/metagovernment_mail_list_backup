</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes.


&gt;<i> The system does not know which point(s) you are specifically interacting
</I>&gt;<i> with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
At least, normaly, theres a paragraph of a couple of sentences you reply
to, like i do right now to (There may be a confusion ..... some points get
lost.)



&gt;<i> It then can not present the interactions in the proper context so you are
</I>&gt;<i> not able to easily follow a thread on a specific point or justification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The context is the paragraph  (There may be a confusion ... some points get
lost.)
But that paragraph might itself have context, so i agree, its not easy.




&gt;<i> It would be helpful to be able to reply to only a specific point or a
</I>&gt;<i> group of points in context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes.


By asking people to separate their sentences into distinct concepts and
&gt;<i> separate justifications a system could allow others to comment on a
</I>&gt;<i> specific point or justification more easily and visually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, but there is a risk, that people wont use the system at all if it
&quot;demands&quot; too much.
To my memory, i never said it would be easy, but instead of forcing people
upfront to adhere to some kind of structuring, i'd suggest, to offer them
some kind of structuring mechanism that makes it at least easy to parse
parts of their &quot;reply content&quot; into a structure that allows faster progress
in the discussion.
If those mechanisms are adopted, then one is able ot &quot;make the next step&quot;.




&gt;<i> You could possible still include multiple points and justification in a
</I>&gt;<i> single post.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
People probably will do act that way, yes.



&gt;<i> You could then still do all you outlined above with a smaller change to
</I>&gt;<i> the way people do it. We might allow people to highlight a set of text and
</I>&gt;<i> comment on that group. The challenge is how to visually represent it in an
</I>&gt;<i> understandable way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I think, its still awesome to, like i do right now, take a somehow &quot;random&quot;
part of text (I currently use (&quot;You could then still do all.... .... ...in
an understandable way)
...and comment on it, including questions, counter proposals, normal
comments, up/down votes, and so on....
The challenge might be, how to enable the second person who responds to
that mail/paragraph to add more stuff and make it a thread on its own...



&gt;<i> I see the value in the proposed structure, but if you do not &quot;design&quot; the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system in a way that gently picks people up, they wont use it, because it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs to much discipline
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, Can you suggest specific solutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

It's not easy. I believe, the current &quot;mainstream way&quot; is the same way i
use right now, while answering to your mail. I pick a paragraph (couple of
sentences) and respond to those).
This respose might include questions, external linked to sources, counter
proposals, up/down votes (emotional statements), and so on....
If a straigthforward way would exist, then there would be no challange...
So i believe, the question is, how to manipulate/change the way people
respond to what is presented to them.
With email (which 1/5 of people on the internet use every day), its done in
a similar way like i do right now... so how could a system support it, so
that my response to your email will automatically get parsed into a more
structured, or highly structured form?
What did you write? What did i respond? The quoted paragraph i respond in
these lines is 40 words long and actually 32 words were content of a former
reply of mine and only 8 words came from you.
Do i ask questions? ... no.
Do i quote external sources? ...no.
So what exactly is the category, this reply would go into? ...normaly its
not, but this time its some kind of &quot;meta category&quot;...
Whats my intentions? Whats my needs? What do i want to accomplish? Is it
possible to give me a button or several to &quot;relax/remedy&quot; my needs?
If there were a software supported way, would it help me to not write so
many lines? :-)
Or at least cut down on it? (actually theres some questions in this reply)
