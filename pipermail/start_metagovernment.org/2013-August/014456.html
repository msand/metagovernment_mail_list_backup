<PRE>&gt;<i> Because the matters that have been opened are so fundamental (even partly
</I>&gt;<i> below awareness), it may take some work to articulate them clearly and
</I>&gt;<i> agree on the articulation. Also, it will probably be best to tackle them
</I>&gt;<i> one at a time. Let us start with: &quot;What is our business?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I dont get your question, whose business?




------------------------------**------------------------------**------------
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; I dont know your definition of corporation, but democracy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    mainly happens on the street through spending money or not on
</I>&gt;<i>    certain things, and it happens every day during work time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Metagovernment community is now on the way to becoming a non-profit
</I>&gt;<i> startup. The startup will be in the business of attracting donations and
</I>&gt;<i> then spending that money to design, develop and deploy democratic decision
</I>&gt;<i> systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

This approach is ok, but not as good as it could be. It would be better, if
it would not need donations and had a valid business model instead. Maybe
not metagovernment itself, but its projects. It might be more healthy to
actually be self sustained.




&gt;<i> You and I and the other members of the Metagovernment community are
</I>&gt;<i> already part of that startup. We have equity in the startup by virtue of
</I>&gt;<i> our participation -- which is just the way you want it to be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

No its not. I want it to be hardcoded into numbers. Right now, it all
depends on the good will of people around here. But maybe currently not
much is involved. If a metagovernment project will gain real influence
because its used by many people and if donations will start to come in,
this will change. So will everyone have something to say about that? Could
i bring it to a court? do i have a veto? what if someone new joins? will he
immediately have the same rights as Michael Allen?
Currently all this is fuzzy and we dont need to think about bringing some
issues to a court and fight about it, but its only because there is no big
steak to fight about yet. ....it will change and even if those who are
currently arround would never fight about it, new people might pop up who
will only come because they think there is something that could be grabbed
....




&gt;<i> If we ourselves (Metagovernment) are unable to agree upon a full direct
</I>&gt;<i> democratic decision system design through which we ourselves can then make
</I>&gt;<i> decisions in operating our own startup, then &quot;they&quot; (anyone outside of our
</I>&gt;<i> own community) would be silly to suppose that we have any special expertise
</I>&gt;<i> that would help &quot;them&quot; to make decisions democratically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

yes, and i have said that in the past. I believe, that metagovernment or
even single projects have to use their own software to organize themselves.
for example: i've pointed out, that VOTOROLA should use their system to
distribute work between developers and other people involved in the
votorola project. they should use it to inform all people who are involved
with the votorola project. they should use it to delegate work.
after all: one feature of votorola is to create an issue and let people
pool together ressources (one of them might be votes) to realize a
project.... votorola itself is not different in that regard, so its all
about &quot;eat ur own dogfood&quot;.

same goes with metagov. metagov vision, metagov goals, staying informed
about metagov projects, putting in some personal ressources (may it be
money, time, expertise, whatever...)
all people around here do it for idealistic reasons, but if it should
become a mainstream thing in the future, it has to work with total egoists
too, therefore it MUST support a system that could be used, so that
everyone could bring issues to a court to have their rights enforced.

But that needs to be based on CONTRACT LAW. Every action u do within a
software system needs to be grounded in contract law and information be
presented in a way, that it could easily be used to convince a court. it
has to be unambiguous.



We need to &quot;dine on our own dogfood&quot; as proof-of-concept that we know what
&gt;<i> we are talking about, so that when we approach others outside of our
</I>&gt;<i> community for donations or as prospective users of our systems, they won't
</I>&gt;<i> just laugh at us (e.g., &quot;let me know when they finish playing in the
</I>&gt;<i> sandbox&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

yes, true.
if metagovernment would really would like to go down that road, then there
needs to be a project that actually starts small, with a cross-plattform
webapp, that can be used on a mobile phone too. the features and direction
in which this software will be developed has to be decided in a &quot;democratic
process&quot; by metagovernment people manually, until its possible by using the
tool itself to decide upon which road to walk down.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    You say: &quot;a job is where democracy happens&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I say, right here right now is where democracy happens, between you and I,
</I>&gt;<i> in this discourse. (This is our work environment -- yours and mine.) In
</I>&gt;<i> each instance that we (you and I) succeed in reaching agreement, we have
</I>&gt;<i> taken one more small step toward full global direct democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
YES, BUT ... :-)
We have to generalize it, which means, even though we talk about creating a
method for other &quot;work collectives&quot; (may it be companies or whatever) to
organize themselves in a democratic fashion, we still have to classify what
we are doing in &quot;business vocabulary&quot;.

So maybe, what we are doing involves multiple &quot;business domains&quot;.
We discuss our target groups (it might be companies or families or ngo's or
a municipality or whatever)
We discuss how to approach stuff (maybe that falls under &quot;strategic
management&quot;)

Its vital to translate all aspects of a plattform people could use into
&quot;business vocabulary&quot;, because thats what people at work will understand,
you could even give new meaning or at least twist the existing meaning
to/of some &quot;business vocabulary&quot; if people learn about the vocabulary
through usage of the software system.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    You say: &quot;The work people do every day is what they have insight
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    into and what they are familiar with.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The work that you and I do every day has to do with conceiving and
</I>&gt;<i> designing and discussing democratic decision systems. That is what we (you
</I>&gt;<i> and I) have insight into and what we are familiar with. We need to help
</I>&gt;<i> *ourselves* argue about it and make *ourselves* owners of our personal work
</I>&gt;<i> environment.
</I>

Actually, i'm doing it in my spare time. I'm studying computer science and
business administration and currently doing an internship as an
entrepreneur in residence and i'm a web developer too (i use
javascript/html5/css3/nodejs).
i'm writing my thesis about the financial crisis and the rules of money and
equity.

I'd like to found my own company, but a company but i want it to be
organized in a way which is p2p grass roots democracy and it should be
scalable too, and it should be easy to co-operate with other companies who
use the same approach, eventually blurring the borders between the
co-operating companies. It should be more about the people involved in that
then about the companies as abstract artificial entities...

There should also be some kind of &quot;interface&quot; that would enable those
p2p-companies to work together with existing companies and maybe influence
those to change their way to work too (but that will probably depend on how
successful those p2p-companies will be in general)


Then maybe our own self esteem will increase, and we may feel comfortable
&gt;<i> enough to tackle the next layer in the hierarchy in a democratic fashion.
</I>&gt;<i> Our own work together (you and I) will then grow bottom up and so will the
</I>&gt;<i> tools THAT WE OURSELVES USE, in doing our own work together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    You say: &quot;Its easier to create a tool and make people use it, when
</I>&gt;<i>    you start with a startup or a project team and make it work&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are a startup. We (self-selected members of the Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> community) have equity in that startup. We can start with us. We can start
</I>&gt;<i> with us NOW.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

yes, i know. we are and i still believe we should do exactly that, &quot;eat our
own dogfood&quot; and if its not possible, because we have some requirements
which are not supported by the metagov projects yet, we have to add those
features.
This will also create a &quot;focus&quot; on those features which are really needed.
And if metagovernment would earn money on their own, the software would be
more similar to something a classical company could use to organize itself.

Donations are a &quot;nice to have&quot; thing, but i believe, the tools developed by
metagov should aim to be self-sustained.

Question: If metagov people put effort into a software which can and will
be used by other people, so that they can organize their work and &quot;make
money&quot; from it, part of their success will be because it was in part
enabled because of the metagov software that company used.


We (you and I and other community members) begin by reaching agreements,
&gt;<i> one after another after another, as quickly and efficiently as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> (The aim is not to aimlessly, endlessly chatter. The aim is to reach
</I>&gt;<i> agreements, one after another after another, as quickly and efficiently as
</I>&gt;<i> possible. Our progress is measured by the quality and quantity of that
</I>&gt;<i> growing corpus of agreements.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

yes. and depending on the issue, its easier if there is a software that
supports this.
there is software which helps with finding a good date/time for a meeting (
doodle.com).
If we would chat about it on this email list, it would take longer.
For all kinds of business issues there might be features of the software,
so that all those who are involved in the issue or interested in it, can
quickly reach consensus.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, we don't have any special tools. We have only listserv
</I>&gt;<i> emails and wiki-pages. But even just those tools are sufficient to enable
</I>&gt;<i> us to work toward growing our corpus of agreements. We just need to focus
</I>&gt;<i> on our business: making proposals and reaching agreements. That is the
</I>&gt;<i> business of our startup. That is what we produce, and what we will be
</I>&gt;<i> helping others produce.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you agree? (Shall we start making proposals with the aim of reaching
</I>&gt;<i> agreements?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes. i dont know how to start a metagovernment process. there is a problem
with all of this:
1. developers want to develop the way they think is the best one
2. non-developers have ideas too but cannot code
3. driving developer effort into community decided features that developers
might not be convinced of, will need developers to be paid in some way
(shares/money/something else)

Or to put it more generally in a way that might not be too popular on this
mailinglist:
1. Someone who puts lots of effort into metagovernment for several years
vs.
2. Someone who just joined the mailinglist recently and starts to talk a lot

Will their &quot;votes&quot; both have the same weight? ...like maybe on real issues.
suppose there is already donations to metagovernment or people should
invest their own work/time/ressources into something. why should they? what
about free riders?
There is so many problems which exist because there is no mechanism that
can reward those who do stuff. how to assess what people do? who should
asses it and in which way?
how to share any cake that might get created? will everyone get the same no
matter how much effort he or she has put into something? will there be
shares? will someone decide upon a &quot;wage&quot;? will all decide? will it become
beaurocratic???

i believe we have to discuss this issue and decide upon it in order to make
outcome more predictable. *Assume i put in 40hours a week or 60hours a week
into metagovernment.
i would have to be a very rich person, because otherwise, how would i pay
my bills?*
Even if i believe in the metagovernment vision, how can i ever put in all
my effort into it?
Currently, those who do put effort into it have to &quot;write it off&quot;
immediately and need to be intrinsically motivated all the way and do it
for idealistic reasons and a kind of hope, that one day the effort might
make a difference....

...but only very few people can operate this way, most people (mainstream)
will never do it and some of them (with very egocentric tendencies) might
even frown upon it.

The metagovernment vision is way to important to put it on such a sandily
foundation.
But in order to change that, without corrupting the vision, we have to
decide upon a mechanism of how &quot;the cake is shared&quot;.
Manye on this list might avoid this question as good as they can, but this
must be solved if it should ever be successful.

Some startups grow from 0 to 500 workers in under a year and set new trends
that revolutionize a certain domain of life for a certain &quot;target group&quot; of
customers.

Put it differently:
Why can 500 freelancers not &quot;over night&quot; create something that could
&quot;compete&quot; with a company with 500 workers? Its both 500 skilled people, but
the degree of organization (network of processes) is much better within the
company, i believe thats the main reason.

how to enable people to set up complex work processes on the fly to
efficiently produce resulst? people need to pay bills, people only can
spend their time ONCE!

this issue is not tackled by metagovernment, but i feel its vital and needs
to be solved!
Everything else will fall in place if this issue is solved, because its
possible to center all features of a software around this foundation, but
its avoided.

That needs to be changed!!! :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Hi Paul and Alex,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Paul, thanks for the link to the CESJ material -- good stuff!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Alex, I very much agree with you that social arrangements that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     maintain and increase concentration of wealth/power are problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to be solved.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     To the extent that a particular corporation &quot;succeeds&quot; (from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     perspective of its owners), wealth/power are concentrated (in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     corporation, and in the owners of the corporation). This is not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     problem from the perspective of the corporation, but is a problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     from the perspective of the rest of humanity, and nature, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     future generations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I don't quite understand what leads you think that tinkering with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the rules of equity (within corporations) will solve the problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that corporations keep causing for the world as a whole (poverty,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     war, environmental destruction, etc.). Each corporation will still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     be narrowly pursuing its own interests, with the rest of us having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     no choice but to continue trusting &quot;The Invisible Hand&quot; to protect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the rest of us from corporate predations. (We have been trusting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The Invisible Hand for the last few hundred years, and things have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     not been going so well ...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Its difficult to answer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is &quot;the invisible hand&quot;? This is to fuzzy to me to really respond.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If people do nothing, contracts or equity rules will first make those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without equity suffer,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because the shareholders will squeeze them out to reduce &quot;variable costs&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At some point in time, the money system will take over, because existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contracts, mainly serving liabilities has precedence over serving equity,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the shareholders will be squeezed out in favor of the money owners....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (think my english is not that good, but hope u can follow the thought)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some corporations can go without debt, but only because other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corporations or the government or private households are loaded with that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debt instead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no having any debt as a corporation is not a solution that could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applied by the average corporation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...but then again, i think its a waste of time to argue about money or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complain about money, because in my view, the only lever which exists that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be potentially used to tackle money, is equity :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You already summarized my idea in a couple of bullet points.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could you be more precise of what u dont understand? Maybe its easier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then for me to respond more specifically.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; I think, because people are not used to this, it's not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     easy to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        sell the idea and people will be very sceptical in the beginning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It is pretty easy to predict that the people who will most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     skeptical will be the richest people in the world. Any particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     startup can indeed choose to &quot;spread the wealth&quot; internally, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     then the richest people will back competitors to the startup that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     give them better equity deals, and will instruct their captured
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     politicians and regulators to make trouble for any startup that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     presumes to try to &quot;spread the wealth&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wasnt talking about the rich people with lots of power. I was talking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the average worker. They will be very sceptical in the beginning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You are right, that those people who own so much right now might be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sceptical too, and maybe with good reason, but maybe they will even support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it, because they themselves are trapped in the rules of the system. Some of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them might know, some or most of them might not know.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     As Paul suggested, &quot;binary economics&quot; presents arrangements that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     are very close to what you are suggesting. The CESJ organization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (that has been promulgating binary economics) has been in business
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     since 1984, as yet without much success (you and I had never even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     heard of them). If you want &quot;real effects NOW&quot;, starting with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     trying to change the rules of equity within corporations may not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     be the best choice. The attempt would be unlikely to succeed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     against the opposition of the richest people in the world, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     even if it did succeed, the world would still be at the mercy of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     successful corporations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. I see no other way, even if what i propose isnt easy to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. What a corporation is, will change with those new rules established
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Rich people have no way of opposing, because talent will be attracted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the new way, all you have to do is provide the rules which enable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;working together efficiently&quot; while having greater benefits than working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a traditional corporation. (benefits mean: earn more money, have more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power (because of shares))
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; But there's also the problems of how people will decide,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        because if there is many shareholders, the problem of how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        establish good democratic pratices supported by the proper tools,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        follows immediately.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     YES! My view is that in order to really solve &quot;the problems of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     concentrated power&quot;, we need to create, demonstrate, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     popularize a full direct democracy, that is capable of rendering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     corporations obsolete, globally. (Because people are not used to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     this, it's not easy to sell the idea and people will be very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     skeptical in the beginning ...) :^)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> YES! ..and NO! :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;popularize a full direct democry&quot; ... YES!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;capable of rendering corporations obsolete&quot; ....WHAT? :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I dont know your definition of corporation, but democracy mainly happens
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the street through spending money or not on certain things, and it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happens every day during work time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you do what your boss tells you to do and if you are a &quot;good worker&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then ur boss might give u a bit more power, so u can tell other people what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The good thing with this is, that there is a tendency that those in power
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make better and more &quot;grown up&quot; decisions than those not in power, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they will be only brought into power if they seem to understand what they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are doing, but on the other hand, they also act in their own best interest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and maybe their bosses interest  and those who dont do will not be brought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into power.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if u really want people to experience DIRECT DEMOCRACY, bring it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> money (i believe thats currently not possible yet) and bring it to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 40hours of work u do every week.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thats where people experience democracy and thats where they can start to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grow up until they eventually end up in washington ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, workers, through equity, get control of their work environment and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they have to collaborate with their coworkers which then will be coowners.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then they start to take over the supply chains, that means democratic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corporations will work together... then they will clim up further, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every times its all the average people and their 40h work. they will not be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workers anymore, they will be owners or co-owners. ..p2p-owners?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So you do not build DIRECT DEMOCRACY as an architecture designed by some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smart academics as a system and a software which then will be brought upon

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Hi Alex,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             It seems that you have the makings for starting a startup: a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;founder team&quot; that offers the service of setting up other new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             startups in the manner you suggest. The success of those other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             startups that used your arrangements and practices would then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             provide validation of the arrangements and practices, at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             from the perspective of each startup (though not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         necessarily from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             the perspective of society as a whole, or nature, or future
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             generations).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             I went through what you wrote and tried to pick out the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             that you are trying to solve. Here is what I came up with:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 * The richest keep becoming richer because they can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         sit back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   and let the structure work for them once they have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         invested.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 * To not let them sit back, there needs to be a &quot;social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   process&quot; within the startup of constantly evaluating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         results
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   to measure progress.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 * Given such an internal process, it is then possible to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   arrange that shares can &quot;waste away&quot; if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         shareholder is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   not continually doing work to help the startup.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 * This would in turn enable everyone in the startup to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   shareholder (creating and maintaining shareholdings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   working), so that compensation would be in the form of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   dividend paid to shares held, rather than in the form of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   wages or salaries.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 * In such a system, the richest (initial investors)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         would no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   longer have a free ride forever after the initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   investment, which would be fairer, and would over time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   spread wealth away from the richest toward those who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                   actually do the work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Have I correctly understood the essence of what you are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         trying to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             accomplish?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 with a process, where a digital business model canvas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             can give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 transparencey to all participants about the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             state of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 company. Combined with the Planning Poker Approach,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             its possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 to measure progress or do some kind of bookkeeping or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 system, where you measure how much all your points are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             worth and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 after each iteration you could reevaluate in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             retrospective to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 what degree your assumptions became true and this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             practice will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 sharpen everyones ability to make such guesses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             (learning process).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 Now if you also account for depreciation (some todo's,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 results of &quot;a customer interview&quot; or &quot;cleaning a room&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 depreciate faster than a bought &quot;office table&quot;), you could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 calculate an average rate of depreciation with which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             earned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 points waste away.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 Then there is also those points who have to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;written off&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 after you did some kind of work which turned out to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             a waste of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 time.... ...but the process of this is weaved into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             CORE
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 TECHNIQUE (with business model canvas) around which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             you build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 everything else and which helps you to keep focus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 *What does it mean? And how is this related to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;STATUS QUO&quot;?*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 1. Now, what if i buy an office chair and give it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;points&quot; during
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 a weekly planning poker session? The &quot;office chair&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             also has a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 value in &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot;. If many companies will do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             this approach,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 you essentially get an &quot;exchange rate&quot; between your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             companies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 internal point system and &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot; and the like.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 2. What if this process works well, why not make these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             points
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 REAL SHARES? And if you do so, why not make everyones
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             SHARES
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 waste away with the average rate of depreciation, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             that people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 have to re-invest, in order to not lose all their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             shares over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 time? (=&gt; This will essentially make all this equity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             agreements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 or &quot;VESTING&quot; rules kind of superfluous, because if someone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 decides to quit and doesnt want to sell his shares,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             they will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 waste away over time)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 Why should I invest work in earning shares if they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             waste away???
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 Because as long as you have shares, they decide on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             potentially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 &quot;real time basis&quot; how much of the companies revenue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             (in USD or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 EUR or the like...) goes into your pocket. So you dont
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             work for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 wage, but for those points which eventually are shares
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             and which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 will decide your monetary income flow (potentially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             minutely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 dividends)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 IF this techniques, which in practice should make the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             average
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 person better off, becomes mainstream practice (which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             is totally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 possible, because if there are role models who work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             this way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 successfully, it will spread virally, because it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             mean more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 money and more power with less work for everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             beside the top
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 1%, but it has to start bottom-up and success of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             practicioners
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 will automatically spread it and make it a mainstream
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             practice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 ... THEN: shareholders will lose equity over time to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             those who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 are actively doing the work, which makes the rules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             fair again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 And because everyone or every company will create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             their &quot;point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 system&quot; which will end up having an exchange rate in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             EUR/USD,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 they all get used to this and it will or might lay a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             foundation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 to tackle the monetary system as such, but for now,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 totally of reach.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                         Equity gives you votes in the context of your

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                         I came to the conclusion, that the rules/laws

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                         money are broken and so are the rules around

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                         Do you know the forbes magazine and their

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                         The other way would be to get into the financial

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                         would abuse broken money laws.
