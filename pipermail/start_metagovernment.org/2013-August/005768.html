<PRE>Hey folks,

Name's Daniel. Long time follower on this list though shamingly never managed to get involved.

I'd like to propose a plan of action that could potentially cover the
issues that have surfaced lately regarding the mailing list, overall
decision-making and actually making progress.

First, I suggest we transition our discussions to a forum-like
platform. The mailing list would remain active and posts on the forum
would all be published as individual messages on the ML. The handling
of posts to the ML is slightly more complicated and depends (initially
at least) on the set of modules that are available for the forum
software. Parsing mail content especially when trying to correlate with
upstream messages and trying to identify and extract user content,
quotes, formatting, etc. is not an easy feat (I've been there). A
solution that is much more affordable to start with would be to enhance
the messages by embedding links for the various actions (view details,
reply, +1, etc.). That way we can focus on the correctness of a
reference implementation as a web platform and later start pushing
features down other channels (email, mobile, voice, etc.).

With almost no extra effort, the forum can at least allow us to create
some structure by segmenting the conversations across categories and
topics and by providing a threaded view in the web interface.

Second, well ... we'd have what I believe would be a minimally viable
platform for experimentation. A platform that would actually be *in
use* since our &quot;real&quot; discussions would be conducted on it. Through
small increments and iterations, we can move towards a rich discourse /
debate / collaborative reasoning platform :

- Integration with a wiki / publishing platform
- Argumentation
- Decision formalization
- Integration with external e-gov tools and platforms
- Integration with a ticket-like system for the delegation of tasks
- Identity management (SSO, reward system, karma, membership certification - badges, privacy, etc.)

All of these things could be done separately but in our case, I believe
two conditions are necessary to actually set things in motion :

- Build and contribute to something that is in *real use*. If we can
manage to eat our own dog food, not only will it taste sweeter for
those who produce it but I'm positive we'll have even more success
selling it.

- Build a free discussion and informal communication platform and make
it the foundation for any other system. Collaborative governance
ultimately is all about building a model for transitioning from
INFORMAL to FORMAL, be it ideas, statements, arguments, decisions,
action plans, etc. It all starts with an informal discussion even at
the highest levels of formalism (how would you go about proposing a
change in the constitution if not by first expressing your thoughts
with your own words in an informal context ?).

Let me know what you think about all this and if we can settle on a course of action, I can start working on a migration plan.

Daniel
