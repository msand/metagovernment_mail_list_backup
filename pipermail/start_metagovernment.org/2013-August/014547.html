</I>&gt;<i> Let me try to explain, Alex.  Then let's come back to your suggestion

</I>&gt;<i> My explanation has two parts, plus a little magic in between; the

</I>&gt;<i> (1) Suppose people are out there discussing some topic like they

</I>&gt;<i> they're informal and messy.  Suddenly there appears on the internet

</I>&gt;<i> summary at all (picture the best you can imagine).  It just pops into
</I>&gt;<i> existence in a remote corner of the internet, and there it is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
nice :-)


(2) A few of the scattered, informal participants notice the summary.
&gt;<i> They discover that it's helpful to them in their discussions.  They
</I>&gt;<i> just have to look at it and it helps them (magic).  Most don't notice
</I>&gt;<i> the summary at all, at least not immediately.  But they feel its
</I>&gt;<i> effects all the same (magic) and again those effects are helpful.  The
</I>&gt;<i> discussion begins to improve overall in quality, breadth and depth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
cool :-)


That's the basic idea.  The crucial thing to notice is that it begins
&gt;<i> in informal discussion, and ends in informal discussion.  The formal
</I>&gt;<i> stuff in between (magic) is unimportant in itself.  See what I mean?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

sounds like a broad vision and for those people who discuss a topic or who
are influenced in a good way by the effects of such a system, its awesome.
one could argue, that we already have such a system in place, and its
called the internet.
people find stuff through search engines and the like and often its useful
for their local discussions (i believe the internet has already improved
quality of regulars tables in local pubs)

So what exactly is it, which does not exist yet? The internet exists,
blogs, search engines, email, forum, wiki, .... ...exist :-)

I think what you have just described is a &quot;picture&quot; or &quot;vision&quot; which can
me refined, but beside that, could be used to GUIDE progress. But, although
its important to have that super broad vision of what the future could look
like in order to be guided in the right direction, when everything else
seems to be foggy and not clear, there is the need to start with a first
step and then a second after the first, and so on... towards the vision :-)

Because there is so many tools and concepts out there toying around with
different methods and each TOOL could be transformed into ANY OTHER TOOL,
given enough effort, its really not that important to have some kind of
&quot;perfect methodology&quot; to implement with the first tool, because it will
evolve anyway.

The vision on the other hand is vital, because it guides the &quot;evolution&quot; :-)

And the reason i proposed to start with &quot;email&quot;, although its a bit harder
than other technologies, is that... even though its not that easy to build
all the nice features into it like you could do with an &quot;standalone *put in
your favorite tech here* app&quot;, it is where all the users are.

And in order for people to move in one direction, no matter what that
direction would be, they have to start with a first step into that
direction, starting from WHERE THEY ARE !!!! ...and that is email.

1/5th of all online activity is email, the other 4/5 is something else, but
those 4/5 are different for each group of users, but the 1/5 (email) is the
same for ALL OF THEM :-)

And even though the pirate party (a party born in the web) and with
organizations like.. US!!! (metagovernment), ...we still use EMAIL as our
main method of communication.
Sure, sometimes there is skype, sometimes the wiki, sometimes we &quot;play
around&quot; with tools, sometimes we use a forum, but in the end, we all come
back to the mailinglist.

If new people join, they join the mailinglist first.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT? Whats it with the &quot;mailinglist&quot; that makes it &quot;so
special&quot;?
Could it be, that its so easy to integrate in your daily routine to check
your emails?
What else is it?
Is it possible to enhance email?
What would be the first step, one would have to take towards YOUR VISION,
if one had to start from where one is currently based (EMAIL). :-P

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Probably, there are many ways in which things could be done and many
</I>&gt;<i> tools
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that could be used. So i already think that blinap or self-governing
</I>&gt;<i> public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mirrors are over-analyzed. ...lots of theory crafting. If we had a
</I>&gt;<i> working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prototype that wouldnt need people to OPT IN, but would come to people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automatically and they have to OPT OUT (ex. using email as a technology),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then some questions could be easily answered by just observing what
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will do :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...no need to think stuff through and to make assumptions, just let them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use it and observe.
