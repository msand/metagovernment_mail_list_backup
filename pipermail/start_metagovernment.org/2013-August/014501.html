<PRE>Hi Alex,

This thread now has way too many different topics in it. (And boy do we 
need better software to support our discussions ... talk about runaway 
complexity!)

So, I am going to spin off some new threads to address some of the new 
topics that you have raised in your latest two emails, and suggest to Ed 
and Harry and Paul and you and others that they do the same, whenever 
possible. Let us try to have each thread start with a single proposal 
that is as &quot;unbundled&quot; as possible and in &quot;elevator pitch&quot; form, and 
then have that thread contain the discussion of that proposal, with new 
spin-off threads created whenever possible, to try to keep each 
particular thread as focused as possible, and to facilitate the aim of 
trying to actually decide things occasionally.
