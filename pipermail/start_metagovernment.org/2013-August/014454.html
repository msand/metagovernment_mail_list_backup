yes.

yes, somehow...



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tinkering with currency design has one big advantage that in my opinion

thats what it does for centuries


&gt;<i> and slowly gain importance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
and it never gained any importance at all...




&gt;<i> It does not require a broad consensus to have an influence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
who cares for some influence in academia, that doesnt change a thing and
its impossible to convince those who will not &quot;profit&quot; from a change
(mainstream &quot;neoclassical&quot; economists cannot be convinced. the different
&quot;monetary schools&quot; in academia battle over this questions for decades if
not even centuries...)



&gt;<i> In fact a succesful attempt would force an important change on the world's
</I>&gt;<i> population without giving them a say in the matter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
nope, probably not. thing do not change because some people in academia
discuss stuff, they only change because people act on something an actually
DO STUFF :-)
all theory that needs to be known about this issues is already known. there
is many people in academia in different times which said all u need to
know. the problem lies in how to start implementing stuff, because it will
never happen in a top down approach.



&gt;<i> I realise this but there's little that can be done. A modern successful
</I>&gt;<i> currency design change would have a viral effect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
no, it wont. there is already many alternative currency designs out there
and their representatives fight over the details, but in the end this is
not important and not a topic people are interested in, because its too
complex for most people to be interested in this topic. its just too
abstract. it will never get viral because of a concept as such.
Bitcoin has gone viral to some degree, because bitcoin evangelists actually
implemented and spread stuff. bitcoin works right now and it works in the
whole world.

Its lots of hard work and many people who are actively involved in the
bitcoin economy and who work hard to spread the word. in order to have
synergetic effects, try to wrap ur head around bitcoin and think about how
extend bitcoins with concepts like those u mentioned in the beginning, that
maybe could have an effect, but even then, its hard.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Wouldn't it make sense to use a point system to where if you got too many

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you know the stress human beings endure over the legal system?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Mark,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Ultimately, you appear to be making a set of empirical claims
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> regarding money. As such, the claims are open to empirical (experimental)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> test, and potentially to falsification. Yes? (If the claims are not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> testable and potentially falsifiable, then they may fall into the category
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of quasi-religious belief -- immune to reason and discourse. If so, then
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there is nothing useful that can be said in response, and discussion would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be a waste of time and effort.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I am open to the possibility that there may exist one or more scalable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> social system designs (that do not feature money) that would work out
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;better&quot; than the various scalable social system designs that have been
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implemented up to this point on planet earth (that have featured money).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Show me your design -- propose it. I would very much like to see it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Without having yet seen your design, and therefore speaking
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> abstractly, my view is that you are &quot;throwing the baby out with the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> bathwater&quot;. We use money as a medium for transmitting energy, just as we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use electricity as a medium for transmitting energy. I do not see money as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> being inevitably a root of enslavement and corruption, any more than I see
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> electricity as being inevitably a root of enslavement and corruption.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I have written out a series of proposals concerning money here:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a">http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps you can use my proposals as foils in articulating your
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> corresponding, competing proposals. And also, I will be interested to read
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any direct responses to my &quot;money proposals&quot; that you may have.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with you that, in designing our new social system, we want the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> design to forestall and mitigate corruption so far as possible, and to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> eliminate slavery entirely. If you can show me a social system design that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> does not feature money, and that can scale to the level of the global
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> population, and that accomplishes those design aims (no slavery, not much
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> corruption), you will definitely have my attention.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
