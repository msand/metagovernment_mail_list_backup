<PRE>Dear Bentley,

You mistake my intentions.  I'm not interested in holding up your
experiment.  And I have no competing shindig of my own to promote.

I don't know whether to reply to your counter arguments below.  If you
feel it'd be better to just drop the matter, then I'm okay with that.

Best wishes,

Mike

&gt;<i> Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> It is possible for someone to try and manipulate any system. These new
</I>&gt;<i> systems were specifically designed to mitigate abuses found in voting and
</I>&gt;<i> in unstructured discussion. Finding one possible abuse of a new design does
</I>&gt;<i> not outweigh all the other benefits especially when the other options
</I>&gt;<i> available today suffer from the same abuse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You were very vague about how you expect us to go about &quot;rational
</I>&gt;<i> discourse&quot;. Please suggest a specific process or system or tool to
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate it so we can weigh everything out in the open? We are
</I>&gt;<i> theoretically using rational discourse right now but I see many
</I>&gt;<i> (unintentional) abuses in attempting to persuade people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not see any inherent reason why decision assisting tools would
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily be &quot;media of brute force&quot;. A calculator that helps my family
</I>&gt;<i> agree on which house to buy is not brute force. A pro con list to help a
</I>&gt;<i> group see all the information without resorting to faulty memory is not
</I>&gt;<i> brute force. Do not assume that other people's systems will suffer from
</I>&gt;<i> your lack of imagination.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We were not arguing about whether it was better to use a forum or email. We
</I>&gt;<i> were debating if using anything other than email has any merit to try. It
</I>&gt;<i> was mostly an experiment in consensus building over a trivial subject. It
</I>&gt;<i> failed miserably but I learned a lot from it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned,
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your encouragement. I have been distracted by the other posts
</I>&gt;<i> but I do want to get together and try out the current tools to see what we
</I>&gt;<i> can learn and bring back to this group (if they want it). The list you have
</I>&gt;<i> so far is great and it might be good to do a quick search for other
</I>&gt;<i> existing tools. .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> Ned and I may be experimenting with existing tools to see what is out there
</I>&gt;<i> to assist in building consensus. It looks like others have done this in the
</I>&gt;<i> past so any suggested tools or systems would be appreciated. We also would
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate anyone that would like to join this journey.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On a different note, I am disappointed in the number of people trying to
</I>&gt;<i> persuade others not to try an experiment in favor of their own idea without
</I>&gt;<i> community intervention. Has this community chosen a tone of discouraging
</I>&gt;<i> experimentation and innovation?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can't we try most of these experiments? I am available to use my skills to
</I>&gt;<i> prototype any idea that can be expressed specifically enough to be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented. So far a majority of the conversation has been spent saying
</I>&gt;<i> why a specific idea would not work. I feel it would be more effective to
</I>&gt;<i> actually try the ideas out instead of assuming we already know everything.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Frustratedly,
</I>&gt;<i>
