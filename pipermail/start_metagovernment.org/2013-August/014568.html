This has been attempted here before, and the technology was found lacking. Is there now a tool that could do that? When we looked before, it was surprisingly difficult to even approach the topic. Then assuming we found a technological solution, there arise a lot of technical issues with issue tracking.

Yes, we are still on A Small Orange, and bumping up against its very stringent storage limits. I liked Tux because its mission aligns with ours (ie, it's along the principles of the FOSS community), but their interface and capabilities are very restricting, and I would like to avoid it. I would like to move us to a different host and eventually get ownership out of my sole possession, but so far have not hit on a specific course of action.

I'd also like to open out more services than just the wiki. We had perviously decided to start a multi-contributor blog that would enable a different form of outreach; it just hasn't materialized yet. Having other experimental platforms running on metagov services also would make perfect sense. That's what it's here for. (And PS, I'm still working on the longer-term plan of spinning up a company which can intake funds to distribute out to metagov projects.)
