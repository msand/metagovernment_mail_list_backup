<PRE>Sorry, wont work, waste of time.

There is zillions of apps/&quot;websites&quot;/stuff that build an &quot;island&quot; where you
could &quot;register&quot; and start discussing/voting. It wont NEVER take off. You
have to start a journey from where you/we are now. you cannot start from
the moon if you are currently earth based.

Mailinglists and Emails is the de-facto standard for communication.
There might be &quot;large islands&quot;, like twitter and/or facebook, and
eventually a few other ones, but when it comes to proposal/discussion apps
or whatever you propose, it just doesnt work.
It's all email, even when it comes to US :-) There is a wiki, there is an
IRC chat, we have a facebook page, we even KNOW lots of tools that offer
making proposals or voting on subjects, but in the end, what do we do?
WE USE EMAIL !!!!! Its all about the mailinglist :-) And we try to manually
structure the threads.
The pirate party uses mailinglists too and submailinglists and they use
whats called a &quot;sync forum&quot; to synchronize the mailinglist with a forum, so
you could choose if you want to use the forum or the mailinglist.

I think it might be possible to improve this further.


@You proposal &amp; <A HREF="http://allangles.co">http://allangles.co</A>
It's &quot;a nice idea&quot;, but the concept can be implemented in countless
variants with countless different visualizations. But it will NEVER work,
...not because its not useful in principle, but because its not where
people are. Suppose it would scale and so forth....
... it's just nor where people are. In order to take off, people have to
change their habits &quot;over night&quot; and not only ONE person, but many have to
use this plattform and use it time after time, so they have to integrate it
into their daily routine.... ...another tool in the endless lists of tools
(and probably they have to &quot;sign up&quot; too)

It's not going to work. There's so many startups offering &quot;useful&quot; services
and they try to avoid registration or allow it to use facebook or twitter
or google or github authentification, so users dont have to do it twice.

What do people use? EMAIL... and email is even more widespread than
facebook or twitter.
Its at the heart of online communication and there's virtually nobody who
uses the web that doesnt have an email account. Its a basic requirement to
signup on twitter or facebook for example.
They use it, we use it, its everywhere and it wont go away any time soon
and maybe never. So it just sits around and is waiting to evolve. Its where
people are. So a tool that wants to be successful should probably start
there.

If its &quot;easy to set up&quot; or if it's &quot;easy to use&quot; (maybe an open source
mailinglist server software that anyone could easily set up and use, and a
hosted service for those who dont want to set it up on their own)

So start with what email has today and then &quot;bolt on&quot; additional concepts.

I believe everything else is a waste of time and has been done way to often.

How about a prototype website instead of using email or plugins. I think I
could work something up quickly. Would someone put together a short
requirement list like:

   - A User can enter an issue
   - Users can create proposals to solve the issue
   - Users can create objections to the proposals
   - Objections are voted on? (I'm a little lost here)

I would prefer a system that has no voting at all. I have a prototype of a
way to decide if a proposal should succeed that does not use voting.
Instead of voting people add reasons for or against passage of the
proposal. Each statement for or against can also be affected by statements
for or against it in a hierarchy. An objection could be made against the
proposal but then other people could object to the objection, for example,
by adding a statement that the objection is a logical fallacy. The system
weighs all the pros and cons and displays the confidence in the proposal
(and all the objections). I feel this is an example of a way to handle
objections without voting.

You can see an example at <A HREF="http://AllAngles.co/13">http://AllAngles.co/13</A>

I look forward to seeing where the conversation goes.
