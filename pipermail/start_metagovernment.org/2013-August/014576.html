&gt;<i> By asking people to separate their sentences into distinct concepts and separate justifications a system could allow others to comment on a specific point or justification more easily and visually. You could possible still include multiple points and justification in a single post. You could then still do all you outlined above with a smaller change to the way people do it. We might allow people to highlight a set of text and comment on that group. The challenge is how to visually represent it in an understandable way.

It's worth noting here that Candiwi was developed with just that idea in mind. In it, each sentence was a distinct object which could be commented on and/or voted on.

It is a wiki, not email, but there may be opportunity for adoption of some of its code in some way. Unfortunately, it looks like Manuel/Fabe have taken down the host, but the source is still available:

Also, I believe the Votorola Difference Bridge serves a somewhat similar purpose (and again, is wiki-style... I think, though perhaps it can work on email archives). It allows two proposals (etc.) to be compared, and then for people to accept individual parts of them. Not sure if commenting is in there though. Michael or conseo could speak more on that, if they happen to be listening. Ah, I did find Michael's documentation on it:
