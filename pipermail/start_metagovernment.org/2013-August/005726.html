<PRE>
I do apologize for such a brief summary, and I you could have worded your response to invite more dialog rather than tending to cut it off.

First, this is talking about currencies, which is a much broader topic than money.  The biggest problem in the world today is scarce money.  The money we use everyday is designed to be scarce and to concentrate power.  It does that very well.

I'm on this list because I see that there could be a deep connection between the ideas of meta-government and meta-currencies, but you illustrate the problem.  We need ways to come together, not ways to keep apart, but most of what I see on this list is contentious, not an opening to greater participation.

I'm in agreement with Bentley, email isn't the best platform to do design and reach consensus.  I find that email is more an more a distraction and very little comes through on that channel besides notification from other systems, and that's an even worse architecture.

If we are to really make something new happen with meta-government or meta-currency, it will necessarily involve an integration of all channels of social media into something better than we have every seen.

I don't want to date myself by telling you how long I've been using email, but I know whereof I speak. 

I would frame the design problem in terms of social architecture, or as I often refer to it, process architecture: <A HREF="http://gerry.wagn.org/Gerry+Process_Architect">http://gerry.wagn.org/Gerry+Process_Architect</A>  My experience in systems design says that you design both from the top down and bottom up and meet in the middle.  Building needs to be bottom up, guided by an expansive vision, but not controlled top down.  That's what is very broken in what we see in systems everywhere.

Here is more writing on the wealth building cycle that I find to be central to any collaborative work we might undertake: <A HREF="http://gerry.wagn.org/Wealing_Cycle">http://gerry.wagn.org/Wealing_Cycle</A>

Look to nature for models.  Oh and watch this film too:  <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuBMpc_3S04">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuBMpc_3S04</A>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, thats too vague.
</I>&gt;<i> I glanced over the flowplace website and in the FAQ it says, that money is
</I>&gt;<i> something issued by nations, but its not or its only part of what money is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Really, i think i have realized a trend at metagovernment.
</I>&gt;<i> People think about meta systems all the time, like:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Create a meta money system, where people could create their own money.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Create a meta democracy system, where people could use their own voting
</I>&gt;<i> processes
</I>&gt;<i> ... it will somehow guarantee that those projects are compatible to each
</I>&gt;<i> other.
</I>&gt;<i> ... its &quot;astronautic architecture&quot; what is created here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not think its a bad thing to think about such high-level
</I>&gt;<i> architectures, but when it comes to metagovernment, it can never be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in a top down fashion, because that process in itself can never
</I>&gt;<i> work, because its thise process itself that has to change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So how can you create &quot;astronautic architecture&quot; in a bottom-up fashion,
</I>&gt;<i> that means:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Start something people could use immediately + it creates value for them
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Will &quot;naturally grow&quot; into the wanted &quot;astronautic architecture&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Its more important to create a &quot;small pattern&quot; which brings value to the
</I>&gt;<i> people who use it and if enough people use it, it will unfold into the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;astronautic architecture&quot;. It will start grass roots and virally spread
</I>&gt;<i> because its beneficial to all the people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And if there is already someone who started such a thing, try to contact
</I>&gt;<i> him and join the process. <A HREF="https://payswarm.com/">https://payswarm.com/</A> (for example)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Meta-currency is not any one currency or system of currencies, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intention is to create core protocols, think of it as HTML/HTTP for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currencies. Because of this, the answer to any of your specific questions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be &quot;yes&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure that there is a lot of active work going on that is specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to meta-currency, there is a loose community of people who have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working on the ideas. There is a prototype or sorts under the name of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flowplace (<A HREF="http://flowplace.org">http://flowplace.org</A>) which demonstrates the basics of what we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have called the &quot;wealing cycle&quot; (under an analogy that wealth is to wealing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as health is to healing).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The core idea are that there would be openness and transparency throughout
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the system, and we identified four domains of oppenness:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Open Rules (a language to declare the rules and processing of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connected group of currencies for a community). The idea is that there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be a formal language that meta-currency engines could implement. We
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have been mostly ruby based, so we have been thinking in terms of ruby DSLs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (domain specific languages).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Open Identity where we can largely build off of the open identity work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that has been done by others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Open Transport -- mainly the principle that all participants in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community of flows can access the raw flows according to standard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols. Implementation of this would be largely using standard web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols (RESTful apis with XML/JSON data)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Open Data -- goes more or less directly with 3 above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You ask great questions and those are exactly the ones that each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meta-currency community would have to answer for themselves. The whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point of this effort is that we expect there to be a discovery process
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where each community has to define what is wealth for them and how to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; measure it and make it visible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm pretty sure that every community will want to build on a similar cycle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the one at FlowPlace where cycles of wealth building declare and gather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around &quot;intentions&quot; and these intentions go through refinement in planning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and action phases, then they complete in reflection about what happened; an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acknowledgement of successes and failures and sharing gratitude and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; celebration of what was completed.
