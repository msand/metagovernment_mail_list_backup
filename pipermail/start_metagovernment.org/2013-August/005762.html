Alexander,

I apologize that the website did not have adequate instructions. It's
changing so quickly right now I couldn't keep them accurate. Here are some:
You can open a statement by clicking the + sign next to it to see it's pros
and cons. If you click on a statement some controls will appear letting you
add pros and cons. You could then add the statements you wrote under each
bullet in the email. A pro or con should have only one concept per
statement. You can save you changes by clicking the &quot;Save as new&quot; button
and the system will provide a new web address so you can see and share your
changes while preserving the previous version. There are a lot of possible
features (like email updates) but since it's a hobby I want to have
confidence the concept works before spending more time on it.

I agree that it is not as exciting but I am focusing on clarity right now.
I put the bullet points in the email and they were based on summarizing the
statements in the previous messages by the people discussing in All Angles.
This example is only shallow because the argument was shallow so far. You
can see a larger example at <A HREF="http://AllAngles.co/12.">http://AllAngles.co/12.</A> It can go as deep as
people are willing to go. I will add your feedback that it is boring, needs
to email out the content , and needs clear instructions.  if you have time
to look at it again I would appreciate any additional feedback you have.
You can participate in the feedback process directly by clicking the
feedback button on the right where others trying out the website have added
theirs. The feedback system uses a lot of email for delivering the content.
