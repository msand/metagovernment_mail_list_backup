<PRE>Hi Alex, (Another great response!)

So now we (you and I) are agreed on what our (Metagovernment) business 
is: making proposals and reaching agreements.

If others reading have other views, maybe start a new thread to present 
them: &quot;What is our business?&quot;

Staying with the &quot;tackle one issue at a time&quot; practice, let us next 
address the issue: &quot;Compensating Metagovernance Work&quot;.

(To leave this thread open for further spin-off topics, I will now put 
that issue on a new thread ...)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dont get your question, whose business?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; I dont know your definition of corporation, but democracy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        mainly happens on the street through spending money or not on
</I>&gt;<i>        certain things, and it happens every day during work time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The Metagovernment community is now on the way to becoming a
</I>&gt;<i>     non-profit startup. The startup will be in the business of
</I>&gt;<i>     attracting donations and then spending that money to design,
</I>&gt;<i>     develop and deploy democratic decision systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This approach is ok, but not as good as it could be. It would be 
</I>&gt;<i> better, if it would not need donations and had a valid business model 
</I>&gt;<i> instead. Maybe not metagovernment itself, but its projects. It might 
</I>&gt;<i> be more healthy to actually be self sustained.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     You and I and the other members of the Metagovernment community
</I>&gt;<i>     are already part of that startup. We have equity in the startup by
</I>&gt;<i>     virtue of our participation -- which is just the way you want it
</I>&gt;<i>     to be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No its not. I want it to be hardcoded into numbers. Right now, it all 
</I>&gt;<i> depends on the good will of people around here. But maybe currently 
</I>&gt;<i> not much is involved. If a metagovernment project will gain real 
</I>&gt;<i> influence because its used by many people and if donations will start 
</I>&gt;<i> to come in, this will change. So will everyone have something to say 
</I>&gt;<i> about that? Could i bring it to a court? do i have a veto? what if 
</I>&gt;<i> someone new joins? will he immediately have the same rights as Michael 
</I>&gt;<i> Allen?
</I>&gt;<i> Currently all this is fuzzy and we dont need to think about bringing 
</I>&gt;<i> some issues to a court and fight about it, but its only because there 
</I>&gt;<i> is no big steak to fight about yet. ....it will change and even if 
</I>&gt;<i> those who are currently arround would never fight about it, new people 
</I>&gt;<i> might pop up who will only come because they think there is something 
</I>&gt;<i> that could be grabbed ....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If we ourselves (Metagovernment) are unable to agree upon a full
</I>&gt;<i>     direct democratic decision system design through which we
</I>&gt;<i>     ourselves can then make decisions in operating our own startup,
</I>&gt;<i>     then &quot;they&quot; (anyone outside of our own community) would be silly
</I>&gt;<i>     to suppose that we have any special expertise that would help
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;them&quot; to make decisions democratically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, and i have said that in the past. I believe, that metagovernment 
</I>&gt;<i> or even single projects have to use their own software to organize 
</I>&gt;<i> themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> for example: i've pointed out, that VOTOROLA should use their system 
</I>&gt;<i> to distribute work between developers and other people involved in the 
</I>&gt;<i> votorola project. they should use it to inform all people who are 
</I>&gt;<i> involved with the votorola project. they should use it to delegate work.
</I>&gt;<i> after all: one feature of votorola is to create an issue and let 
</I>&gt;<i> people pool together ressources (one of them might be votes) to 
</I>&gt;<i> realize a project.... votorola itself is not different in that regard, 
</I>&gt;<i> so its all about &quot;eat ur own dogfood&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> same goes with metagov. metagov vision, metagov goals, staying 
</I>&gt;<i> informed about metagov projects, putting in some personal ressources 
</I>&gt;<i> (may it be money, time, expertise, whatever...)
</I>&gt;<i> all people around here do it for idealistic reasons, but if it should 
</I>&gt;<i> become a mainstream thing in the future, it has to work with total 
</I>&gt;<i> egoists too, therefore it MUST support a system that could be used, so 
</I>&gt;<i> that everyone could bring issues to a court to have their rights enforced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that needs to be based on CONTRACT LAW. Every action u do within a 
</I>&gt;<i> software system needs to be grounded in contract law and information 
</I>&gt;<i> be presented in a way, that it could easily be used to convince a 
</I>&gt;<i> court. it has to be unambiguous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     We need to &quot;dine on our own dogfood&quot; as proof-of-concept that we
</I>&gt;<i>     know what we are talking about, so that when we approach others
</I>&gt;<i>     outside of our community for donations or as prospective users of
</I>&gt;<i>     our systems, they won't just laugh at us (e.g., &quot;let me know when
</I>&gt;<i>     they finish playing in the sandbox&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, true.
</I>&gt;<i> if metagovernment would really would like to go down that road, then 
</I>&gt;<i> there needs to be a project that actually starts small, with a 
</I>&gt;<i> cross-plattform webapp, that can be used on a mobile phone too. the 
</I>&gt;<i> features and direction in which this software will be developed has to 
</I>&gt;<i> be decided in a &quot;democratic process&quot; by metagovernment people 
</I>&gt;<i> manually, until its possible by using the tool itself to decide upon 
</I>&gt;<i> which road to walk down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        You say: &quot;a job is where democracy happens&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>     I say, right here right now is where democracy happens, between
</I>&gt;<i>     you and I, in this discourse. (This is our work environment --
</I>&gt;<i>     yours and mine.) In each instance that we (you and I) succeed in
</I>&gt;<i>     reaching agreement, we have taken one more small step toward full
</I>&gt;<i>     global direct democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> YES, BUT ... :-)
</I>&gt;<i> We have to generalize it, which means, even though we talk about 
</I>&gt;<i> creating a method for other &quot;work collectives&quot; (may it be companies or 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever) to organize themselves in a democratic fashion, we still 
</I>&gt;<i> have to classify what we are doing in &quot;business vocabulary&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So maybe, what we are doing involves multiple &quot;business domains&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> We discuss our target groups (it might be companies or families or 
</I>&gt;<i> ngo's or a municipality or whatever)
</I>&gt;<i> We discuss how to approach stuff (maybe that falls under &quot;strategic 
</I>&gt;<i> management&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its vital to translate all aspects of a plattform people could use 
</I>&gt;<i> into &quot;business vocabulary&quot;, because thats what people at work will 
</I>&gt;<i> understand, you could even give new meaning or at least twist the 
</I>&gt;<i> existing meaning to/of some &quot;business vocabulary&quot; if people learn 
</I>&gt;<i> about the vocabulary through usage of the software system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        You say: &quot;The work people do every day is what they have insight
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        into and what they are familiar with.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The work that you and I do every day has to do with conceiving and
</I>&gt;<i>     designing and discussing democratic decision systems. That is what
</I>&gt;<i>     we (you and I) have insight into and what we are familiar with. We
</I>&gt;<i>     need to help *ourselves* argue about it and make *ourselves*
</I>&gt;<i>     owners of our personal work environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, i'm doing it in my spare time. I'm studying computer science 
</I>&gt;<i> and business administration and currently doing an internship as an 
</I>&gt;<i> entrepreneur in residence and i'm a web developer too (i use 
</I>&gt;<i> javascript/html5/css3/nodejs).
</I>&gt;<i> i'm writing my thesis about the financial crisis and the rules of 
</I>&gt;<i> money and equity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to found my own company, but a company but i want it to be 
</I>&gt;<i> organized in a way which is p2p grass roots democracy and it should be 
</I>&gt;<i> scalable too, and it should be easy to co-operate with other companies 
</I>&gt;<i> who use the same approach, eventually blurring the borders between the 
</I>&gt;<i> co-operating companies. It should be more about the people involved in 
</I>&gt;<i> that then about the companies as abstract artificial entities...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There should also be some kind of &quot;interface&quot; that would enable those 
</I>&gt;<i> p2p-companies to work together with existing companies and maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> influence those to change their way to work too (but that will 
</I>&gt;<i> probably depend on how successful those p2p-companies will be in general)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Then maybe our own self esteem will increase, and we may feel
</I>&gt;<i>     comfortable enough to tackle the next layer in the hierarchy in a
</I>&gt;<i>     democratic fashion. Our own work together (you and I) will then
</I>&gt;<i>     grow bottom up and so will the tools THAT WE OURSELVES USE, in
</I>&gt;<i>     doing our own work together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        You say: &quot;Its easier to create a tool and make people use it, when
</I>&gt;<i>        you start with a startup or a project team and make it work&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     We are a startup. We (self-selected members of the Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i>     community) have equity in that startup. We can start with us. We
</I>&gt;<i>     can start with us NOW.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, i know. we are and i still believe we should do exactly that, 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;eat our own dogfood&quot; and if its not possible, because we have some 
</I>&gt;<i> requirements which are not supported by the metagov projects yet, we 
</I>&gt;<i> have to add those features.
</I>&gt;<i> This will also create a &quot;focus&quot; on those features which are really needed.
</I>&gt;<i> And if metagovernment would earn money on their own, the software 
</I>&gt;<i> would be more similar to something a classical company could use to 
</I>&gt;<i> organize itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Donations are a &quot;nice to have&quot; thing, but i believe, the tools 
</I>&gt;<i> developed by metagov should aim to be self-sustained.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question: If metagov people put effort into a software which can and 
</I>&gt;<i> will be used by other people, so that they can organize their work and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;make money&quot; from it, part of their success will be because it was in 
</I>&gt;<i> part enabled because of the metagov software that company used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     We (you and I and other community members) begin by reaching
</I>&gt;<i>     agreements, one after another after another, as quickly and
</I>&gt;<i>     efficiently as possible. (The aim is not to aimlessly, endlessly
</I>&gt;<i>     chatter. The aim is to reach agreements, one after another after
</I>&gt;<i>     another, as quickly and efficiently as possible. Our progress is
</I>&gt;<i>     measured by the quality and quantity of that growing corpus of
</I>&gt;<i>     agreements.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes. and depending on the issue, its easier if there is a software 
</I>&gt;<i> that supports this.
</I>&gt;<i> there is software which helps with finding a good date/time for a 
</I>&gt;<i> meeting (doodle.com &lt;<A HREF="http://doodle.com">http://doodle.com</A>&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i> If we would chat about it on this email list, it would take longer.
</I>&gt;<i> For all kinds of business issues there might be features of the 
</I>&gt;<i> software, so that all those who are involved in the issue or 
</I>&gt;<i> interested in it, can quickly reach consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     At this point, we don't have any special tools. We have only
</I>&gt;<i>     listserv emails and wiki-pages. But even just those tools are
</I>&gt;<i>     sufficient to enable us to work toward growing our corpus of
</I>&gt;<i>     agreements. We just need to focus on our business: making
</I>&gt;<i>     proposals and reaching agreements. That is the business of our
</I>&gt;<i>     startup. That is what we produce, and what we will be helping
</I>&gt;<i>     others produce.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Do you agree? (Shall we start making proposals with the aim of
</I>&gt;<i>     reaching agreements?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes. i dont know how to start a metagovernment process. there is a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem with all of this:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. developers want to develop the way they think is the best one
</I>&gt;<i> 2. non-developers have ideas too but cannot code
</I>&gt;<i> 3. driving developer effort into community decided features that 
</I>&gt;<i> developers might not be convinced of, will need developers to be paid 
</I>&gt;<i> in some way (shares/money/something else)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or to put it more generally in a way that might not be too popular on 
</I>&gt;<i> this mailinglist:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Someone who puts lots of effort into metagovernment for several years
</I>&gt;<i> vs.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Someone who just joined the mailinglist recently and starts to talk 
</I>&gt;<i> a lot
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Will their &quot;votes&quot; both have the same weight? ...like maybe on real 
</I>&gt;<i> issues.
</I>&gt;<i> suppose there is already donations to metagovernment or people should 
</I>&gt;<i> invest their own work/time/ressources into something. why should they? 
</I>&gt;<i> what about free riders?
</I>&gt;<i> There is so many problems which exist because there is no mechanism 
</I>&gt;<i> that can reward those who do stuff. how to assess what people do? who 
</I>&gt;<i> should asses it and in which way?
</I>&gt;<i> how to share any cake that might get created? will everyone get the 
</I>&gt;<i> same no matter how much effort he or she has put into something? will 
</I>&gt;<i> there be shares? will someone decide upon a &quot;wage&quot;? will all decide? 
</I>&gt;<i> will it become beaurocratic???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i believe we have to discuss this issue and decide upon it in order to 
</I>&gt;<i> make outcome more predictable. *Assume i put in 40hours a week or 
</I>&gt;<i> 60hours a week into metagovernment.
</I>&gt;<i> i would have to be a very rich person, because otherwise, how would i 
</I>&gt;<i> pay my bills?*
</I>&gt;<i> Even if i believe in the metagovernment vision, how can i ever put in 
</I>&gt;<i> all my effort into it?
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, those who do put effort into it have to &quot;write it off&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> immediately and need to be intrinsically motivated all the way and do 
</I>&gt;<i> it for idealistic reasons and a kind of hope, that one day the effort 
</I>&gt;<i> might make a difference....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...but only very few people can operate this way, most people 
</I>&gt;<i> (mainstream) will never do it and some of them (with very egocentric 
</I>&gt;<i> tendencies) might even frown upon it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The metagovernment vision is way to important to put it on such a 
</I>&gt;<i> sandily foundation.
</I>&gt;<i> But in order to change that, without corrupting the vision, we have to 
</I>&gt;<i> decide upon a mechanism of how &quot;the cake is shared&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Manye on this list might avoid this question as good as they can, but 
</I>&gt;<i> this must be solved if it should ever be successful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some startups grow from 0 to 500 workers in under a year and set new 
</I>&gt;<i> trends that revolutionize a certain domain of life for a certain 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;target group&quot; of customers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Put it differently:
</I>&gt;<i> Why can 500 freelancers not &quot;over night&quot; create something that could 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;compete&quot; with a company with 500 workers? Its both 500 skilled 
</I>&gt;<i> people, but the degree of organization (network of processes) is much 
</I>&gt;<i> better within the company, i believe thats the main reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> how to enable people to set up complex work processes on the fly to 
</I>&gt;<i> efficiently produce resulst? people need to pay bills, people only can 
</I>&gt;<i> spend their time ONCE!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this issue is not tackled by metagovernment, but i feel its vital and 
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be solved!
</I>&gt;<i> Everything else will fall in place if this issue is solved, because 
</I>&gt;<i> its possible to center all features of a software around this 
</I>&gt;<i> foundation, but its avoided.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That needs to be changed!!! :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
