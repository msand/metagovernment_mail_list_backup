<PRE>Hi all,

I did not follow the whole discussion but there are, in my view, elements of binary economics. In case you don&#8217;t know binary economics, it can be found on <A HREF="http://www.cesj.org/">http://www.cesj.org/</A> 

Kind regards

Paul

Hi Alex,

It seems that you have the makings for starting a startup: a &quot;founder team&quot; that offers the service of setting up other new startups in the manner you suggest. The success of those other startups that used your arrangements and practices would then provide validation of the arrangements and practices, at least from the perspective of each startup (though not necessarily from the perspective of society as a whole, or nature, or future generations).

I went through what you wrote and tried to pick out the problems that you are trying to solve. Here is what I came up with:

  a.. The richest keep becoming richer because they can sit back and let the structure work for them once they have invested. 
  b.. To not let them sit back, there needs to be a &quot;social process&quot; within the startup of constantly evaluating results to measure progress. 
  c.. Given such an internal process, it is then possible to arrange that shares can &quot;waste away&quot; if the shareholder is not continually doing work to help the startup. 
  d.. This would in turn enable everyone in the startup to be a shareholder (creating and maintaining shareholdings through working), so that compensation would be in the form of a dividend paid to shares held, rather than in the form of wages or salaries. 
  e.. In such a system, the richest (initial investors) would no longer have a free ride forever after the initial investment, which would be fairer, and would over time spread wealth away from the richest toward those who actually do the work. 
Have I correctly understood the essence of what you are trying to accomplish?

  I dont want to talk about money, because it leads to nowhere, because its not actionable. I'm writing my thesis about money and the financial crisis and am fine with it.

  The thoughts i'd like to have input on is &quot;the rules of equity&quot;.
  I'm not sure which angle is the right one to have a perspective on what i'd like to propose so that people will not oppose it out of some kind of learned reflexes.

  Whats entrepreneurship all about, from an equity point of view?
  Leave customers and product aside, its all about creating equity for yourself and investors. Once you've it up and running, you might be able to lean back and let the structure work for you. Thats why 98 of 100 persons of the FORBES MAGAZINES &quot;Richest Persons Charts&quot; are entrepreneurs and probably many of them within the financial industrie, because they leverage the rules of money and equity.

  STATUS QUO
  Whats a common practice or topic you have to get into when you become an entrepreneur and want to found a company? Its contract law and corporate law.
  You pay wages, you get shares, and often there are &quot;founder teams&quot;, so they craft a company or partner agreement in which, amongst other things, document:
  - who gets how many shares?
  - how many shares do external investors get?
  - how might be able to vote to which degree?
  - if an investor/partner leaves, will he lose his shares? can they be bought back?
  (think of facebook and the programer who helped zuckerberg in the early stages)
  - do partners have to earn there shares? (so called VESTING)

  ...so essentially, there is a lot of custom rules or best practices, like (tag along, drag along <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag-along_right">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag-along_right</A>) ... which are just set up to make sure what happens to EQUITY at any point in time.


  NOW WHAT?
  Something that i believe to be essential in order for an alternative approach to work, is a &quot;social process&quot; of constantly evaluating results to measure progress from day one and have a lot of transpareceny (for example: in a startup)

  3 Techniques which are already best practices in their domain
  TECHNIQUE 1
  There is a method called &quot;Business Model Canvas&quot;, which is a top-down-view of a startup which you draw on a canvas with your team (could also be done digitally).
  Then you attach hypotheses and their tests (todo's for the team) to every area of the company (partners, (activities+ressources), product, (channels, relations) customers) and work through them during the next week.
  So you ITERATE through this process generating business model canvas after business model canvas, making progress visible, + it helps to not lose focus.

  TECHNIQUE 2
  There is a methodology called &quot;agile management technique&quot; and one of them is called scrum. Most software developers should be familiar with it. Within scum, there is a technique called &quot;PLANNING POKER&quot; which is some kind of card game you run through before each 2-week-sprint-iteration (which means 2 weeks of doing work) to upfront try to estimate how many tasks you could accomplish from an priorityqueue of features/tasks.

  TECHNIQUE 3
  Financial Bookkeeping and Depreciation. Where many &quot;accounts&quot; exists and you update them for each business transaction and you also calculate the depreciation over time, so you know your &quot;true costs&quot; because you have to bear &quot;replacement investments&quot; in mind.


  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
  Now if you use all those 3 techniques, you will eventually end up with a process, where a digital business model canvas can give transparencey to all participants about the current state of the company. Combined with the Planning Poker Approach, its possible to measure progress or do some kind of bookkeeping or point system, where you measure how much all your points are worth and after each iteration you could reevaluate in retrospective to what degree your assumptions became true and this practice will sharpen everyones ability to make such guesses (learning process).

  Now if you also account for depreciation (some todo's, like results of &quot;a customer interview&quot; or &quot;cleaning a room&quot; will depreciate faster than a bought &quot;office table&quot;), you could calculate an average rate of depreciation with which earned points waste away.
  Then there is also those points who have to be &quot;written off&quot; after you did some kind of work which turned out to be a waste of time.... ...but the process of this is weaved into the CORE TECHNIQUE (with business model canvas) around which you build everything else and which helps you to keep focus.


  What does it mean? And how is this related to the &quot;STATUS QUO&quot;?
  1. Now, what if i buy an office chair and give it &quot;points&quot; during a weekly planning poker session? The &quot;office chair&quot; also has a value in &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot;. If many companies will do this approach, you essentially get an &quot;exchange rate&quot; between your companies internal point system and &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot; and the like.
  2. What if this process works well, why not make these points REAL SHARES? And if you do so, why not make everyones SHARES waste away with the average rate of depreciation, so that people have to re-invest, in order to not lose all their shares over time? (=&gt; This will essentially make all this equity agreements or &quot;VESTING&quot; rules kind of superfluous, because if someone decides to quit and doesnt want to sell his shares, they will waste away over time)
  Why should I invest work in earning shares if they waste away???
  Because as long as you have shares, they decide on a potentially &quot;real time basis&quot; how much of the companies revenue (in USD or EUR or the like...) goes into your pocket. So you dont work for a wage, but for those points which eventually are shares and which will decide your monetary income flow (potentially minutely dividends)

  IF this techniques, which in practice should make the average person better off, becomes mainstream practice (which is totally possible, because if there are role models who work this way successfully, it will spread virally, because it will mean more money and more power with less work for everyone beside the top 1%, but it has to start bottom-up and success of practicioners will automatically spread it and make it a mainstream practice.
  ... THEN: shareholders will lose equity over time to those who are actively doing the work, which makes the rules fair again. And because everyone or every company will create their &quot;point system&quot; which will end up having an exchange rate in EUR/USD, they all get used to this and it will or might lay a foundation to tackle the monetary system as such, but for now, this is totally of reach.

    Alex, I for one am very interested in the subjects of &quot;the rules of money&quot; and &quot;the rules of equity&quot;. I agree with you that, unless our new arrangements include changing these, the new arrangements will prove to be half-measures and empty gestures that will not lead to making the world a better place in the long run.

    If you have proposals to offer regarding either of these topics, I would be very interested to read them.

      Hello everyone,

      i'm sure everyone here knows theres lots of issues with democracy and voting and lots of stuff that could be improved on that &quot;frontier&quot;, but i came to think, that there is some very related subjects and thats equity and money.
      Equity gives you votes in the context of your equity.
      Money gives you the right to buy and thus vote on who will prosper and who will not (voting with your purse...)

      I came to the conclusion, that the rules/laws around money are broken and so are the rules around equity.

      Do you know the forbes magazine and their listing of the 100 richest persons on the planet? 98 of them are entrepreneurs, 1 is Steve Balmer from Microsoft and the last one, i dont know.

      If you want to get insanely rich, u have to abuse the broken laws for equity, thus found and raise a successful company.
      The other way would be to get into the financial industrie and instead of abusing broken equity rules, u would abuse broken money laws.

      In essence it eneables you to live of of other peoples work to some degree.
      These broken laws are the main, if not the ONLY reason for the &quot;great and ever stretching divide&quot; between rich and poor. Its also the reason for the financial crisis.

      I believe money is an issue that cannot be tackled right now and have a couple of arguments why i think that to be true which i dont want to get into now, but i think its totally possible to tackle the equity issue and i believe with the equity issue tackled, the money issue will follow by itself sooner or later.

      Does this topic somehow sound interesting? If so, i would really like to get into the details, but if there is nobody on this list who is interested in these topics, i dont want to waste your time.

      kind regards
      alex
