<PRE>[&gt;question
   from:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">marc at merkstduwas.de</A>
   to:all]
   [&gt;1] Why do you do not want to start right now and right there where we 
are? [1&lt;]
   [&gt;2] What if we realy start prototyping based on email? [2&lt;]
[question&lt;]

[&gt;quintessence
   from:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">marc at merkstduwas.de</A>]
   [&gt;1] Solely because we are currently unable to imagine that email is 
sufficient for prototyping a discussion system, does not mean that it is not 
possible! [1&lt;]
   [&gt;2]
      [&gt;problem] Let's say our goal is to 'migrate' informal discussion into 
a formal representation so that some piece of software can analyse it.
         [&gt;solution] That is only possible by applying rules to the 
discussion.
            [&gt;implication] Therefore we need to define a simple set of rules 
that makes it possible to formalize a conversation. [implication&lt;]
         [solution&lt;]
      [problem&lt;]
   [2&lt;]
[quintessence&lt;]

[&gt;conclusion
   from:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">marc at merkstduwas.de</A>]
   [&gt;1] Even if this is realy a quick shoot from the hip, I guess this post 
demonstrates the general problem with formalizing an informal process. [1&lt;]
   [&gt;2] Even if twitter did it quite well, their rules are extremely strict.
      [&gt;2.1] BUT, their biggest innovation is to keep messages short!
         [&gt;2.1.1] That is using ones inherent joy of playing. Because it is 
a real challenge to put it all in 140 chars.
            [&gt;implication] Therefore our FIRST RULE might be: Keep it short 
and simple! [implication&lt;]
         [2.1.1&lt;]
      [2.1&lt;]
   [2&lt;]
   [&gt;3] The used technology is secondary. It is the set of rules (process) 
that matters. [3&lt;]
[conclusion&lt;]

   [&gt;1] I guess it was a real joy for you to read this post [;)] [1&lt;]
   [&gt;question]
      Is someone out there who can imagine that all those braces could be 
avoided somehow?

Daniel, Greetings!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Daniel&gt; First, I suggest we transition our discussions to a
    forum-like platform.

Ned&gt; Yes. My impression is that you, Harry, and others that have all the
appropriate expertise are in agreement about this. And I agree that
trying to parse and otherwise play with emails is not worth the effort,
particularly at the prototype stage. As you say: &quot;That way we can focus
on the correctness of a reference implementation as a web platform and
later start pushing features down other channels (email, mobile, voice,
etc.).&quot; Exactly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Daniel&gt; All of these things could be done separately but in our
    case, I believe two conditions are necessary to actually set things
    in motion :

    - Build and contribute to something that is in *real use*. If we can
    manage to eat our own dog food, not only will it taste sweeter for
    those who produce it but I'm positive we'll have even more success
    selling it.

    - Build a free discussion and informal communication platform and
    make it the foundation for any other system. Collaborative
    governance ultimately is all about building a model for
    transitioning from INFORMAL to FORMAL, be it ideas, statements,
    arguments, decisions, action plans, etc. It all starts with an
    informal discussion even at the highest levels of formalism (how
    would you go about proposing a change in the constitution if not by
    first expressing your thoughts with your own words in an informal
    context ?).

Ned&gt; Yes. In my view, you nailed it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Daniel&gt; Let me know what you think about all this and if we can
    settle on a course of action, I can start working on a migration plan.

Ned&gt; The initial course of action that you have suggested seems good to
me: set up a forum-like platform, move our discussions there, and have
the forum send emails back to the list. Then, as topics emerge through
informal discussion that are ready to be formalized and decided, their
discussion moves to settings such as AllAngles, which are integrated
parts of our evolving overall platform.

</I>&gt;<i> With almost no extra effort, the forum can at least allow us to create 
</I>&gt;<i> some structure by segmenting the conversations across categories and 
</I>&gt;<i> topics and by providing a threaded view in the web interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, well ... we'd have what I believe would be a minimally viable 
</I>&gt;<i> platform for experimentation. A platform that would actually be *in use* 
</I>&gt;<i> since our &quot;real&quot; discussions would be conducted on it. Through small 
</I>&gt;<i> increments and iterations, we can move towards a rich discourse / debate / 
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative reasoning platform :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Integration with a wiki / publishing platform
</I>&gt;<i> - Argumentation
</I>&gt;<i> - Decision formalization
</I>&gt;<i> - Integration with external e-gov tools and platforms
</I>&gt;<i> - Integration with a ticket-like system for the delegation of tasks
</I>&gt;<i> - Identity management (SSO, reward system, karma, membership 
</I>&gt;<i> certification - badges, privacy, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
