<PRE>Bentley, Greetings!

I very much concur with your preference that the prototype website not 
feature voting. (My impression is, that makes you and me a minority of 2 
within the community, so we probably don't want to call for a vote on 
the issue ...) :^)

If you want to set a prototype site up and need a playmate, I'm there. 
Also, I am poised to begin playing on the TruthMapping.com site (setting 
up topics to debate), so we could spend some time playing over there 
some as well. And, we could play in standard wiki-pages, doing 
everything manually as we figure out in real time what we want to happen 
when and where, and writing out specifications as we do.

What you have just done in your most recent email, concisely laying out 
the arguments pro and con for using email as the development base, I 
take to be a tremendous service to the community.

To follow up on that excellent effort, one thing we might do in the 
course of our prototyping efforts (to give us &quot;grist for our mill&quot;) 
would be to &quot;mine&quot; past listserv emails to extract out the dozens 
(hundreds!) of issues in the past that have been raised, only to have 
the subsequent discourse fizzle out without the issue being settled. If 
we could extract and organize those, we could give them new life (they 
keep rising from the dead again and again anyway), and give them a 
fighting chance to actually be settled (through our new prototype system).

Our stock-in-trade in this community is decision making. We can start by 
*successfully* making our own decisions on our own issues, as 
proof-of-concept demonstration to the world that we know what we are 
talking about when we offer the world our systems.
