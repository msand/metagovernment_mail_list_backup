<PRE>The Rules page is strictly about modification of the Wiki (or more precisely, of the home page). It's purpose was to be a test case for expanding out to a larger scope (e.g., the bylaws you propose).

The decision rule there is set up to be 100% for small groups and to gradually decrease down toward 80% as the group gets larger (though that 80% standard can be tweaked). Yes, this is in opposition to your suggestion of no unresolved objections. I do support consensus decision-making, but as Pietro noted much earlier, psychologists estimate that 1% to 4% of people are sociopaths. Making a 100% decision-rule for large-scale governance might be quite impractical. We landed on 80% as an &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; and a reasonable standard for consensus. But it can be changed by, well, 80% of the people deciding it should be changed.

Concerning how votes/participation should be cast, I am leery of specifying one technique. Different member groups do it differently. You may like your way better, but they may not. The point of free-range voting is to allow people to participate in the way they are most comfortable, which should then be accommodating of whatever technique any system wants to use. What do you see as wrong with &quot;naked voting?&quot; In a well-crafted environment, isn't a naked vote really the same as proposing the same thing as what someone else has already proposed? Instead of re-proposing their exact text, one can just +1 it. Could you view that as a translating technique between naked voting and proposing?

</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>

</I>&gt;<i> Yes! I wholeheartedly agree: there is lots of overlap, and each point &quot;should&quot; be examined by the group. (But I don't quite understand what you mean by &quot;adding on another layer&quot; ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The relations of the proposed bylaws to the material of the &quot;Mission and Vision&quot; page are complex, but mostly the points of the two proposals seem (to me) to be compatible. (If you see conflicts, by all means point them out.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, bylaws #3 and #4 stand in direct opposition to the decision method of the &quot;Rules&quot; page. That might be a good place to start. What problems do you have with switching from &quot;naked voting&quot; to proposing as the means through which individuals participate in decision making? (Perhaps start a new thread dedicated to that conversation?)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The organization I am talking about would be an American non-profit corporation. It would be subservient to this group, but would be organized under United States law so that it could be eligible for grants from foundations. For that purpose, the bylaws need to be a document that shows the IRS and the foundations that it is a responsible organization -- and by responsible, they mean that money is managed responsibly and that someone will be held to account if it is mismanaged.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here's an example of US nonprofit org bylaws:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am planning on engaging legal advice to help in drafting our bylaws in such a way that they can make the IRS and the foundations happy but also not violate our principles. That's going to be very difficult, but if it can be done, there is a great side-benefit in that we'll be creating a model for other organizations to start up using collaborative governance.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What follows is a first draft of proposed bylaws for &quot;an organization to serve us&quot;. This would be the global metagovernment (I have called it a &quot;society&quot;) that would drive all of the various national foundations and such around the world.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The draft also exists as a wiki-page:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Society_Bylaws">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Society_Bylaws</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  1. *MEMBERSHIP: UNCOERCED*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Any sentient being (globally) may freely choose to become a member
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     of the society. Any member may freely choose to cease to be a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     member of the society.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  2. *DECISION MAKING: DIRECT DEMOCRACY*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Each member of the society is free to participate in making any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     decision that the society makes. Each member participates in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     decision making on equal footing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     (Emergency decisions are made through a subordinate emergency
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     response system. Any member may participate in the post-emergency
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     reviews of decisions made during emergencies.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  3. *PARTICIPATION: THROUGH PROPOSING*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Members participate in decision making exclusively through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     making.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  4. *DECISION RULE: NO UNRESOLVED OBJECTIONS
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     *
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     The decision rule is that a proposal is cleared to be implemented
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     at the point that it faces no unresolved objections. Objections
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     are proposed. Objections are resolved through successive,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     recursive proposing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  5. *NOTIFICATION: PROPOSAL PROFILES, PROPOSAL MAGNETS*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Effecting direct democracy at the scale of the global population
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     requires that the decision system have an affordable sub-system
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     that reliably notifies each member of new proposals that may be of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     interest, and that avoids inundating individuals with new
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     proposals not of interest. The details of the software and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     practices that will together effect efficient and reliable global
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     notification will be co-created and evolved through successive
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     successful proposing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  6. *APPLYING PAST DECISIONS: APPRAISAL*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     In order for the decision system to be affordable and reliable at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     the scale of the global population, it must have a sub-system that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     efficiently and reliably applies all relevant past decisions to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     each new proposal that is submitted. (The past decisions serve as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     filters; each new proposal must successfully &quot;pass through&quot; all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     such filters in order to be cleared for implementation.) The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     details of the software and practices that will together effect
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     this will be co-created and evolved through successive successful
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     proposing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  7. *AMENDMENTS: THROUGH PROPOSING*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Additions and amendments to these bylaws may be effected through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     successfully proposing.
