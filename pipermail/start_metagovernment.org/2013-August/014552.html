<PRE>Hi Bentley, Marc, Alex,

@Marc: Yes, the wikiarguments site is definitely relevant. As we add to 
the list of existing attempts to assist discourse decision making, it 
will be very useful to compare and contrast their features, to &quot;pick the 
best and leave the rest&quot; as we select and design the features of our 
dream prototype. (We want to &quot;stand on the shoulders of giants&quot;, not 
&quot;re-invent wheels&quot;.)

At this point we have:

    * AllAngles
    * TruthMapping
    * WikiArguments
    * phpBB Forums
    * ConvinceMe
    * CreateDebate
    * DebateGraph
    * Wiki_Debate
      <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Wiki_debate">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Wiki_debate</A>
    * Debate Tools
      <A HREF="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Debate_tools#Explore-Ideas.com">http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Debate_tools#Explore-Ideas.com</A>
    * ... (and counting ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In deference to Alex's view that email should be in the mix, here are 
some thoughts on how we might integrate the AllAngles into the 
Metagovernment email list.

The AllAngles program subscribes to the list, and receives emails from 
the list. It scans each received email title to determine whether the 
email is from the &quot;AllAngles Notices&quot; thread, and retains the most 
recent email received from that thread (discarding the rest).

Rather than try to fully automate the sending of notices, put a &quot;send 
email notice&quot; button on each page, and let the user choose when to send 
notice.

(Since AllAngles may have topics that are not relevant to 
Metagovernment, maybe there will need to be a pick-list for the button, 
that lets the user choose where to send notification. Alternatively, the 
page itself may know who should be notified.)

When the button is pressed (and the destination selected), the program 
creates an email, that contains a link to the page on which the button 
was pressed, together with whatever other information about the page 
changes is relevant and convenient to gather.

The program then sends that email to the list, as a response to the most 
recently received email from the &quot;AllAngles Notices&quot; thread. (Because 
the listserv adds to the tail of the email infinitely, the program would 
need to delete the tail as part of preparing the reply.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In deference to Alex's view that we focus on &quot;real&quot; content rather than 
&quot;artificial&quot; content, I have started a list of potential AllAngles 
topics for us to create and decide. (The list is itself a topic, to 
which objections can be made.) Items 2 and 3 on the list below are, 
according to Ed, the only two things so far that the Metagovernment 
community has actually decided -- years of discussion, and two decisions ...

   1. The choice whether to be a member of the Metagovernment Society
      should be uncoerced.

      Any sentient being (globally) may freely choose to become a member
      of the society. Any member may freely choose to cease to be a
      member of the society.

   2. Direct Democracy: Society governance should be open to everyone,
      without exception.

      Each member of the society is free to participate in making any
      decision that the society makes. Each member participates in
      decision making on equal footing.

   3. Radical Transparency: Information related to society governance
      should be free and open.
   4. Decision Participation: Through Proposing

      Members participate in decision making exclusively through
      formally proposing (topics, pros, cons, etc.). (The email list is
      used for ancillary discussion.)

      Votes cast apart from proposing (through ballots, polling, &quot;like
      buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such) provide information only,
      and have no formal effect on decision making.

   5. Decision Rule: No Unresolved Objections

      The decision rule is that a proposal is cleared to be implemented
      at the point that it faces no unresolved objections. Objections
      are proposed. Objections are resolved through successive,
      recursive proposing.

   6. Resolving Objections: Proposal validity rests on logic, evidence,
      and authenticity.

      An objection can be resolved by showing that it is not valid (or
      not valid enough).

      ... (topic proposals welcome! (but only &quot;real&quot; topics ...) :^)

</I>&gt;<i> Alexander,

</I>&gt;<i> I apologize that the website did not have adequate instructions. It's 
</I>&gt;<i> changing so quickly right now I couldn't keep them accurate. Here are 
</I>&gt;<i> some: You can open a statement by clicking the + sign next to it to 
</I>&gt;<i> see it's pros and cons. If you click on a statement some controls will 
</I>&gt;<i> appear letting you add pros and cons. You could then add the 
</I>&gt;<i> statements you wrote under each bullet in the email. A pro or con 
</I>&gt;<i> should have only one concept per statement. You can save you changes 
</I>&gt;<i> by clicking the &quot;Save as new&quot; button and the system will provide a new 
</I>&gt;<i> web address so you can see and share your changes while preserving the 
</I>&gt;<i> previous version. There are a lot of possible features (like email 
</I>&gt;<i> updates) but since it's a hobby I want to have confidence the concept 
</I>&gt;<i> works before spending more time on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that it is not as exciting but I am focusing on clarity right 
</I>&gt;<i> now. I put the bullet points in the email and they were based on 
</I>&gt;<i> summarizing the statements in the previous messages by the people 
</I>&gt;<i> discussing in All Angles. This example is only shallow because the 
</I>&gt;<i> argument was shallow so far. You can see a larger example at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://AllAngles.co/12.">http://AllAngles.co/12.</A> It can go as deep as people are willing to go. 
</I>&gt;<i> I will add your feedback that it is boring, needs to email out the 
</I>&gt;<i> content , and needs clear instructions.  if you have time to look at 
</I>&gt;<i> it again I would appreciate any additional feedback you have. You can 
</I>&gt;<i> participate in the feedback process directly by clicking the feedback 
</I>&gt;<i> button on the right where others trying out the website have added 
</I>&gt;<i> theirs. The feedback system uses a lot of email for delivering the 
</I>&gt;<i> content.
