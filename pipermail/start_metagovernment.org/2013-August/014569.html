&gt;<i> I have been quite busy for the last week and come back to the list facing

</I>&gt;<i> arguments being put forward in the various threads here (ones I have only
</I>&gt;<i> able been able to skim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My experience is that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It is extremely difficult to follow all of the thoughts here, because:
</I>&gt;<i>  a. They are disorganized due to the format of email
</I>&gt;<i>  b. They are disorganized due to various ways people respond in email
</I>&gt;<i>  c. The sheer volume and weight makes it difficult to slog through
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes :-)


&gt;<i> 2. If these posts hasn't been in my email inbox, I would not have even
</I>&gt;<i> bothered to try following them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's why i believe the only way is to enhance email iteself, because
thats the only way people can integrate discussion into their daily routine.



&gt;<i> I am not proposing anything there; just pointing out what I think others
</I>&gt;<i> have piecemeal said in these various threads: email is great and awful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes. Great, because everyone is accustomed to use it. And great, because of
that, everyone has it integrated into their daily routine.
Yes. Aweful, because its very unstructured.




&gt;<i> I am having difficulty determining what the outcome is from this, however.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thats, why i proposed, the first feature should be, to make certain
&quot;things&quot; that come up in email discussion, persist. Provide an easy way to
&quot;copy something&quot; that pops up in email discussions into a wiki or some kind
of persistant medium, then make it extremly easy to REFERENCE this in
future email discussions. That alone could reduce the volume of content in
discussions (because one could link to stuff) and it would reduce
repetition of topics (because one could link to stuff).


It seems to me that (and did someone propose this along the way?) a
&gt;<i> workable strategy would be to have a discussion map which follows along the
</I>&gt;<i> emails, providing a way for the uninitiated to orient themselves to the
</I>&gt;<i> conversation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes. Awesome proposal, but...
... it's not about having some kind of &quot;discussion map&quot;, but having a
workflow integrated into email discussion, that will enable participants to
easily add stuff to the discussion map and link it back in into future
email discussions, that way, the normal unstructured &quot;workflow&quot; in email
discussions would be enhanced in a useful way.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. If <A HREF="http://allangles.co/Demo.html?id=14">http://allangles.co/Demo.html?id=14</A> is supposed to be helping, I
</I>&gt;<i> am getting nothing on that page.
