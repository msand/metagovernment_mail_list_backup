<PRE>BUT, how can I take part in the decision, if you leave the mailing list for 
that?

Alex, now that I have had a chance to do a cursory examination of Wagn and
AllAngles and TruthMapping, I am really liking what I see, and they are all
ready to go as starting points for prototyping and development RIGHT NOW
(which is what you want).

This listserv system that we have been using (in my view) has not been
working for us. This thread is an example of that. If we move the discussion
of this thread over to the AllAngles page that Bentley has prepared, RIGHT
NOW, I bet we can actually come to a decision. Why not give it a try?

Browser Plugins-Extensions do exist, so its enough to structure the email by
using html and put it inside of a container and give it an ID, then use that
browser plugin to detect that container and add css+javascript as needed to
the DOM in order to make it interactive.

With stand alone email clients its not that easy, but some of them (ex.
outlook) do support plugins too, and i guess thunderbird does so too.

Sadly, i'm not so sure about mobile email clients.

An alternative could be to provide only information and a button that says:
&quot;REPLY&quot;, &quot;REPLY ALL&quot;, &quot;FORK TOPIC&quot;, .... and whatever else we need.
Those links could be &quot;individualised&quot; by the mail server and serve as
temporary password, like the links you get when u requrest a &quot;password
reset&quot; service when you have forgotten your username/password.
That would open up the browser with an &quot;email client&quot; that has all the
functionality we need for our proposal/discussion/proposal/... tool and
might be used to comment, highlight, fork, and structure my response to a
proposal in those ways i want, then &quot;send it&quot; back to the mailinglist.

Using that method, people would still receive emails the normal way, where
the whole email might look like our browser based interactive email client
(that supports javascript) and has buttons for &quot;REPLY, REPLY ALL, and so
on...&quot; which are just links which open a browser, loading that email content
and serve as an alternative &quot;email client&quot; then.

I have been developing software (including email based software) for over 20
years and I can not think of a way to prototype this consensus building
application in just HTML and CSS without links to a website.

I propose that we create the application as a website and use email to
provide detailed of information to the participants and provide a link for
them to open up the interactive functionality on a web page.

We are not proposing to use a website to replace this email list.

Alexander, I believe that the only option to convince us to use email as an
interactive medium is  to either:

Find a developer that can implement interactive functionality in HTML and
CSS without JavaScript
Propose a way to allow the functionality to work without JavaScript or
websites.
