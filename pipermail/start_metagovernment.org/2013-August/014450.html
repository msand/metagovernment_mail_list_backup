<PRE>discussing money is a waste of time. you should rather discuss something
which might become actionable. there are lots of designs for different
&quot;money systems&quot; and people waste their time to discuss them over and over
again, sometimes they even create regional money systems (there are quite a
few in germany) and they all have their own cult of followers, but
regarding the overall picture, they dont make a difference, because they
are not a mainstream thing. when it comes to money, the 'network effect' is
so strong, that is a total waste of time to try to attack EUR or USD or the
like in a direct manner.

But money is in some ways tied to equity or lets better say, the core ideas
behind money and equity are similar and so are the rules and if you change
one of them, its possible to change the other one too. i believe its way
easier to tackle the equity issue which is also related to ownership and
&quot;the right to vote&quot; then to tackle the money issue.

...this is everything i have to say when it comes to &quot;money&quot;

just my 2 cents

</I>&gt;<i> But money stops everything and everything in the court system is about

</I>&gt;<i> When you get a fine for driving how does that help anything?
</I>&gt;<i> Other than cause undo stress on the individual.
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it make sense to use a point system to where if you got too many
</I>&gt;<i> points you would just be required to attend driving classes or lose your
</I>&gt;<i> license.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of someone who has money just pays and keeps on being an idiot
</I>&gt;<i> driver.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know the stress human beings endure over the legal system?
</I>&gt;<i> With the resources we have we could build the space program and just keep
</I>&gt;<i> going with it. Instead of a competition it would be a shared challenge for
</I>&gt;<i> the world we would get the materials to make it happen.
</I>&gt;<i> We need to show we are mature and can focus on goals.
</I>&gt;<i> That's all we would have then is new goals for the human race.
</I>&gt;<i> Humans would achieve greatness by the measure of sweat and work they have

</I>&gt;<i> Why have we not made the power a public owned system yet? Its because of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Mark,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Ultimately, you appear to be making a set of empirical claims regarding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> money. As such, the claims are open to empirical (experimental) test, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potentially to falsification. Yes? (If the claims are not testable and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potentially falsifiable, then they may fall into the category of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quasi-religious belief -- immune to reason and discourse. If so, then there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is nothing useful that can be said in response, and discussion would be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> waste of time and effort.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I am open to the possibility that there may exist one or more scalable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> social system designs (that do not feature money) that would work out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;better&quot; than the various scalable social system designs that have been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented up to this point on planet earth (that have featured money).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Show me your design -- propose it. I would very much like to see it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Without having yet seen your design, and therefore speaking abstractly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my view is that you are &quot;throwing the baby out with the bathwater&quot;. We use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> money as a medium for transmitting energy, just as we use electricity as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> medium for transmitting energy. I do not see money as being inevitably a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> root of enslavement and corruption, any more than I see electricity as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being inevitably a root of enslavement and corruption.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I have written out a series of proposals concerning money here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a">http://www.wiser.org/article/8947065163a05e305098b17f5bb3077a</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps you can use my proposals as foils in articulating your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corresponding, competing proposals. And also, I will be interested to read
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any direct responses to my &quot;money proposals&quot; that you may have.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with you that, in designing our new social system, we want the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design to forestall and mitigate corruption so far as possible, and to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eliminate slavery entirely. If you can show me a social system design that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not feature money, and that can scale to the level of the global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> population, and that accomplishes those design aims (no slavery, not much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corruption), you will definitely have my attention.
