@Enhancing Email
Most Email Messengers support html/css to some degree. Maybe its possible
to exploit that. Many Email Messengers support plugins and web mail clients
run in browsers support &quot;browser plugins&quot;
Example: Google Mail supports plugins too. I have several installed with
highlight &quot;telephon numbers&quot; inside of emails. Another Plugin offers me to
add a &quot;date&quot; inside of an email to an appointment in my calendar. Another
Plugin offers adding contacts to my adress book and so forth...

Does &quot;email&quot; support some kind of &quot;hidden field&quot; or something that could be
used to submit some kind of meta data which is not lost if someone &quot;replys&quot;
to that email.
(Most Answers contain the original email in comments, so maybe meta data
could be encoded in that?)

So there might be different hacks and workarounds to &quot;enhance&quot; email. Those
who use the plugins could make use of those features. Those who dont should
be educated about the possibilities to use the same enhanced techniques and
if they dont, then at least their usage of a &quot;normal un-enhanced mail
client&quot; should not break the enhanced functionality.

maybe its possible to use DIFF algorithms to check for email replyes for
&quot;reply messagas&quot; and &quot;quoted content&quot; and parse the &quot;answers&quot; as threads
below those original paragraphs.

So if one thinks of those &quot;argument maps&quot;, a quoted paragraph would become
an &quot;argument&quot; and the answer to that &quot;quoted paragraph&quot; will go below it.

Maybe its possible to measure &quot;+1&quot; or &quot;-1&quot; as up or down votes.
Maybe its possible to embed  &quot;add comment&quot; or &quot;persist&quot; or &quot;fork&quot; buttons
to emails.
Clicking &quot;persist&quot; would copy a paragraph to a wiki site and make it
referencable by a &quot;link&quot;

A &quot;fork&quot; button might do the same, but one could add changes and would have
a &quot;counter proposal&quot; or &quot;competing proposal&quot;.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm thinking of the following:
Assumption: There is already a &quot;hidden workflow&quot; in email discussion.
Parts of that workflow are different &quot;techniques&quot; which are used to some
degree by participants in order to accomplish a resolution of the
discussion.

So I imagine, that one starts to GATHER all those techniques, so we need to
watch out for all that which we do when answering emails and infere them.

A few examples of what I mean:

*What do people do?*
1. Writing +1 below a paragraph =&gt; expressing agreement of what was written
by someone.
2. Writing text/comment below a paragraph =&gt; expressing something which is
refered to the quoted paragraph (probably their are different kinds of
intentions when someone does that)
3. linking to something or citing sources in the footer =&gt; building on the
foundation of intersubjective agreements of people (a.k.a &quot;facts&quot;) ?
4. Repeating content that was mentioned in the past in similar ways (try to
persist it in peoples heads, because there is no way of persisting state
between emails if people do not repeat what was already said)

Maybe there are more artifacts....

*What do people want?*
Sometimes they want to make a statement about the world (trying to
establish/find common assumptions that could be build upon, because all
participants of a discussion can relate to those statements because they
have a similar experience)

Sometimes people want to apply logic reasoning or interpretation on the
basis of common assumptions in order to bridge gaps between peoples
opinions ans establish a similar perspective *(thats some kind of &quot;merge&quot;
or &quot;join&quot; behavior)*

Sometimes people want to diverge from established assumptions or
fundamently questioning them. So they take a set of assumptions and
statements that build on them and create some kind of alternative
perspective on things (maybe something like a counter proposal)
*(thats some kind of &quot;fork&quot; behavior)*

What are the most often seen &quot;manually applied pattern&quot; in email
discussions? What are the &quot;conventions&quot; people already use and why do they
use them? whats the general intention behind it, that makes those
&quot;behavioral artifacts&quot; appear?

If we can identify some of them, maybe we can support those in a more
structured way and STILL leave room for freestyle expression.
The latter is important, because if the system is too formalized and doesnt
support a hidden intention, then people might not have a way to express
their intentions in the ways they were used to do and therefore will not
use the &quot;software&quot;, because they find it to rigid/restrictive.

If people start to use those basic features and see the value in it, we
then can start to look what &quot;patterns&quot; occur, which are not anticipated by
the software features in place and then add more &quot;features&quot; that anticipate
those new patterns...
...with this method, it might be possible to formalize discussions step by
step, not leaving people behind and during the process we could learn a lot
about, not only whats needed from a &quot;technical perspective&quot; (CRUD
merge/fork/....), but in which &quot;natural workflows&quot; people use those to make
it easy.



What are your requirements to this enhancement - that's prerequisite (1)?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From my point of view it's vital to keep the principles A and B intact,
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise you will lose the benefits of using email and therefore it would
</I>&gt;<i> not be used any more!
</I>

I remember u wrote about A, B and C, but have already forgotten what it was.
In a &quot;perfect enhanced email system&quot;, i would &quot;hover&quot; my mouse over A or B
and it would tell me what A and/or B was... at least A and B could be links
to that place where i could look up what A and B is....



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  What would be the first step, one would have to take towards YOUR VISION,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if one had to start from where one is currently based (EMAIL). :-P
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably you might implement a proxy between the user (currently reading
</I>&gt;<i> this email) and the magic that happen somewhere on the internet.
</I>&gt;<i> To enable this, first you might define at least one feature of the magic
</I>&gt;<i> that happen, see prerequisite (1), so that you can define an interface upon
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think its really important to choose the right technology for this.
If you choose the wrong technology, it can never take off.
Maybe one should start with an &quot;intelligent mail server&quot; which processes
emails and adds &quot;html/css markup&quot; and &quot;links&quot; and maybe adds a footer too,
which offers to download/install a Browser/MS Outlook/Thunderbird/...
 Plugin/Extension to enhance the usability.

The first feature one could try to implement would be what i mentioned
above.
A feature to easily persist &quot;stuff&quot; and make it easy to &quot;refer&quot; to that
&quot;stuff&quot; later in the discussion. (ex. see Options A and B above)
Maybe, if i add a Link to A or B in my Email, then the &quot;mail server&quot; will
grab the content and paste it INTO the mail send to the list.


If one would start with this feature, maybe one could get rid of a lot of
repeated content and reduce mutation of that content.
