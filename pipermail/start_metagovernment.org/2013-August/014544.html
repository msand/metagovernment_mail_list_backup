<PRE>What a misleading title I chose for this thread!  That's not what I
meant at all.

Let me try to explain, Alex.  Then let's come back to your suggestion
about email, because it does appear to be related.

My explanation has two parts, plus a little magic in between; the
magic is just there to hide the parts that don't matter.  Here goes:
(1) Suppose people are out there discussing some topic like they
always do.  They're scattered here and there, online and offline;
they're informal and messy.  Suddenly there appears on the internet
(magic) a formal summary of their informal discussion.  It could be an
argument map, or some other formal argumentive summary, or any formal
summary at all (picture the best you can imagine).  It just pops into
existence in a remote corner of the internet, and there it is.

(2) A few of the scattered, informal participants notice the summary.
They discover that it's helpful to them in their discussions.  They
just have to look at it and it helps them (magic).  Most don't notice
the summary at all, at least not immediately.  But they feel its
effects all the same (magic) and again those effects are helpful.  The
discussion begins to improve overall in quality, breadth and depth.

That's the basic idea.  The crucial thing to notice is that it begins
in informal discussion, and ends in informal discussion.  The formal
stuff in between (magic) is unimportant in itself.  See what I mean?

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> Probably, there are many ways in which things could be done and many tools

</I>&gt;<i> then some questions could be easily answered by just observing what people

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...no need to think stuff through and to make assumptions, just let them
