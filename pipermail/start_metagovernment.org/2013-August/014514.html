</I>&gt;<i> First, this is talking about currencies, which is a much broader topic

&gt;<i> I'm on this list because I see that there could be a deep connection

</I>&gt;<i> illustrate the problem.  We need ways to come together, not ways to keep
</I>&gt;<i> apart, but most of what I see on this list is contentious, not an opening
</I>&gt;<i> to greater participation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in agreement with Bentley, email isn't the best platform to do design

</I>&gt;<i> very little comes through on that channel besides notification from other
</I>&gt;<i> systems, and that's an even worse architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Email is the medium which is used by most people on a daily basis and
normally all email clients do support html/css/javascript to some degree,
which could be used to create an interface to whatever
&quot;discussion/proposal/voting&quot; plattform people might come up with.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we are to really make something new happen with meta-government or
</I>&gt;<i> meta-currency, it will necessarily involve an integration of all channels
</I>&gt;<i> of social media into something better than we have every seen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think the connection between metagovernment and metacurrencies can be
made on the basis of equity. Equity decides who gets to vote/decide/propose
the course an organization takes. Equity, in theory, is also the basis for
money.
In theory, one without equity is not credit worthy and money
cannot/shouldnot be created for those without equity as a security.
In theory, one without equity is not allowed to vote or decide on issues of
the organization of which she/he has no shares.




&gt;<i> I don't want to date myself by telling you how long I've been using email,
</I>&gt;<i> but I know whereof I speak.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So do most people, because they all use email more or less since their dawn
of the internet.



&gt;<i> I would frame the design problem in terms of social architecture, or as I
</I>&gt;<i> often refer to it, process architecture:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gerry.wagn.org/Gerry+Process_Architect">http://gerry.wagn.org/Gerry+Process_Architect</A>  My experience in systems
</I>&gt;<i> design says that you design both from the top down and bottom up and meet
</I>&gt;<i> in the middle.  Building needs to be bottom up, guided by an expansive
</I>&gt;<i> vision, but not controlled top down.  That's what is very broken in what we
</I>&gt;<i> see in systems everywhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I think the same, but unfortunately, i do not see much bottom-up-thinking
in metagovernment, its mostly top-down.
When it comes to bottom-up, we have to start with ourselves :-) if we
cannot meet our own needs, then something is wrong...

The video that describes flow is the same principle used by financial
accounting and balance sheets and in/out cash flows... ...is there anything
else? 39 minutes is lots of time to explain that simple fundamental
concept, and a lot of blah around it.


Here is more writing on the wealth building cycle that I find to be central
&gt;<i> to any collaborative work we might undertake:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, thats too vague.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I glanced over the flowplace website and in the FAQ it says, that money
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something issued by nations, but its not or its only part of what money
</I>&gt;<i> is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Really, i think i have realized a trend at metagovernment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; People think about meta systems all the time, like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Create a meta money system, where people could create their own money.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Create a meta democracy system, where people could use their own
</I>&gt;<i> voting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; processes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... it will somehow guarantee that those projects are compatible to each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... its &quot;astronautic architecture&quot; what is created here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do not think its a bad thing to think about such high-level
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; architectures, but when it comes to metagovernment, it can never be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented in a top down fashion, because that process in itself can
</I>&gt;<i> never
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work, because its thise process itself that has to change.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So how can you create &quot;astronautic architecture&quot; in a bottom-up fashion,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that means:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Start something people could use immediately + it creates value for
</I>&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Will &quot;naturally grow&quot; into the wanted &quot;astronautic architecture&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Its more important to create a &quot;small pattern&quot; which brings value to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people who use it and if enough people use it, it will unfold into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;astronautic architecture&quot;. It will start grass roots and virally spread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because its beneficial to all the people.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And if there is already someone who started such a thing, try to contact
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; him and join the process. <A HREF="https://payswarm.com/">https://payswarm.com/</A> (for example)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Meta-currency is not any one currency or system of currencies, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; intention is to create core protocols, think of it as HTML/HTTP for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; currencies. Because of this, the answer to any of your specific
</I>&gt;<i> questions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would be &quot;yes&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm not sure that there is a lot of active work going on that is
</I>&gt;<i> specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to meta-currency, there is a loose community of people who have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; working on the ideas. There is a prototype or sorts under the name of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; flowplace (<A HREF="http://flowplace.org">http://flowplace.org</A>) which demonstrates the basics of
</I>&gt;<i> what we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have called the &quot;wealing cycle&quot; (under an analogy that wealth is to
</I>&gt;<i> wealing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; as health is to healing).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The core idea are that there would be openness and transparency
</I>&gt;<i> throughout
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the system, and we identified four domains of oppenness:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1. Open Rules (a language to declare the rules and processing of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; connected group of currencies for a community). The idea is that there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would be a formal language that meta-currency engines could implement.
</I>&gt;<i> We
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have been mostly ruby based, so we have been thinking in terms of ruby
</I>&gt;<i> DSLs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (domain specific languages).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2. Open Identity where we can largely build off of the open identity
</I>&gt;<i> work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that has been done by others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3. Open Transport -- mainly the principle that all participants in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; community of flows can access the raw flows according to standard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; protocols. Implementation of this would be largely using standard web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; protocols (RESTful apis with XML/JSON data)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 4. Open Data -- goes more or less directly with 3 above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You ask great questions and those are exactly the ones that each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; meta-currency community would have to answer for themselves. The whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; point of this effort is that we expect there to be a discovery process
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; where each community has to define what is wealth for them and how to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; measure it and make it visible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm pretty sure that every community will want to build on a similar
</I>&gt;<i> cycle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to the one at FlowPlace where cycles of wealth building declare and
</I>&gt;<i> gather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; around &quot;intentions&quot; and these intentions go through refinement in
</I>&gt;<i> planning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and action phases, then they complete in reflection about what
</I>&gt;<i> happened; an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; acknowledgement of successes and failures and sharing gratitude and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; celebration of what was completed.
