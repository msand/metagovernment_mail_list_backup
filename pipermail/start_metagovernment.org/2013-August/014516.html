<PRE>I hope this doesn't double post, but I got a rejection because my client used the wrong From address from the three that I access with this client.

I'm not going to do a point by point rebuttal of your response to Bentley, but you are way off on just about every point. Email is an insecure and dated platform, and I would not be surprised if it were completely superceded in the next five to ten years. It is extremely relevant to look to how young people interact with digital networks and the current thinking is based in the rise of &quot;social media&quot;. Now, to some extent this is the latest buzzword, but you also cannot deny the power of emerging platforms of Facebook and Twitter.

The problem that I see is that these platforms are branded products of corporations competing to own these spaces. The new civic spaces need to be free of this kind of domination, and that is the bigger issue that must be faced in re-inventing government and finance.

You are right that any limited prototype is not likely to reach the levels of participation to become self-sustaining spaces of collective work, but there already are counter-examples to your claim. Wiki in general as well as blogging platforms as a category are much more significant than email and are the kind of non-branded social media that is essential. Take a look at Wikipedia, many people use it daily and a smaller group collaboratively produce it. Now, I would recommend Wagn over Wiki-media (the platform for Wikipedia and many other community sites) because of the merit of the design, though I can understand if you think I might be biased.

Bringing critical mass to your project is a problem in social architecture, not technical architecture. How is this meta-government effort ever going to go beyond the small network who post here? Email lists have much higher barriers to participation than interactive web-sites. Email has its place (for now), but in the end it is just one of many transport protocols. HTTP is much more powerful and flexible, and RESTful APIs even more so.
