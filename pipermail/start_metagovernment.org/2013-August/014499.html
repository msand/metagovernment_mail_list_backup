<PRE>Hi Alex,

You and I are temporarily both in the same boat: You don't understand 
what somebody is talking about (is that somebody me?), and I don't 
understand what you are talking about.

My email to which your email responded was a long one, and my email was 
a response to three other emails. I am having trouble relating what you 
are saying (and asking) to specific points in those emails.

I stand ready, as always, to respond to your excellent and interesting 
points, but on this occasion I will wait until you give me a bit more 
guidance before doing so ... :^)

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Ed,Harry,Paul, (Great Posts!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     First, for reference, here are the proposed bylaws being discussed:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        * *Bylaw #3: Participation: Through Proposing*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          Members participate in decision making exclusively through
</I>&gt;<i>          formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
</I>&gt;<i>          ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
</I>&gt;<i>          provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
</I>&gt;<i>          making.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        * *Bylaw #4: Decision Rule: No Unresolved Objections*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          The decision rule is that a proposal is cleared to be implemented
</I>&gt;<i>          at the point that it faces no unresolved objections. Objections
</I>&gt;<i>          are proposed. Objections are resolved through successive,
</I>&gt;<i>          recursive proposing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          RESOLVING OBJECTIONS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     An immediate question that arises is: How may objections be resolved?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     One way to resolve objections is to &quot;overwhelm&quot; them with votes,
</I>&gt;<i>     using a majority or super-majority version of the &quot;might makes
</I>&gt;<i>     right&quot; principle. This is currently the /status quo/ method used,
</I>&gt;<i>     globally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My contention is that we can do better than this, in all cases.
</I>&gt;<i>     There are better ways to resolve objections, and it is worth our
</I>&gt;<i>     while to find and adopt those better ways, because using
</I>&gt;<i>     brute-force voting to &quot;resolve&quot; objections (particularly at the
</I>&gt;<i>     scale of large populations) has historically not produced
</I>&gt;<i>     sustainable social systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As an example, an objection that rests on some sort of
</I>&gt;<i>     identifiable logical fallacy (/ad hominem/ argument or whatever)
</I>&gt;<i>     can -- by prior agreement -- be considered to have been resolved
</I>&gt;<i>     at the point that an objection to the objection is proposed, that
</I>&gt;<i>     clearly reveals the logical fallacy. (The objector may still
</I>&gt;<i>     harbor the objection, but the objection will then no longer be
</I>&gt;<i>     able to hold back implementation of the original proposal.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     @Paul: An objection need not be a veto, depending on the methods
</I>&gt;<i>     available to resolve it. I agree with you that the veto system
</I>&gt;<i>     design is not good, because it enables blackmail and because it
</I>&gt;<i>     creates &quot;tyranny of the minority&quot;, just as you suggest. Two of the
</I>&gt;<i>     criteria that &quot;better&quot; methods must meet are that they do not
</I>&gt;<i>     enable either blackmail or tyranny.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     But is the &quot;prior agreement&quot; regarding methods of resolving
</I>&gt;<i>     objections settled by voting? I propose no. For each individual,
</I>&gt;<i>     that prior agreement happens, first, at the point of joining the
</I>&gt;<i>     society. One must agree to the existing methods as a condition of
</I>&gt;<i>     being accepted as a member. Once accepted as a member, one is then
</I>&gt;<i>     free to propose new methods, to object to existing methods, and so
</I>&gt;<i>     on. Through successful proposals, the methods are free to
</I>&gt;<i>     continually evolve and elaborate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As Ed has suggested, if the society starts out using voting as a
</I>&gt;<i>     method, voting would cease to be a method at the point that a
</I>&gt;<i>     proposal to eliminate voting as a method were to successfully pass.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In the beginning (now), there is nothing to prevent the existence
</I>&gt;<i>     of multiple societies, that use differing sets of methods for
</I>&gt;<i>     resolving objections. Over time, the &quot;better&quot; methods will
</I>&gt;<i>     prevail, through the greater progress made by the societies that
</I>&gt;<i>     use them. (Or not.) Our work is to come up with those &quot;better&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     methods, in setting up our own society. Thus, the proposed bylaws.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          CONSENSUAL DEMOCRACY
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Harry, there are potentially a huge number of relevant topics to
</I>&gt;<i>     discuss in the material to which you linked (and throughout your
</I>&gt;<i>     website). (I very much hope that we do discuss those topics.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Harry&gt; Essentially, in my view, it is impractical, in a
</I>&gt;<i>     democractic
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        debate to aim for genuine consensus. (the complete absence of
</I>&gt;<i>        dissent) That is a recipe for decision making paralysis.
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; My impression is that we all agree with this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In Bylaw #4, &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; is not synonymous with
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;complete absence of dissent&quot;. There may be any number of ways to
</I>&gt;<i>     resolve objections that will leave the objectors still dissenting.
</I>&gt;<i>     Decision by super-majority voting outcome is one example of such a
</I>&gt;<i>     method. Pointing to flaws in the logic of the proposal is another.
</I>&gt;<i>     Pointing to evidence against assertions of fact in the proposal is
</I>&gt;<i>     another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Harry&gt; What is practical is to afford priveleged status to dissent
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        and to insist that dissenting arguments are a) given full coverage
</I>&gt;<i>        and b) given full and proper answers, preferably to the
</I>&gt;<i>     satisfaction
</I>&gt;<i>        of the dissenter but at least to the satisfaction of the vast
</I>&gt;<i>        majority of those taking part in the debate. (my preferred
</I>&gt;<i>        &quot;majority&quot; is at least 80, preferably 90%) and only when a
</I>&gt;<i>        dissenting objection is agreed by that majority to have been
</I>&gt;<i>        satisfactorily answered, can the debated move on.
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I do not agree that we should accord greater status to
</I>&gt;<i>     super-majorities or treat them in other ways more favorably than
</I>&gt;<i>     minorities or individuals. I do not find such favoritism to be
</I>&gt;<i>     acceptable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I trust decision making through discourse more than I trust
</I>&gt;<i>     decision making through voting. (Sometimes discourse fails; my
</I>&gt;<i>     impression is that voting fails more often, and more seriously,
</I>&gt;<i>     from the perspective of survival of the species and such.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My view is that even super-majorities should have to present their
</I>&gt;<i>     reasons through discourse, and those reasons should need to be
</I>&gt;<i>     able to survive criticism and systematic examination in order to
</I>&gt;<i>     become effective. When a super-majority finds itself &quot;satisfied&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     I want to be presented with an account of the basis for that
</I>&gt;<i>     satisfaction, and have opportunity to rebut. Otherwise we have
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;tyranny of the super-majority&quot;, which is just another form of
</I>&gt;<i>     tyranny.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Harry&gt; ... the only way we can &quot;objectify&quot; subjective opinion is to
</I>&gt;<i>        measure it. The only fair way to treat the results of such
</I>&gt;<i>        measurement is to give them equal weight, regardless of how each
</I>&gt;<i>        opinion was arrived at.
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Another way to &quot;objectify&quot; subjective opinion is to verbally
</I>&gt;<i>     express it, in discourse, and have it become an element of the
</I>&gt;<i>     discourse. Yes? If all participants in the discourse participate
</I>&gt;<i>     on equal footing, the process is fair. I don't see voting and
</I>&gt;<i>     counting votes as the only means, or the best means, through which
</I>&gt;<i>     objectification and detecting decisive resolution can be
</I>&gt;<i>     accomplished fairly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (Side note: I like your flowchart, but I confess that I like mine
</I>&gt;<i>     better. If you find the project of interest and want to take the
</I>&gt;<i>     time, I would be very interested to read why you do not like mine
</I>&gt;<i>     better also, if you do not:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          VOTING VERSUS PROPOSING
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Ed&gt; I'm not sure I see as clear of a distinction between voting
</I>&gt;<i>     and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        recursive proposing. Most Metagov projects are not about up/down
</I>&gt;<i>        votes, but rather using voting to help drive recursive proposing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; When you say voting drives proposing, you seem to be
</I>&gt;<i>     distinguishing just fine: a vote is a vote, and a proposal is a
</I>&gt;<i>     proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Ed&gt; In the development of that Rules page I previously linked to,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        for example, Thomas and I came up with very similar proposals. One
</I>&gt;<i>        was a slight refinement of the other, and won out in the end. There
</I>&gt;<i>        were numerous proposals beforehand. The voting was to help everyone
</I>&gt;<i>        understand each person's stand on the status of proposals. When I
</I>&gt;<i>        shifted my vote to Thomas, we had unanimity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Casting a vote does indeed reveal the person's stand on the
</I>&gt;<i>     matter at hand. What casting a vote does not do is reveal the
</I>&gt;<i>     reasons for the person's stand. A proposal (that responds to
</I>&gt;<i>     another proposal) reveals both the stand and the reasons for the
</I>&gt;<i>     stand. This makes the proposal-in-response potentially much more
</I>&gt;<i>     useful than &quot;just a vote&quot; to others, and to the process of seeking
</I>&gt;<i>     synthesis and consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Ed&gt; (Others decided to simply delegate. This wasn't just an
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        abstaining from decision-making. It was saying that they wanted to
</I>&gt;<i>        contribute to the quorum of participants, but they trusted
</I>&gt;<i>     others to
</I>&gt;<i>        spend more time and energy on the issue than themselves.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Another thing that the delegation accomplished was to make
</I>&gt;<i>     the decision-making power of some individuals more equal than the
</I>&gt;<i>     decision-making power of other individuals. Any arrangement that
</I>&gt;<i>     has this effect is fundamentally anti-democratic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Ed&gt; I do have an issue with requiring effective unanimity (no
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        unresolved objections) as a definition of consensus. Look at the
</I>&gt;<i>        parallel thread on this list. Mark appears to be coming from a
</I>&gt;<i>        completely different angle than other recent participants on this
</I>&gt;<i>        list. Do you think you can raise any proposal he wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i>     object to?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Actually, Mark is not the one objecting to my proposals. You
</I>&gt;<i>     are. :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Without meaning to put words in Mark's mouth, his objection to
</I>&gt;<i>     proposals on the basis that the proposers may be freemasons is a
</I>&gt;<i>     pretty good example of an objection that can be resolved (by
</I>&gt;<i>     pointing to its /ad hominem/ basis) without seeking or achieving
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;effective unanimity&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Voting is one method through which objections can be resolved
</I>&gt;<i>     without achieving effective unanimity, but not the only such
</I>&gt;<i>     method by any means. We just need to reach agreement concerning
</I>&gt;<i>     which such methods we will recognize and utilize in our decision
</I>&gt;<i>     making process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Ed&gt; More broadly, my point was that a surprisingly large
</I>&gt;<i>     percentage
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        of humans are sociopathic, and quite a lot more are insane in other
</I>&gt;<i>        ways. I don't want to disenfranchise them, but they certainly could
</I>&gt;<i>        stop any proposal for any (or no particular) reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Only if we let them, by being so silly as to adopt a veto
</I>&gt;<i>     system. You appear to be claiming that voting (with a popularity
</I>&gt;<i>     decision rule of less than 96% or whatever) is the ONLY way that
</I>&gt;<i>     we can avoid having sociopaths run roughshod over us. Do you
</I>&gt;<i>     really think that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Ed&gt; For society to function as a group, there has to be some
</I>&gt;<i>     cutoff
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        where enough is enough. Such a rule will not result in perfection,
</I>&gt;<i>        but on the other hand, striving for perfection just isn't going to
</I>&gt;<i>        translate to success in the real world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; At the scale of large populations, popular voting has not
</I>&gt;<i>     succeeded in the real world. Vote-powered democracies in the past
</I>&gt;<i>     have not endured, and those in the present day are tottering. I
</I>&gt;<i>     propose that we give proposing a try, as an alternative basis for
</I>&gt;<i>     democratic decision making. (I agree that perfection will not be
</I>&gt;<i>     the result, but I like the survival odds of the basis better.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If we do use proposing rather than voting as the basis, the
</I>&gt;<i>     cutoffs will have to do with the content of proposals, not with
</I>&gt;<i>     the popularity of proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Ed&gt; Even more broadly, other people are genuine authoritarians.
</I>&gt;<i>     They
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        are the one group I don't see having a major role in Metagov,
</I>&gt;<i>        because their philosophy is inherently contradictory to ours. I'm
</I>&gt;<i>        leery of allowing a single authoritarian to quash every single
</I>&gt;<i>        proposal anyone makes in this group.

</I>&gt;<i>         couple of things to note. First, if you choose to visit,
</I>&gt;<i>         please ignore
</I>&gt;<i>         the &quot;invalid certificate&quot; warnings and add an exception. I've
</I>&gt;<i>         instituted
</I>&gt;<i>         https to increase privacy (makes it harder for the snoops to
</I>&gt;<i>         learn what
</I>&gt;<i>         you're visiting online) but I can't be arsed to pay for a
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;legitimate&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         certificate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Second, it's a long post, so if you're not particularly
</I>&gt;<i>         interested in
</I>&gt;<i>         the debate I was having with &quot;the Prof&quot; over the merits of
</I>&gt;<i>         democracy,
</I>&gt;<i>         search for
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;5 Prioritise Dissent&quot;. That'll take you straight to my proposed
</I>&gt;<i>         algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Essentially, in my view, it is impractical, in a democractic
</I>&gt;<i>         debate to
</I>&gt;<i>         aim for genuine consensus. (the complete absence of dissent)
</I>&gt;<i>         That is a
</I>&gt;<i>         recipe for decision making paralysis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         What is practical is to afford priveleged status to dissent and to
</I>&gt;<i>         insist that dissenting arguments are a) given full coverage
</I>&gt;<i>         and b) given
</I>&gt;<i>         full and proper answers, preferably to the satisfaction of the
</I>&gt;<i>         dissenter
</I>&gt;<i>         but at least to the satisfaction of the vast majority of those
</I>&gt;<i>         taking
</I>&gt;<i>         part in the debate. (my preferred &quot;majority&quot; is at least 80,
</I>&gt;<i>         preferably
</I>&gt;<i>         90%) and only when a dissenting objection is agreed by that
</I>&gt;<i>         majority to
</I>&gt;<i>         have been satisfactorily answered, can the debated move on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Another extremely important part of the solution to the
</I>&gt;<i>         consensus issue
</I>&gt;<i>         is the target of &quot;Pareto Efficiency&quot; - the notion that no
</I>&gt;<i>         decision is
</I>&gt;<i>         valid unless we can ensure that there are no losers and that
</I>&gt;<i>         at least
</I>&gt;<i>         one person gains. In the case of dissent based on prospective
</I>&gt;<i>         loss, this
</I>&gt;<i>         implies that the majority are obliged to compensate the dissenting
</I>&gt;<i>         minority for any losses they incur as a result of the decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         If Pareto Efficiency is not possible (loss is unavoidable, for
</I>&gt;<i>         example,
</I>&gt;<i>         because the global economy has collapsed!) then the rule is
</I>&gt;<i>         modified so
</I>&gt;<i>         that all losses are shared proportionately to the ability to
</I>&gt;<i>         sustain
</I>&gt;<i>         loss.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Hope this is on topic and helps the debate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Cheers

</I>&gt;<i>             One was a
</I>&gt;<i>             slight refinement of the other, and won out in the end.
</I>&gt;<i>             There were
</I>&gt;<i>             numerous proposals beforehand. The voting was to help everyone
</I>&gt;<i>             understand each person's stand on the status of proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>             When I
</I>&gt;<i>             shifted my vote to Thomas, we had unanimity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             (Others decided to simply delegate. This wasn't just an
</I>&gt;<i>             abstaining
</I>&gt;<i>             from decision-making. It was saying that they wanted to

</I>&gt;<i>             spend more time
</I>&gt;<i>             and energy on the issue than themselves.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I do have an issue with requiring effective unanimity (no
</I>&gt;<i>             unresolved
</I>&gt;<i>             objections) as a definition of consensus. Look at the
</I>&gt;<i>             parallel thread

</I>&gt;<i>             different

</I>&gt;<i>             think you
</I>&gt;<i>             can raise any proposal he wouldn't object to?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             More broadly, my point was that a surprisingly large
</I>&gt;<i>             percentage of
</I>&gt;<i>             humans are sociopathic, and quite a lot more are insane in
</I>&gt;<i>             other ways.
</I>&gt;<i>             I don't want to disenfranchise them, but they certainly
</I>&gt;<i>             could stop any
</I>&gt;<i>             proposal for any (or no particular) reason. For society to
</I>&gt;<i>             function as
</I>&gt;<i>             a group, there has to be some cutoff where enough is
</I>&gt;<i>             enough. Such a
</I>&gt;<i>             rule will not result in perfection, but on the other hand,
</I>&gt;<i>             striving
</I>&gt;<i>             for perfection just isn't going to translate to success in
</I>&gt;<i>             the real
</I>&gt;<i>             world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Even more broadly, other people are genuine
</I>&gt;<i>             authoritarians. They are
</I>&gt;<i>             the one group I don't see having a major role in Metagov,

</I>&gt;<i>                   &quot;Communicative rationality&quot; is communication that is

</I>&gt;<i>                 Historically, decisions made by the muddy middle

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 Moreover, the sociopaths are much more adept at

</I>&gt;<i>                 to not have any naked voting at all as a formal
</I>&gt;<i>                 technique of decision making.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 To use a bad analogy, you want people to be free to

</I>&gt;<i>                             The organization I am talking about would
</I>&gt;<i>                             be an American non-profit corporation. It
</I>&gt;<i>                             would be subservient to this group, but
</I>&gt;<i>                             would be organized under United States law
</I>&gt;<i>                             so that it could be eligible for grants
</I>&gt;<i>                             from foundations. For that purpose, the
</I>&gt;<i>                             bylaws need to be a document that shows
</I>&gt;<i>                             the IRS and the foundations that it is a
</I>&gt;<i>                             responsible organization -- and by
</I>&gt;<i>                             responsible, they mean that money is
</I>&gt;<i>                             managed responsibly and that someone will
</I>&gt;<i>                             be held to account if it is mismanaged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                             Here's an example of US nonprofit org bylaws:
</I>&gt;<i>                             <A HREF="http://form1023.org/how-to-draft-nonprofit-bylaws-with-examples">http://form1023.org/how-to-draft-nonprofit-bylaws-with-examples</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                             I am planning on engaging legal advice to
</I>&gt;<i>                             help in drafting our bylaws in such a way
</I>&gt;<i>                             that they can make the IRS and the
</I>&gt;<i>                             foundations happy but also not violate our
</I>&gt;<i>                             principles. That's going to be very
</I>&gt;<i>                             difficult, but if it can be done, there is
</I>&gt;<i>                             a great side-benefit in that we'll be
</I>&gt;<i>                             creating a model for other organizations
</I>&gt;<i>                             to start up using collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                             The bylaws you draft below would be more
</I>&gt;<i>                             for the global group, right? I just want
</I>&gt;<i>                             to point out that we have two other
</I>&gt;<i>                             branches that overlap with what you're
</I>&gt;<i>                             presenting:

</I>&gt;<i>                             For adding on another layer as you
</I>&gt;<i>                             propose, I think it may be helpful to
</I>&gt;<i>                             address each of your points below in a
</I>&gt;<i>                             separate conversation. There's a lot of
</I>&gt;<i>                             weighty stuff there, and each point should
</I>&gt;<i>                             probably be examined by the group.
