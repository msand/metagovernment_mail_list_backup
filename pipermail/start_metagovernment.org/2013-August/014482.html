<PRE>Sorry if you want to leave, Mark, but I don't see where your criticism is coming from. The only things that are firmly decided here are that:
1. Governance should be open to everyone, without exception
2. Information related to governance should be free and open

The rest is up for debate/discussion. That's the purpose of this list.

</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; The Rules page is strictly about modification of the Wiki (or
</I>&gt;<i>    more precisely, of the home page). It's purpose was to be a test
</I>&gt;<i>    case for expanding out to a larger scope (e.g., the bylaws you propose).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Understood. (Which is why you suggested that the Rules page would be a good foil for discussing the proposed bylaws.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; The decision rule there is set up to be 100% for small groups
</I>&gt;<i>    and to gradually decrease down toward 80% as the group gets larger
</I>&gt;<i>    (though that 80% standard can be tweaked). Yes, this is in
</I>&gt;<i>    opposition to your suggestion of no unresolved objections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The difference in methods is much more fundamental and far reaching than a difference between 80% and 100%. The method on the Rules page uses voting (popularity) to make decisions. The bylaws propose using successive recursive proposing (discourse) to make decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bylaw #3 specifies that voting (popularity) will not be used at all in making decisions. The number of people in favor of or against a proposal will not affect the decision, so there is really no point in even counting how many are in favor and how many are opposed. There is no XX% decision-rule. The popularity of the proposal does not determine the decision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;Communicative rationality&quot; is communication that is &quot;oriented to
</I>&gt;<i>    achieving, sustaining and reviewing consensus -- and indeed a
</I>&gt;<i>    consensus that rests on the intersubjective recognition of
</I>&gt;<i>    criticisable validity claims&quot;. A proposal constitutes such
</I>&gt;<i>    communication. A &quot;naked vote&quot; does not constitute such communication.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    A proposal submits itself to criticism and systematic examination
</I>&gt;<i>    through discourse. A proposal presents good reasons to implement the
</I>&gt;<i>    proposal, or at least promises that good reasons exist and could be
</I>&gt;<i>    requested. Even in the case that the proposal springs from a
</I>&gt;<i>    subjective preference, the subjective preference is publicly
</I>&gt;<i>    revealed, and may through discourse be counter-balanced, or balanced
</I>&gt;<i>    in relation to wider consequences.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    A &quot;naked vote&quot; responds to a proposal without itself being a
</I>&gt;<i>    proposal. It has no rational discourse clothes on. It expresses a
</I>&gt;<i>    preference without presenting or promising reasons for that
</I>&gt;<i>    preference. It does not submit itself to criticism and systematic
</I>&gt;<i>    examination. It cannot effectively be challenged through rational
</I>&gt;<i>    discourse, since it is but a raw, naked, inarticulate &quot;grunt&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i>    preference, that has its effect simply through being counted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Hereafter, when I say &quot;vote&quot; I mean &quot;naked vote&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; I do support consensus decision-making, but as Pietro noted much
</I>&gt;<i>    earlier, psychologists estimate that 1% to 4% of people are sociopaths.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Four percent of the population are sociopaths, and four percent are &quot;the wisest of the wise&quot;, who have knowledge and understanding and good will deep enough to enable them to create proposals that can make the world wonderful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using voting (popularity) as the basis for decisions cuts off both of these extremes, with the result that decisions are made by the &quot;muddy middle&quot; of the bell-shaped curve of understanding and good will. Historically, decisions made by the muddy middle (through voting) have not produced sustainable societies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, the sociopaths are much more adept at manipulating that muddy middle than are the wisest of the wise. (The sociopaths will do anything; the wise respect the free will of others, and are bound by scruples.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The best way to disempower the sociopaths is to have a decision system that allows anyone in the population to propose objections to their nefarious proposals. Nefarious proposals have difficulty surviving transparent rational discourse. Nefarious proposals have a much easier time winning propaganda-driven popularity contests, decided by voters who generally have only superficial understanding of the issues and are too busy to pay more than a few minutes of attention.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; Making a 100% decision-rule for large-scale governance might be
</I>&gt;<i>    quite impractical.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; If the measure of &quot;practical&quot; is taken to be social system sustainability, then naked voting (using any decision-rule) has historically shown itself to be impractical: 50% and 80% and 100% decision-rules are all impractical, in the sense that they routinely produce decisions that are not practical from the perspective of sustainability.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Everybody agrees&quot; is not the same as &quot;nobody objects&quot;. Bylaws #3 and #4 are not proposing that a 100% decision-rule be used. They are proposing that we abandon voting (popularity) as the basis for public decision making altogether, and switch to using proposing (discourse) as the basis for public decision making. When proposing is used as the basis, there is no popularity decision-rule.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; We landed on 80% as an &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; and a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i>    standard for consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; There is nothing reasonable about super-majority rule. There is nothing reasonable about naked voting. Naked voting empowers the largest sufficiently large group to dictate to all individuals of the society (overriding their autonomy), with that group power unrestrained by communicative rationality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; is not consensus. &quot;Overwhelming&quot; is a power move, that is the opposite of reaching consensus, and that truncates the process of reaching consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; But it can be changed by, well, 80% of the people deciding it
</I>&gt;<i>    should be changed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I agree. At the point that 80% of any population has understood that naked voting too often produces not-good-enough decisions (from the perspective of humanity, nature, and future generations), there will be one last vote, on the proposal to abandon voting (popularity) and switch to proposing (discourse) as the basis for decision making.   :^)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; Concerning how votes/participation should be cast, I am leery of
</I>&gt;<i>    specifying one technique.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Here you appear to be talking about different kinds of naked votes, and different techniques for casting naked votes, and different algorithms for counting naked votes. But what the bylaws propose is to not have any naked voting at all as a formal technique of decision making.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To use a bad analogy, you want people to be free to use any swimming stroke they want, while I am proposing that we climb out of the swimming pool. Once out of the pool, no one will be swimming, using any stroke. Decision making through successive recursive proposing is qualitatively different than decision making through naked voting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; Different member groups do it differently. You may like your way
</I>&gt;<i>    better, but they may not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I do like my way better, and they do like their ways better. Starting from that scattered state, if we can manage to work through our differences and reach consensus, we will be more able to potentially make the world better (world peace, abundance for all, environment protected, greater personal and public autonomy, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can accomplish more if we work together. Diversity in decision making methods is nice, but making good progress toward solving the world's biggest and most pressing problems would be even nicer. People are starving while we play in our separate sandboxes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; The point of free-range voting is to allow people to participate
</I>&gt;<i>    in the way they are most comfortable, which should then be
</I>&gt;<i>    accommodating of whatever technique any system wants to use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I fully understand that naked voting is the /status quo/, and that the burden of persuasion rests on those (such as myself) who advocate moving away from the comfort of the /status quo/.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Casting a naked vote is easy and comfortable. Comparatively, engaging in discourse is hard, and often uncomfortable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; What do you see as wrong with &quot;naked voting?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Great Question!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    * Proposing can produce better decisions more reliably than voting.
</I>&gt;<i>    * Proposing can produce those better decisions more efficiently than
</I>&gt;<i>      voting.
</I>&gt;<i>    * Proposing can provide greater public autonomy to each individual
</I>&gt;<i>      than voting.
</I>&gt;<i>    * Proposing can protect the interests of absentee stakeholders more
</I>&gt;<i>      reliably than voting.
</I>&gt;<i>    * Proposing can diffuse power more reliably and appropriately than
</I>&gt;<i>      voting.
</I>&gt;<i>    * Proposing can be more transparent than voting.
</I>&gt;<i>    * Proposing can scale better than voting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; In a well-crafted environment, isn't a naked vote really the
</I>&gt;<i>    same as proposing the same thing as what someone else has already
</I>&gt;<i>    proposed?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Why would anyone want to propose again a proposal that has already been proposed? Any particular proposal only needs to be proposed once.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; Instead of re-proposing their exact text, one can just +1 it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The idea is to have each proposal pass or fail based on whether it can survive criticism and systematic examination through discourse. It is a bad idea to have each proposal pass or fail based upon its popularity among people who spend six seconds reading the title and then decide whether to click the &quot;+1&quot; button.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; Could you view that as a translating technique between naked
</I>&gt;<i>    voting and proposing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; No. There is no translating technique between naked voting and proposing. The terms are defined as being exclusive alternatives, like &quot;swimming&quot; and &quot;walking&quot;. The contexts of the techniques differ. The techniques themselves are qualitatively different.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Proposing happens within the context of discourse. Naked voting (by definition) happens outside of the context of discourse. The vote has its effect through being counted, not through being presented in discourse to others who may respond and challenge it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In this email exchange, you and I are engaging in discourse (each email a proposal). Discourse is hard work, and often not comfortable. It can produce feelings of frustration, anger, discouragement, all-of-above and more. But discourse is the highest and surest path that we have available to reach full synthesis and consensus. Making a decision through voting truncates traveling that path to completion.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes! I wholeheartedly agree: there is lots of overlap, and each point &quot;should&quot; be examined by the group. (But I don't quite understand what you mean by &quot;adding on another layer&quot; ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The relations of the proposed bylaws to the material of the &quot;Mission and Vision&quot; page are complex, but mostly the points of the two proposals seem (to me) to be compatible. (If you see conflicts, by all means point them out.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, bylaws #3 and #4 stand in direct opposition to the decision method of the &quot;Rules&quot; page. That might be a good place to start. What problems do you have with switching from &quot;naked voting&quot; to proposing as the means through which individuals participate in decision making?

For that purpose, the bylaws need to be a document that shows the IRS and the foundations that it is a responsible organization -- and by responsible, they mean that money is managed responsibly and that someone will be held to account if it is mismanaged.

</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   1. *MEMBERSHIP: UNCOERCED*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Any sentient being (globally) may freely choose to become a member
</I>&gt;<i>      of the society. Any member may freely choose to cease to be a
</I>&gt;<i>      member of the society.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   2. *DECISION MAKING: DIRECT DEMOCRACY*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Each member of the society is free to participate in making any
</I>&gt;<i>      decision that the society makes. Each member participates in
</I>&gt;<i>      decision making on equal footing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Emergency decisions are made through a subordinate emergency
</I>&gt;<i>      response system. Any member may participate in the post-emergency
</I>&gt;<i>      reviews of decisions made during emergencies.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   3. *PARTICIPATION: THROUGH PROPOSING*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Members participate in decision making exclusively through
</I>&gt;<i>      formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
</I>&gt;<i>      ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
</I>&gt;<i>      provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
</I>&gt;<i>      making.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   4. *DECISION RULE: NO UNRESOLVED OBJECTIONS
</I>&gt;<i>      *
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The decision rule is that a proposal is cleared to be implemented
</I>&gt;<i>      at the point that it faces no unresolved objections. Objections
</I>&gt;<i>      are proposed. Objections are resolved through successive,
</I>&gt;<i>      recursive proposing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   5. *NOTIFICATION: PROPOSAL PROFILES, PROPOSAL MAGNETS*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Effecting direct democracy at the scale of the global population
</I>&gt;<i>      requires that the decision system have an affordable sub-system
</I>&gt;<i>      that reliably notifies each member of new proposals that may be of
</I>&gt;<i>      interest, and that avoids inundating individuals with new
</I>&gt;<i>      proposals not of interest. The details of the software and
</I>&gt;<i>      practices that will together effect efficient and reliable global
</I>&gt;<i>      notification will be co-created and evolved through successive
</I>&gt;<i>      successful proposing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   6. *APPLYING PAST DECISIONS: APPRAISAL*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      In order for the decision system to be affordable and reliable at
</I>&gt;<i>      the scale of the global population, it must have a sub-system that
</I>&gt;<i>      efficiently and reliably applies all relevant past decisions to
</I>&gt;<i>      each new proposal that is submitted. (The past decisions serve as
</I>&gt;<i>      filters; each new proposal must successfully &quot;pass through&quot; all
</I>&gt;<i>      such filters in order to be cleared for implementation.) The
</I>&gt;<i>      details of the software and practices that will together effect
</I>&gt;<i>      this will be co-created and evolved through successive successful
</I>&gt;<i>      proposing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   7. *AMENDMENTS: THROUGH PROPOSING*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Additions and amendments to these bylaws may be effected through
</I>&gt;<i>      successfully proposing.
