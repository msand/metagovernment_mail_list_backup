<PRE>Hi Paul and Alex,

Paul, thanks for the link to the CESJ material -- good stuff!

Alex, I very much agree with you that social arrangements that maintain 
and increase concentration of wealth/power are problems to be solved.

To the extent that a particular corporation &quot;succeeds&quot; (from the 
perspective of its owners), wealth/power are concentrated (in the 
corporation, and in the owners of the corporation). This is not a 
problem from the perspective of the corporation, but is a problem from 
the perspective of the rest of humanity, and nature, and future generations.

I don't quite understand what leads you think that tinkering with the 
rules of equity (within corporations) will solve the problems that 
corporations keep causing for the world as a whole (poverty, war, 
environmental destruction, etc.). Each corporation will still be 
narrowly pursuing its own interests, with the rest of us having no 
choice but to continue trusting &quot;The Invisible Hand&quot; to protect the rest 
of us from corporate predations. (We have been trusting The Invisible 
Hand for the last few hundred years, and things have not been going so 
well ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; I think, because people are not used to this, it's not easy to
    sell the idea and people will be very sceptical in the beginning.

It is pretty easy to predict that the people who will most skeptical 
will be the richest people in the world. Any particular startup can 
indeed choose to &quot;spread the wealth&quot; internally, but then the richest 
people will back competitors to the startup that give them better equity 
deals, and will instruct their captured politicians and regulators to 
make trouble for any startup that presumes to try to &quot;spread the wealth&quot;.

As Paul suggested, &quot;binary economics&quot; presents arrangements that are 
very close to what you are suggesting. The CESJ organization (that has 
been promulgating binary economics) has been in business since 1984, as 
yet without much success (you and I had never even heard of them). If 
you want &quot;real effects NOW&quot;, starting with trying to change the rules of 
equity within corporations may not be the best choice. The attempt would 
be unlikely to succeed against the opposition of the richest people in 
the world, and even if it did succeed, the world would still be at the 
mercy of successful corporations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; But there's also the problems of how people will decide,
    because if there is many shareholders, the problem of how to
    establish good democratic pratices supported by the proper tools,
    follows immediately.

YES! My view is that in order to really solve &quot;the problems of 
concentrated power&quot;, we need to create, demonstrate, and popularize a 
full direct democracy, that is capable of rendering corporations 
obsolete, globally. (Because people are not used to this, it's not easy 
to sell the idea and people will be very skeptical in the beginning ...) :^)

In order to decide to change the rules of equity, or the rules of money, 
or any other rules, we need a new decision system through which to 
decide such things. That has to come first. We need to decide, together, 
how we are going to decide.

(&quot;We&quot; means you and me and Paul and Stephen and Conseo and Ed and Pietro 
and Mike and the other members of the Metagovernment community and then 
others in the broader e-dem population, and so on. We talk about the 
importance of starting at the community level, but then we don't do it.)

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Alex,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It seems that you have the makings for starting a startup: a
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;founder team&quot; that offers the service of setting up other new
</I>&gt;<i>     startups in the manner you suggest. The success of those other
</I>&gt;<i>     startups that used your arrangements and practices would then
</I>&gt;<i>     provide validation of the arrangements and practices, at least
</I>&gt;<i>     from the perspective of each startup (though not necessarily from
</I>&gt;<i>     the perspective of society as a whole, or nature, or future
</I>&gt;<i>     generations).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I went through what you wrote and tried to pick out the problems
</I>&gt;<i>     that you are trying to solve. Here is what I came up with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * The richest keep becoming richer because they can sit back
</I>&gt;<i>           and let the structure work for them once they have invested.
</I>&gt;<i>         * To not let them sit back, there needs to be a &quot;social
</I>&gt;<i>           process&quot; within the startup of constantly evaluating results
</I>&gt;<i>           to measure progress.
</I>&gt;<i>         * Given such an internal process, it is then possible to
</I>&gt;<i>           arrange that shares can &quot;waste away&quot; if the shareholder is
</I>&gt;<i>           not continually doing work to help the startup.
</I>&gt;<i>         * This would in turn enable everyone in the startup to be a
</I>&gt;<i>           shareholder (creating and maintaining shareholdings through
</I>&gt;<i>           working), so that compensation would be in the form of a
</I>&gt;<i>           dividend paid to shares held, rather than in the form of
</I>&gt;<i>           wages or salaries.
</I>&gt;<i>         * In such a system, the richest (initial investors) would no
</I>&gt;<i>           longer have a free ride forever after the initial
</I>&gt;<i>           investment, which would be fairer, and would over time
</I>&gt;<i>           spread wealth away from the richest toward those who
</I>&gt;<i>           actually do the work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Have I correctly understood the essence of what you are trying to
</I>&gt;<i>     accomplish?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Whats a common practice or topic you have to get into when you

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     You pay wages, you get shares, and often there are &quot;founder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     teams&quot;, so they craft a company or partner agreement in which,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     amongst other things, document:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - who gets how many shares?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - how many shares do external investors get?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - how might be able to vote to which degree?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - if an investor/partner leaves, will he lose his shares? can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     they be bought back?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (think of facebook and the programer who helped zuckerberg in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     early stages)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - do partners have to earn there shares? (so called VESTING)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ...so essentially, there is a lot of custom rules or best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     practices, like (tag along, drag along
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag-along_right">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag-along_right</A>) ... which are just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     set up to make sure what happens to EQUITY at any point in time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *NOW WHAT?*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Something that i believe to be essential in order for an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     alternative approach to work, is a &quot;social process&quot; of constantly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     evaluating results to measure progress from day one and have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     lot of transpareceny (for example: in a startup)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     _3 Techniques which are already best practices in their domain_
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *TECHNIQUE 1*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     There is a method called &quot;Business Model Canvas&quot;, which is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     top-down-view of a startup which you draw on a canvas with your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     team (could also be done digitally).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Then you attach hypotheses and their tests (todo's for the team)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to every area of the company (partners, (activities+ressources),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     product, (channels, relations) customers) and work through them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     during the next week.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     So you ITERATE through this process generating business model
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     canvas after business model canvas, making progress visible, + it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     helps to not lose focus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *TECHNIQUE 2*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     There is a methodology called &quot;agile management technique&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     one of them is called scrum. Most software developers should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     familiar with it. Within scum, there is a technique called
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;PLANNING POKER&quot; which is some kind of card game you run through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     before each 2-week-sprint-iteration (which means 2 weeks of doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     work) to upfront try to estimate how many tasks you could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     accomplish from an priorityqueue of features/tasks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *TECHNIQUE 3*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Financial Bookkeeping and Depreciation. Where many &quot;accounts&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     exists and you update them for each business transaction and you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     also calculate the depreciation over time, so you know your &quot;true
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     costs&quot; because you have to bear &quot;replacement investments&quot; in mind.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Now if you use all those 3 techniques, you will eventually end up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     with a process, where a digital business model canvas can give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     transparencey to all participants about the current state of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     company. Combined with the Planning Poker Approach, its possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to measure progress or do some kind of bookkeeping or point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     system, where you measure how much all your points are worth and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     after each iteration you could reevaluate in retrospective to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     what degree your assumptions became true and this practice will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     sharpen everyones ability to make such guesses (learning process).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Now if you also account for depreciation (some todo's, like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     results of &quot;a customer interview&quot; or &quot;cleaning a room&quot; will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     depreciate faster than a bought &quot;office table&quot;), you could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     calculate an average rate of depreciation with which earned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     points waste away.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Then there is also those points who have to be &quot;written off&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     after you did some kind of work which turned out to be a waste of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     time.... ...but the process of this is weaved into the CORE
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     TECHNIQUE (with business model canvas) around which you build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     everything else and which helps you to keep focus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *What does it mean? And how is this related to the &quot;STATUS QUO&quot;?*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     1. Now, what if i buy an office chair and give it &quot;points&quot; during
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     a weekly planning poker session? The &quot;office chair&quot; also has a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     value in &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot;. If many companies will do this approach,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     you essentially get an &quot;exchange rate&quot; between your companies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     internal point system and &quot;USD&quot; or &quot;EUR&quot; and the like.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     2. What if this process works well, why not make these points
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     REAL SHARES? And if you do so, why not make everyones SHARES
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     waste away with the average rate of depreciation, so that people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     have to re-invest, in order to not lose all their shares over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     time? (=&gt; This will essentially make all this equity agreements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     or &quot;VESTING&quot; rules kind of superfluous, because if someone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     decides to quit and doesnt want to sell his shares, they will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     waste away over time)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Why should I invest work in earning shares if they waste away???
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Because as long as you have shares, they decide on a potentially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;real time basis&quot; how much of the companies revenue (in USD or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     EUR or the like...) goes into your pocket. So you dont work for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     wage, but for those points which eventually are shares and which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     will decide your monetary income flow (potentially minutely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     dividends)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     IF this techniques, which in practice should make the average
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     person better off, becomes mainstream practice (which is totally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     possible, because if there are role models who work this way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     successfully, it will spread virally, because it will mean more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     money and more power with less work for everyone beside the top
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     1%, but it has to start bottom-up and success of practicioners
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     will automatically spread it and make it a mainstream practice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ... THEN: shareholders will lose equity over time to those who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     are actively doing the work, which makes the rules fair again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     And because everyone or every company will create their &quot;point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     system&quot; which will end up having an exchange rate in EUR/USD,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     they all get used to this and it will or might lay a foundation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to tackle the monetary system as such, but for now, this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     totally of reach.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             now and have a couple of arguments why i think that to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             true which i dont want to get into now, but i think its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             totally possible to tackle the equity issue and i believe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             with the equity issue tackled, the money issue will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             follow by itself sooner or later.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Does this topic somehow sound interesting? If so, i would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             really like to get into the details, but if there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             nobody on this list who is interested in these topics, i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             dont want to waste your time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             kind regards
