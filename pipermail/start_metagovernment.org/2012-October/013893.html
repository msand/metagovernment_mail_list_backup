<PRE>&gt;<i> what should the next topic be....Suggestions?
</I>
I've been pretty much on the sidelines in MG because my own project doesn't
quite fit with Metagovernment, yet it is related enough that sometimes I
pick up ideas from the conversation here.  Perhaps I am not the only one
with an outlying project and we could have a session to bring in these
semi-related ideas and projects with a short presentation for each.

Briefly, the InterMix Voices of Humanity Project &lt;<A HREF="http://intermix.org">http://intermix.org</A>&gt; is
aimed at getting the NGO world onto the same page.  The building block is
groups.  Individuals participate through groups to write, read and rate
messages.  Highly rated messages are automatically tweeted and facebooked
as the &quot;voice&quot; of the group.  Groups participate together in &quot;discussions&quot;
which can have &quot;decision periods&quot;.  Within a decision period, each
participating group has its own voice, ie, winning message, but the twist
that makes InterMix truly different is that the software automatically
recombines the participants into demographically related &quot;voices&quot;.  For
starters, we are using gender and a simple age breakdown to create six
&quot;Voices of Humanity&quot;: the Voice of Women, Voice of Men, Voice of Youth,
Voice of Experience (middle aged), Voice of Wisdom (seniors) and the Voice
of Humanity as One.

Although we call the voting periods that can occur within a discussion
&quot;decisions&quot; and there is a winning message for each group and demographic
group, the decision process will not be useful for creating law.  It is too
wide open.  A poem might win, for instance.  What I am hoping InterMix will
be good for is to build a sense of solidarity across the many divisions in
the world, national, religious, political, economic, bureaucratic and
more.

Anyway, I do enjoy the back and forth of MG.

all the best,

</I>&gt;<i> Suggestions? If we have numerous suggestions, then we can formalize the

</I>&gt;<i> on our various democracy projects. Guest lecturers; topic debates,
</I>&gt;<i> addressing cross-project problems, collaborating on outreach, organizing a
</I>&gt;<i> cross-project funding mechanism... what do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. If it hasn't been evident, my participation has been rather low as
</I>&gt;<i> there have been several heavy demands on my time. I will do what I can to
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate these meetings, but would certainly appreciate any help anyone
</I>&gt;<i> would like to volunteer.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with Alex.  Cross-project discussion belongs here.  I know of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no other list that's both active and neutral.  Ed has biases (as we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all have) but he's meticulously careful not to force them on others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If a separate facility of cross-announcements were ever needed, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we might implement it manually to begin with.  An official &quot;announcer&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (could be anyone) would subscribe to all the necessary lists and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; post each announcement to all of them.  See how that works out.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I admin this list, but as we're all about collaboration, I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; to dictate the answer. What works for others?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; My suggestion of an Announce list was to hopefully avoid the scenario
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Nicolas brought up: over-cross-posting. If there is an announce list
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; does not allow discussion, it would only produce one message per week
</I>&gt;<i> (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; however often meetings are), and thus may be allowed to cross-post into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; other lists. Discussion of the topics and logistics of meetings could
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; covered on the existing metagov list for now, unless it becomes overly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; distracting from the topical discussions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. Although I am proposing a cross-posting list, I can see how it
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; not be welcome on dev lists. Dev lists should be limited to
</I>&gt;<i> development,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; and are usually complimented by another more general discussion list,
</I>&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; these announcements may be more welcome. So, Nicolas, while we
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; cross-post to adhocracy-dev, would <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">info at liqd.net</A> be an appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; alternative?
