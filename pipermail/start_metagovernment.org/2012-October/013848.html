<PRE>Marc and George,

Thanks Marc, I have a rough understanding of the model now.  If any
other English speakers have questions about it, then I'll try to
answer them.  Sometimes explaining is the best way to learn.  ;^)

Marc said:
&gt;<i> That's true. But IMHO if a Group is composed of 2..* Participants,
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't mean a Participant can't be member of several
</I>&gt;<i> Groups. So maybe we need a * multiplicity at the Groups side?
</I>
Or maybe an open diamond symbol (aggregate).  I think filled diamond
(composite) implies a single group.


George said:
&gt;<i> So, a couple of simple domain models for argumentative discussions
</I>&gt;<i> and consensus already exist:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A consensus ontology, based on IBIS, problem marketplaces and
</I>&gt;<i> idea management:

</I>
Welcome George,

<A HREF="http://www.imc.com.gr/ontologies/eDialogos/consensus/img/class_diagram_v0.1.png">http://www.imc.com.gr/ontologies/eDialogos/consensus/img/class_diagram_v0.1.png</A>
I was looking at the core relations (eDialogos below).  I think I can
map them to the terminology we use (in Outcast) and also AG Meinungs-
findungstool (CBEM/AG):


                  has                has
  IdeaContest  &lt;-------  Idea  -----------&gt;  User          (eDialogos)

         Poll  &lt;-------  Position  -------&gt;  Person        (Outcast)

        Topic  &lt;-------  Opinion  --------&gt;  Participant   (CBEM/AG)


Maybe this can be our Rosetta stone for the rest of the world. :-)

Michael

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I have some questions about the model.  To keep them separate from my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;other questions, I opened this thread.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(a) Why is discussion itself not modeled?  It's crucial of course, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I don't see it anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This model is currently meant to be the base solely for the discussion 
</I>&gt;<i> system!
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore the discussion itself is a 'Process' or 'Workflow' not an 
</I>&gt;<i> 'Entity'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(b) Why is a vote included as an actual (real world) entity?  Myself,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I think of voting as a formality of the system, something new we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;introduce.  It does have *correlates* in the real world, but people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;don't actually go about casting votes in order to form their opinions,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;not yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok. Sorry. This is definitely a problem in translation. Please read 'RATING' 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of 'VOTE' here!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(In fact, most of the right side seems to be modeling a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;artificial system yet to be deployed, not the real world.  I probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;mistook your meaning for &quot;business entity&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, that's me too ;o) Business Entity is not a good term at all. What it 
</I>&gt;<i> wants to express is, that it is not a DATA ENTITY, that can be mapped 
</I>&gt;<i> directly to a database schema. Even if sometimes it would ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact we are modeling the entities of an artificial system here. But maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> we can use the term 'Domain Entity' as George Anadiotis suggested. That's 
</I>&gt;<i> more close to what I think the entities are all about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Looking at the left side, I see a few possible errors:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(c) An opinion is not really (in itself) a document.  A document can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;be involved in the formalization and expression of an opinion, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;opinion is not bound to that form.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes you are right. So it is not realy about real world entities but more 
</I>&gt;<i> about the domain entities that are reflected by the system. So sorry for 
</I>&gt;<i> misleading you!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In our working group we decided, that the Discussion System is only able to 
</I>&gt;<i> deal with textual input. No video or audio processing capabilities. That's 
</I>&gt;<i> why at the end everything boils down to some combination of characters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(d) Likewise, a point of view is not an opinion (at least not in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;English).  It is one's outlook from a personal situation.  It may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;influence opinion in peculiar ways, but is not an opinion in itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok. That's unfortunately also lost in translation I believe. Please read 
</I>&gt;<i> POSITION instead of POINT OF VIEW. The groups position is a consensus of all 
</I>&gt;<i> individual opinions of the group members.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(e) Group membership is not a closed composite relation, but rather an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;open aggregate.  One can be a member of many groups.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's true. But IMHO if a Group is composed of 2..* Participants, that 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't mean a Participant can't be member of several Groups. So maybe we 
</I>&gt;<i> need a * multiplicity at the Groups side?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Although I don't have a full understanding yet, I suspect it will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;difficult to find the right model to code by.  It may take a while.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Later (in the other thread), I'll try to suggest a way of buying time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and (possibly) evolving some of the models by discovery.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok. Thank you!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> Marc

&gt;<i> Dear Marc and Michael, all
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i hope i am not &quot;interrupting&quot; your discussion, but it seems to me there is
</I>&gt;<i> something here which i may be able to contribute - even though
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately i have not been active on the list, i still do some work on
</I>&gt;<i> the topic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, i am glad to see that the discussion is getting active and entering
</I>&gt;<i> what appears to me like a standardization / integration stage. Typically,
</I>&gt;<i> there are 2 ways to deal with interoperability - on the functionality and
</I>&gt;<i> on the data level. So in your example, that would translate to having T1
</I>&gt;<i> being able to call some API on T2 in order to perform functions on it on
</I>&gt;<i> behalf of a T1 user, and vice versa, and having T1 and T2 exchange some
</I>&gt;<i> data in order to process them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some common denominator can be agreed on on both levels, however i would
</I>&gt;<i> like to emphasize more on the data side of things here. It seems to me that
</I>&gt;<i> what you are doing is trying to come up with a schema to describe basic
</I>&gt;<i> domain entities, their properties and relations - in other words, come up
</I>&gt;<i> with a domain ontology. I do not want to lecture anyone here or to go on
</I>&gt;<i> extensively about this, but i would just like to point out to a body of
</I>&gt;<i> scientific work on the subject that you may be interested in - there's no
</I>&gt;<i> point in reinventing the wheel after all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, a couple of simple domain models for argumentative discussions and
</I>&gt;<i> consensus already exist:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A consensus ontology, based on IBIS, problem marketplaces and idea
</I>&gt;<i> management: <A HREF="http://www.imc.com.gr/ontologies/eDialogos/consensus/">http://www.imc.com.gr/ontologies/eDialogos/consensus/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. An argumentative discussion ontology, based on
</I>&gt;<i> IBIS&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-Based_Information_System">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-Based_Information_System</A>&gt;and
</I>&gt;<i> SIOC &lt;<A HREF="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-494/coinpaper8.pdf">http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-494/coinpaper8.pdf</A>&gt;: <A HREF="http://">http://</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ceur-ws.org/Vol-405/paper4.pdf
</I>&gt;<i> 3. A survey of existing work in the domain:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj138_2.pdf">http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj138_2.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The 1st and 2nd approach can be harmonized, and this is set as future work.
</I>&gt;<i> There is also a body of work on the aspect of consensus on the ontology
</I>&gt;<i> development process itself which could be interesting here. Hope this
</I>&gt;<i> helps, let me know if you are interested in more details.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> best regards
