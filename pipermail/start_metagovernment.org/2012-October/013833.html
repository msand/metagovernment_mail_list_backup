<PRE>Hi Stephen,

I watched the video, but was disappointed.  I'm afraid Shirky is not a
reliable source of information.  Linus Torvalds did not invent
distributed version control (DVC).  He and the Linux developers
weren't even pioneers in the technology except in the role of users.
They had a free licence to use BitKeeper, a commercial product with
roots in Sun Microsystems, for long enough they got hooked on it.
Only when they lost it did they look elsewhere.

By that time, open source DVC's including Arch, Darcs and Monotone
were already available.  (I was using Darcs when Torvalds was still
using BitKeeper.)  Later Git and Mercurial were developed in parallel,
and Git is no better than Mercurial.  Shirky's claim that Torvalds
refused to accept the &quot;feudal&quot; status quo (No I'm not going to!) and
bravely set out to right things is a gross misrepresentation.

Not to say distributed systems aren't important.  I agree they are.

Michael
