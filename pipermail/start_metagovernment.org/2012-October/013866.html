Jumping in here, as I'm a list admin of adhocracy-dev. I'm not in favor
of such cross-postings, as adhocracy-dev is dedicated to the development
of the Adhocracy tool, and not about general discussion on
e-participation tools. I will thus reject further cross-postings in this
list.

Nevertheless, there's certainly overlapping interest between
adhocracy-dev subscribers and the current evolving discussion group.

I'd therefore suggest that you'll simply create a new discussion list
and write an announcement mail *once* to the other lists / addresses and
let users decide if they want to join in. I would :)

Cheers,
Nicolas
