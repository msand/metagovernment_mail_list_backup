Please, I don't understand your answer.  Do you think that opinion
expression (as I have described it) will be an essential part (among
other essential parts) of the platform you are designing?

&gt;<i> I've got 2 things to say to your concerns, Michael:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Your concerns feel like a dejavu to me; when ThomasE joined our
</I>&gt;<i> monday-meetings in mumble for the first time, we had the same
</I>&gt;<i> discussion. He had the same concerns than you and end of the story
</I>&gt;<i> is, that he is still with us, which is pretty revealing ^^ ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It's a question of what plug-ins are integrated into the framework:
</I>&gt;<i> If amoung the plug-ins is at least one plug-in, that enables &quot;divorced
</I>&gt;<i> consensus practices&quot;, then yes, the discussion platform does so.
</I>&gt;<i> You know, particularly regarding discussion splitting we had a long
</I>&gt;<i> discussion in the past; not everyone was happy with that step.
</I>&gt;<i> And why ? Because they had something different in their mind and
</I>&gt;<i> felt the threat, that their idea gets out-sorted by focussing on or
</I>&gt;<i> integration of discussion splitting.
</I>&gt;<i> We solved this conflict - which in case we all would try to bring us
</I>&gt;<i> to work on just one single MFT certainly would not stay the only
</I>&gt;<i> conflict - by this seperation of basic structure and detail structure,
</I>&gt;<i> or let's say framework + plug-ins.
</I>&gt;<i> So, there is room for pretty much all thinkable discussion methods,
</I>&gt;<i> no matter if it incorporates splitting, full text, text devision based
</I>&gt;<i> discussing, argument mapping, grouping, single input, and so on...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess there would be less questions and misunderstandings, if
</I>&gt;<i> the english translation of our basic idea would be ready; plz be patient,
</I>&gt;<i> it's in the process of being made:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://meinungsfindungstool.piratenpad.de/Anforderungsanalyse-Grundidee-translation">https://meinungsfindungstool.piratenpad.de/Anforderungsanalyse-Grundidee-translation</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well actually I see that indeed it is ready, but not neatly condenced
</I>&gt;<i> to a full-and-only english text; just read from line 84.
</I>&gt;<i> The colored lines are the translation of the uncolored german lines after 
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Greeting,
</I>&gt;<i> / aka Oliver
