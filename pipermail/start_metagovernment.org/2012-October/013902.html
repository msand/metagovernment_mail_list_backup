IMHO cooperation is the only way to solve this!

How many different kinds of light bulb sockets are you aware of?
Are there hundreds, thousands or even millions of them? Or just a few? Why?
Standardization helps producers and users to achieve their common goal to 
enlighten the world (and there will be light ;o)

Question is: What's the common goal for developers and useres in the sense 
of the decision-making process?

&gt;&gt;<i> At the end there might be an evolution of all possible and thinkable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> methodologies of discussion towards the optimum of decision-making tools.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And yes, of course, some tools might die. But again this must not be seen 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a bad thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With the Common Discussion Framework Standard you can easily move your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion over to another tool - and no effort on those tools is lost!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or did I get something wrong?
</I>
&gt;<i> I think so. The problem is that to reach consensus you really need most 
</I>&gt;<i> users,
</I>&gt;<i> so once a tool would succeed without OVN, it would have a very unfair
</I>&gt;<i> advantage over the competition. Or a bit more radical, we lose the 
</I>&gt;<i> consensus
</I>&gt;<i> approach completely if tools don't mirror each other. Once the consensus 
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> split already, no e-dem solution can succeed anymore without becoming the
</I>&gt;<i> monopoly itself even for simple majority rule (because of segmentation).
</I>
Hmm, I am not able to comment that, because I definitely lack of experience 
in this area. I have never been with a tool that combat with others.

But in my naive view the consensus must be reached among the developers of 
this type of tools and the users just benefit from the freedom to choose the 
tool they want.

But to reach consensus about the goal we first need to agree on the problem 
we want to solve.

For me this all boils down to the main question of the 21th century: &quot;How 
could we improve democracy and enable more participation and transparency 
for a nearly unlimited amount of people?&quot;

Please correct me if I get something wrong.

Cheers
marc
