<PRE>Hi Marc,

Although I'm not a member of the Meinungsfindungstool working group, I
have a personal concern with what you're working on.  Specifically it
involves the problem of &quot;split consensus&quot; as Thomas von der Elbe has
called it, or &quot;split opinion formation&quot; in your own terms.

But first I have some questions.  Do you have time to answer?

Marc said, October 10:
&gt;<i> One possible answer our working groups comes out with is, that we need to 
</I>&gt;<i> define kind of standardization. Like the W3C standardizes the internet and 
</I>&gt;<i> Business Entity Model...
</I>
And in reply to Pietro, October 16:
&gt;<i> The idea is to have a common base (framework of workflows and
</I>&gt;<i> entities) for all tools to enable the interaction and extensibility
</I>&gt;<i> of the overal process of decision-making. Therefore we need a common
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of how workflows and entities interacts in the
</I>&gt;<i> process.
</I>
I try to picture what you describe (pardon my ASCII):

             ....
          ..........  M
        ..............   ....
       .......................
       ......................
        .............   ....
          ..........
             ...


            +-----+  +-----+
            |     |  |     |
            | T1  |  | T2  |
            |     |  |     |
            +-|-|-+  +-|-|-+
    +---------|-|------|-|---+
    |         | |      | |   |
    |                        |
    |    S                   |
    |                        |
    +------------------------+


     M  Opinion in formation
     T  Competing tools
     S  Common standards, practices,
        databases, and so forth


Here T1 and T2 are competing tools for the purpose of opinion forming.
A user may choose T1 or T2.  But regardless of the choice (say it is
T2), the user will remain part of the same overall opinion forming
process (M).  So he/she may continue to work with other users who make
different choices (T1).  This technical freedom of choice is made
possible by the common standards, practices and/or databases (S) that
are shared between the competing tools.  Is this picture correct?
