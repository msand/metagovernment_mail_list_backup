One possibility is to hold a discussion whenever there's a problem
that needs addressing.  The focus of the discussion would then be on
the problem, instead of a project (project talks could still happen,
of course, in some weeks).  Like the project talks (but unlike the
regular meetings), the problem talks would each have a single focus
(one problem).  So those who were interested could attend, and the
schedule could &quot;roam&quot; more easily to accomodate them, as Ed suggests.

&gt;<i> Greetings Marc et al,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apologies for not participating earlier in the strings of conversations stemming from these talks. They do in fact interest me greatly, but as someone who is employed in the United States, the choice of German 21:30 on Mondays lands during the U.S. business day, making it usually impossible for me to attend. (And should anyone in Asia wish to participate, it lands in the middle of their night.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Might you consider a roaming time and date, so as to accommodate a more global audience? I understand of course that the talks stem from the German Pirate Party, but if they are to be &quot;international&quot; talks, then they will have to be more flexible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be happy to participate or even present if you could find a time I could attend (in Metagovernment, we often meet on weekends for this reason).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ed Pastore

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please note, that there is no International E-Democracy Talk on upcoming Monday, 22nd October!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because this is currently the weekly session slot of our working group 'AG Meinungsfindungstool' to discuss internal topics.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nevertheless we definitely want to proceed with the International E-Democracy Talk sessions, therefore we need to find a slightly different approach.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We would like to keep on talking - any suggestions or opinions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; marc
