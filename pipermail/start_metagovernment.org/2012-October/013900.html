<PRE>Hi Marc,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't think of competition as a fight with only negative impact -
</I>&gt;<i> think of it more in a cooperate way. The tools can also influence each other
</I>&gt;<i> in a positive way, instead of just dominating.
</I>Just as a quick note: This doesn't happen usually in social network sites. The 
evolutionary argument can be applied on any conflict or problem, but the 
quality of the reflected development (called progress or &quot;competition&quot;) is 
skewed once a monopoly is in place. We have to look at the problem at hand to 
understand how tools interact and what the users want to do.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the end there might be an evolution of all possible and thinkable
</I>&gt;<i> methodologies of discussion towards the optimum of decision-making tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, of course, some tools might die. But again this must not be seen as
</I>&gt;<i> a bad thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the Common Discussion Framework Standard you can easily move your
</I>&gt;<i> discussion over to another tool - and no effort on those tools is lost!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or did I get something wrong?
</I>
I think so. The problem is that to reach consensus you really need most users, 
so once a tool would succeed without OVN, it would have a very unfair 
advantage over the competition. Or a bit more radical, we lose the consensus 
approach completely if tools don't mirror each other. Once the consensus is 
split already, no e-dem solution can succeed anymore without becoming the 
monopoly itself even for simple majority rule (because of segmentation).
