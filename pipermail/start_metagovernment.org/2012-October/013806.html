Thats an open issues.
Currently we are trying to create precise definitions for several terms.
One of them is &quot;Information&quot; and it seems as there is no consensus about
what it should mean.
So personally I think &quot;Knowledge System&quot; might be a better word, but there
is a complex of terms that are very hard to define.
For me, it's a chain of terms in the following order:
*Noise -&gt; Signals/Signs/Symbols/Data/Evidence -&gt; Information -&gt; knowledge
-&gt; wisdom*

*Some additional thoughts:*
1. Noise
2. Signals/Signs/Marks ... occur and can be measured/represented.
2b. The LINK between signals/signs/marks and data is the method of
measurement. If its broken, data becomes noise.
3. Data has no Meaning. Data are symbols. Data is believed to be an
expression about reality.
3b.Data interpreted by humans has meaning and is called Information.
Information can be represented by different data sets. Information is
THOUGHT
Information occurs when symbols refer to something that has meaning (which
is only inside a persons mind)
4. Knowledge is build through learning of information.
Knowledge is about building a consistent model from information.
Knowledge can produce information (thoughts) in one's mind.

(5. Wisdom is about doing. Wisdom means application of knowledge in a
consistent manner all the time ...but this quickly gets very vague. ...)


*So what's the currently called &quot;information system&quot; all about?*
- It's a news system about what goes on in discussion and decision system.
- It probably informs one about the status quo, that means all accepted
decisions.
- It might contain a glossary, maybe a copy of statistics or other
important sources that were used during discussion or that back up decisions
- It allows customization about what you are interested in, what do you
wanna know, and so on...

Thats my vague understanding of it.

Maybe you also have some thoughts about the relation of the mentioned
terms. Maybe a complete ontology of it?
