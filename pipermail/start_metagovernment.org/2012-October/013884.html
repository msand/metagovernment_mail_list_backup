<PRE>Hi Mike,

I appreciate your patience, and respect your wish
to use your time carefully.

 &gt; I was hoping to get a rough sense of what you're
 &gt; proposing without reading all the details.

The Introduction (that you have now already found
and read) gives the briefest, broadest overview.
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/a1ad51d14fa5214ca243a64490e590b6">http://www.wiser.org/article/a1ad51d14fa5214ca243a64490e590b6</A>

The &quot;Isonomea Proposals&quot; wikipage contains an outline that
states each particular existing proposal in six words or less, on one line.
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/8eb6b81a94491ee91d2b004aa2727966">http://www.wiser.org/article/8eb6b81a94491ee91d2b004aa2727966</A>

At the bottom of each proposal wikipage, there is a &quot;Next&quot; link.
Following that link on each page will take you through
all of the proposals, in the order that they appear
on the &quot;Isonomea Proposals&quot; page. The first proposal:
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/13d467ac3657ffa24d7e9bb9634af70e">http://www.wiser.org/article/13d467ac3657ffa24d7e9bb9634af70e</A>

 &gt; I see your proposal is based on a game.
 &gt; Starting from there, can you summarize
 &gt; the whole proposal in a sentence or two?

The objective of the &quot;game&quot; is to create,
test, demonstrate, popularize, legitimize, start up,
and grow a new kind of social system, from scratch.

The game starts with no existing social system,
as if we were colonizing a new planet.

First we make the new social system fully operational
in an online virtual world (the new planet),
and then we use the choices, systems, and arrangements
of the virtual world as the &quot;blueprint&quot; for creating
the same social system in the real world.

The three primary kinds of &quot;moves&quot; in the game are:
- forming partnerships,
- submitting proposals,
- undertaking projects.

The wiki already contains over 150 proposal &quot;moves&quot; in this game.

 &gt;&gt; P.S. I just finished watching an Obama-Romney debate about
 &gt;&gt; how they would lead the world. It just astonishes me that almost
 &gt;&gt; everyone still buys into this idea that one person can/should have that
 &gt;&gt; kind of power. Anything we all can do to work together to make a more
 &gt;&gt; sane world has to be progress!

 &gt; YES!!!(Presidents, Legislators, Supreme Court Justices,
 &gt; Central Bank Chairmen, Heads of Multi-National Corporations,
 &gt; the 0.0001% that own corporations and governments)
 &gt;
 &gt; But the question arises, how much change is enough?
 &gt; (If the wall that we want to climb is 10 meters high,
 &gt; a 2 meter ladder is merely an empty gesture -- not a solution.
 &gt; Any solution must take into account all the dimensions of the problem.)
 &gt;
 &gt; For any here who may be interested in taking a walk on the wild side of
 &gt; &quot;How much change is enough?&quot;, there is new material available to peruse
 &gt; and respond to over at: <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/group/Freetimea">http://www.wiser.org/group/Freetimea</A>
 &gt;
 &gt; The new material lays out proposals for a new social system
 &gt; (including a new public decision system),
 &gt; and proposals for how to create it.
 &gt;
 &gt; I hope to see you there! (and here!)
