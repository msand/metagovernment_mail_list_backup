<PRE>Yes, I admin this list, but as we're all about collaboration, I don't want to dictate the answer. What works for others?

My suggestion of an Announce list was to hopefully avoid the scenario Nicolas brought up: over-cross-posting. If there is an announce list that does not allow discussion, it would only produce one message per week (or however often meetings are), and thus may be allowed to cross-post into other lists. Discussion of the topics and logistics of meetings could be covered on the existing metagov list for now, unless it becomes overly distracting from the topical discussions.


P.S. Although I am proposing a cross-posting list, I can see how it would not be welcome on dev lists. Dev lists should be limited to development, and are usually complimented by another more general discussion list, where these announcements may be more welcome. So, Nicolas, while we shouldn't cross-post to adhocracy-dev, would <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">info at liqd.net</A> be an appropriate alternative?
