<PRE>Just a little note to say that we moved Vilfredo from Google Code to Git.

The reason si that Google Code was a bit too hierarchical, and made it
difficult to sync between different people without becoming
authoritative. On Git hub my plan is to have Vilfredo generate an
environment with several forks of it exchanging code.
The old version will remain in the archive, for historical reasons,
and can be found at:
<A HREF="https://code.google.com/p/vilfredo-goes-to-athens">https://code.google.com/p/vilfredo-goes-to-athens</A>

The new version is present at:
<A HREF="https://github.com/pietrosperoni/Vilfredo">https://github.com/pietrosperoni/Vilfredo</A>

The next problem we have on Vilfredo is that inside the Vilfredo
website there are actually two different projects: the original
Vilfredo, and Vilfredo bubbles. But while the original Vilfredo is
open source, Vilfredo bubbles is Public source. Which means that you
do have access to the code but not the permission to reuse it. The
access is simply to permit you to make sure that the project is doing
what we claim is doing. And no hidden magic is going on behind the
scene.

It was probably the biggest error we made to have two projects with
different copyright on the same place. Because it made the updates
really complex. So what I will do in the next days is to work into
creating a clean and open source independent version of Vilfredo.
Which should then communicate with another site hosting the bubble
system.

Also the other problem is that Vilfredo, as it is now, also depends on
a number of private files where the passwords are stored. Although it
is inevitable that those cannot be shared, I will try to make a
version of them with the empty space so someone who wants to install a
separate version of Vilfredo can do it.

Please fork Vilfredo, and make all this effort worthwhile.

Cheers,
Pietro
