<PRE>Hi Ned,

I was hoping to get a rough sense of what you're proposing without
reading all the details.

Earlier you said:
&gt;<i> The new material lays out proposals for a new social system
</I>&gt;<i> (including a new public decision system), and proposals for how to
</I>&gt;<i> create it.
</I>
I eventually found this page, which I read:
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/a1ad51d14fa5214ca243a64490e590b6">http://www.wiser.org/article/a1ad51d14fa5214ca243a64490e590b6</A>

I see your proposal is based on a game.  Starting from there, can you
summarize the whole proposal in a sentence or two?

Mike

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think of what I am proposing as anything like a wiki. But,
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps you and I have very different ideas of what a wiki is.  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> (Perhaps the confusion stems from my having suggested that we put
</I>&gt;<i> our proposals into wikipages, rather than into listserve emails or
</I>&gt;<i> forum comments or blogs+comments? Those are the tools that we have
</I>&gt;<i> readily available, and it seems to me that networked wikipages are
</I>&gt;<i> the best of these bad choices. Do you disagree? If so, why?)
