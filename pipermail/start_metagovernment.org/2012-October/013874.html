<PRE>sounds as they are focused on the US only?

But I think to come in touch is always a good thing.

@Ed: Maybe we can subscribe with our possible new metagovernment mailing 
list to all those we want to contact and join forces with?

Dear all,

This looks like another nascent group for the purpose of cross-project
standards and infrastructure.

Hi everyone,

It was great to spend time with many of you at the NCDD conference in
Seattle earlier this month. It was an exciting conference, with so many
good people and great ideas.  Thanks to everyone who helped to make it a
success!

Many at the conference expressed a desire for better online tools to engage
people to strengthen communities, facilitate dialogue, solve problems and
coordinate action. As conversations at the conference developed, a group of
us realized that there&#8217;s an opportunity to come together to present a
collaborative proposal for consideration by NCDD for the Catalyst Awards (
<A HREF="http://ncdd.org/catalyst-awards">http://ncdd.org/catalyst-awards</A>).  We&#8217;re writing today to let you know
about our collaboration and to invite you to join our group.  You can find
more information and sign up at <A HREF="http://forums.e-democracy.org/groups/oddi.">http://forums.e-democracy.org/groups/oddi.</A>

Our group is in the process of defining how we&#8217;ll work together and what we
hope to accomplish. Early signs point towards the development of an open
standards/open source foundation that online engagement tools could be
built upon, eventually allowing practitioners to select the tools and
features most appropriate to the needs and desired outcomes of the
community being engaged.

We&#8217;ll occasionally report our progress to the larger NCDD community. We&#8217;d
welcome your input and participation if our work is of interest.

Warm regards,
ODDI Working Group
(Online Dialogue and Deliberation Infrastructure)
