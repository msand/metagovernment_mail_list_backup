<PRE>Hi Metagov,

I'm helping develop an opensource and non-commercial election app for
Facebook called EveryVote. While I don't expect political candidates to be
interested in it (at least right away), I think that students who are
running for student government office would use it to share their platform
with their school's population. I believe that as young people pay more
attention to their student government, they will pay more attention to all
governments.

Every day that goes by I can't believe there isn't already an election app
on Facebook. I think a simple app that allowed people to run for office and
vote on each other via Facebook is something that could help the world
today as soon as it is built, so I'm trying to help finish it asap.

If you or anyone you know have programming skills, the platform is about 20
hours away from being operational. If you support the idea and would like
to see it finished, please message me and/or forward this info to any
programmer friends of yours who might like to help finish a principled and
opensource election app.

This FB app project is the first phase of a larger vision for a global,
open, federated network of democracy facilitation websites:
