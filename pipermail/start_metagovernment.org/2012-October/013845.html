Hmm, I'm not sure if we missed the point here. Voting in the sense of 'to 
make a decision' is not part of the Descussion System we are talking about. 
It's part of the Decision System.

&gt;<i><A HREF="http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/4/45/DSFS-BusinessEntityModel.jpg">http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/4/45/DSFS-BusinessEntityModel.jpg</A>
</I>&gt;<i>(I opened a separate thread to discuss model details)
</I>
It's more about Rating (as I tried to clarify on the other thread) and 
forming one's opinion.

&gt;<i>Suppose further that these two voting tools (T1 and T2) are designed
</I>&gt;<i>to reveal and express the shape of opinion (M) as it forms.  Whenever
</I>&gt;<i>a user wants to know the general pattern of consensus and dissensus,
</I>&gt;<i>or related details, he/she can pick up his favourite voting tool (say
</I>&gt;<i>T2) and read the information from it.
</I>
&gt;<i>How do you feel about this?  Are you comfortable with voting being
</I>&gt;<i>used for this purpose?  (Myself, I feel it's very important to reveal
</I>&gt;<i>the shape of opinion as it emerges.  And I think active, continuous
</I>&gt;<i>voting is generally the best approach for this.)
</I>
Yes. If we can agree on 'VOTING' to be read as 'RATING'.

&gt;<i>How do others in the group feel?  I wish I could ask my question in
</I>&gt;<i>German, because I'm interested in hearing the views of anyone who
</I>&gt;<i>wants to speak.
</I>
The working group has consensus about the trisection of the tool based 
process of decision-making into Information, Discussion and Decision System.

Therefore I think the working group member all agree on 'VOTING' to be 
located in the Decision System and 'RATING' to be located in the 'Discussion 
System'. This is because we want to distinguish between the more formal 
process of decision, that needs to be conform with legal law, and the 
process of discussion that is free of all juridical rules.


Even if it is very hard for me to find the right words in english, I 
appreciate our discussion!

Hope you are lenient toward me ;o)

Cheers
Marc
