Thank you, I'd like that. :-)  I've been hopeful ever since I listened
to the transcript of the first meeting, especially where Oliver
describes the group and it's raison d'&#234;tre.

&gt;<i> Here is a first draft of our idea of a Common Business Entity Model
</I>&gt;<i> (where 'Business' means it's not a 'Data' Entity Relationship Model
</I>&gt;<i> assignable to a database schema, it's just objects found in the real
</I>&gt;<i> world - the database schema might look totally different):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/4/45/DSFS-BusinessEntityModel.jpg">http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/4/45/DSFS-BusinessEntityModel.jpg</A>
</I>
I have some questions about the model.  To keep them separate from my
other questions, I opened this thread.

(a) Why is discussion itself not modeled?  It's crucial of course, but
I don't see it anywhere.

(b) Why is a vote included as an actual (real world) entity?  Myself,
I think of voting as a formality of the system, something new we
introduce.  It does have *correlates* in the real world, but people
don't actually go about casting votes in order to form their opinions,
not yet.  (In fact, most of the right side seems to be modeling a
artificial system yet to be deployed, not the real world.  I probably
mistook your meaning for &quot;business entity&quot;.)

Looking at the left side, I see a few possible errors:

(c) An opinion is not really (in itself) a document.  A document can
be involved in the formalization and expression of an opinion, but the
opinion is not bound to that form.

(d) Likewise, a point of view is not an opinion (at least not in
English).  It is one's outlook from a personal situation.  It may
influence opinion in peculiar ways, but is not an opinion in itself.

(e) Group membership is not a closed composite relation, but rather an
open aggregate.  One can be a member of many groups.

Although I don't have a full understanding yet, I suspect it will be
difficult to find the right model to code by.  It may take a while.
Later (in the other thread), I'll try to suggest a way of buying time
and (possibly) evolving some of the models by discovery.

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is always time, when people doing the right things together ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So you wrote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Although I'm not a member of the Meinungsfindungstool working group, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;have a personal concern with what you're working on.  Specifically it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;involves the problem of &quot;split consensus&quot; as Thomas von der Elbe has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;called it, or &quot;split opinion formation&quot; in your own terms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be honest you don't need to be a member of our working group - even not
</I>&gt;<i> of Pirate Party - when you want to cooperate with us. It's all about coming
</I>&gt;<i> together and working on the right things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;But first I have some questions.  Do you have time to answer?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, you are welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Marc said, October 10:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; One possible answer our working groups comes out with is, that we need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; define kind of standardization. Like the W3C standardizes the internet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Business Entity Model...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;And in reply to Pietro, October 16:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The idea is to have a common base (framework of workflows and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; entities) for all tools to enable the interaction and extensibility
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of the overal process of decision-making. Therefore we need a common
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; understanding of how workflows and entities interacts in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I try to picture what you describe (pardon my ASCII):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I can't cite your ascii ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Here T1 and T2 are competing tools for the purpose of opinion forming.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;A user may choose T1 or T2.  But regardless of the choice (say it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;T2), the user will remain part of the same overall opinion forming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;process (M).  So he/she may continue to work with other users who make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;different choices (T1).  This technical freedom of choice is made
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;possible by the common standards, practices and/or databases (S) that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;are shared between the competing tools.  Is this picture correct?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's what our working group tries to establish.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And even more, if the user starts with T1 and then recognizes that T2 fits 
</I>&gt;<i> better to his needs, than he can just switch over to T2, if T2 provides a 
</I>&gt;<i> migration path to the Common Business Entity Model (CBEM) ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a first draft of our idea of a Common Business Entity Model (where 
</I>&gt;<i> 'Business' means it's not a 'Data' Entity Relationship Model assignable to a 
</I>&gt;<i> database schema, it's just objects found in the real world - the database 
</I>&gt;<i> schema might look totally different):

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately it's not fully translated yet, but I hope you understand our 
</I>&gt;<i> intention. The blue rectangles are objects that are part of the base 
</I>&gt;<i> framework standard. The red ones are specific to plug-ins, using the blue 
</I>&gt;<i> ones to inherit from, or just defining new ones.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the end the blue ones are those who all tools should be able to convert 
</I>&gt;<i> their own Model into. That's the way the different tools can interchange 
</I>&gt;<i> their data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this make sense?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
