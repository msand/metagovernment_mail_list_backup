<PRE>Hi Mike,

Could we create such new mailinglist for discussion on this topics on 
metagovernment.org or should we use the 'normal' <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start at metagovernment.org</A> 
list for our discussion to avoid cross postings in the future?

Cheers
marc

Hi all,

Jumping in here, as I'm a list admin of adhocracy-dev. I'm not in favor
of such cross-postings, as adhocracy-dev is dedicated to the development
of the Adhocracy tool, and not about general discussion on
e-participation tools. I will thus reject further cross-postings in this
list.

Nevertheless, there's certainly overlapping interest between
adhocracy-dev subscribers and the current evolving discussion group.

I'd therefore suggest that you'll simply create a new discussion list
and write an announcement mail *once* to the other lists / addresses and
let users decide if they want to join in. I would :)

Cheers,
Nicolas
