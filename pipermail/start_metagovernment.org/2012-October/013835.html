<PRE>Sorry to jump into my suit, Stephen.  But it burns me when people fail
to give credit where it's due.  And it especially burns me when (like
Shirky here) they instead use it to flatter the powerful, the rich,
and the famous who already have enough in the way of false honours and
unfair distributions, without adding more to the winner-take-all heap!

Just burns me... so that's why I wrote,

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> It's good to hear from you&#8230;..it's been a while. I'm sorry the talk was so disappointing but thanks for taking the time to reply.
</I>&gt;<i> I was just glad to see somebody talking about how the internet may someday transform government. It seemed similar enough to what you and the others are doing but, not be a developer myself, I'm completely unfamiliar with the technology, people and events you (or Shirky) mention.
</I>&gt;<i> I respect your perspective though and am just sorry it was such a let down for you.
</I>&gt;<i> I still follow along as best I can what you and the others are doing. It seems like things are progressing well.
</I>&gt;<i> I wish you the best. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
</I>&gt;<i> Take care,
</I>&gt;<i> Steve

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Stephen,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I watched the video, but was disappointed.  I'm afraid Shirky is not a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reliable source of information.  Linus Torvalds did not invent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distributed version control (DVC).  He and the Linux developers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; weren't even pioneers in the technology except in the role of users.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They had a free licence to use BitKeeper, a commercial product with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; roots in Sun Microsystems, for long enough they got hooked on it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Only when they lost it did they look elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By that time, open source DVC's including Arch, Darcs and Monotone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; were already available.  (I was using Darcs when Torvalds was still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using BitKeeper.)  Later Git and Mercurial were developed in parallel,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and Git is no better than Mercurial.  Shirky's claim that Torvalds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; refused to accept the &quot;feudal&quot; status quo (No I'm not going to!) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bravely set out to right things is a gross misrepresentation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not to say distributed systems aren't important.  I agree they are.
