     P.S. I just finished watching an Obama-Romney debate about
     how they would lead the world. It just astonishes me that almost
     everyone still buys into this idea that one person can/should have that
     kind of power. Anything we all can do to work together to make a more
     sane world has to be progress!

YES!!! (Presidents, Legislators, Supreme Court Justices, Heads of 
Multi-National
              Corporations, the 0.0001% that own corporations and 
governments)

But the question arises, how much change is enough?
(If the wall that we want to climb is 10 meters high,
a 2 meter ladder is merely an empty gesture -- not a solution.
Any solution must take into account all the dimensions of the problem.)

For any here who may be interested in taking a walk on the wild side of
&quot;How much change is enough?&quot;, there is new material available to peruse
and respond to over at: <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/group/Freetimea">http://www.wiser.org/group/Freetimea</A>

The new material lays out proposals for a new social system (including a
new public decision system), and proposals for how to create it.

I hope to see you there! (and here!)
