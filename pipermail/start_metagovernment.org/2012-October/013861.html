</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Rating will definitifely play a central role within most of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opinion forming tool plug-ins.  Every argument or key aspect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statement could need a rating...
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that such evaluations are also important.  But you see my
</I>&gt;<i> mistake I hope, and understand I'm speaking of something else.
</I>
I don't think you are speaking of something else, Mike. Rating each 
others positions/statements is part of what Votorola does. And it is 
part of the expression of my own opinion.

@ Slash:

&gt;<i> Basically it's worth it a try and everyone can and is supposed to do what
</I>&gt;<i> he wants. My personal view, however, is, that it would be more real
</I>&gt;<i> transparent, if the end results of such developments were stressed.
</I>&gt;<i> The way up to these end results often contains information, which
</I>&gt;<i> consist of mistaken assumptions and so are practically 'noise'.
</I>
Slash, you must be misunderstanding Mike. In his wording the 
developments which lead to the end results would be the discussion which 
leads to consensus. And I know, you don't see the discussion as noise.

@ Marc:
&gt;<i> Michael Allan wrote
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do you guys feel about opinion expression, as I describe it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Myself, again, I feel it's very important to reveal the shape of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opinion as it develops.  And I think active, continuous expression is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the best approach ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Opinion formation - as you described it - is a process over one's 
</I>&gt;<i> mind, right?
</I>&gt;<i> What about groups? Do they have a collective opinion formation process 
</I>&gt;<i> also?
</I>
Yes. Mike is describing that too. Votorola is a tool, where everybody 
can express his opinion and form groups with others and express their 
common opinion. In a way you could say: the whole use of expressing your 
opinion is to reach others, discuss with them and find a common opinion.

&gt;<i> IMHO the most relevant part is to compare different opinions with 
</I>&gt;<i> eachother. The discussion should evolve from a infinite amount of 
</I>&gt;<i> opinions into just some variations. Therfore group building processes 
</I>&gt;<i> might be fundamental to reach consensus.
</I>
Exactly!

&gt;<i> the basics needs to be reflected somehow in the domain model 
</I>&gt;<i> standardization. But the details are to be handled by the plug-ins or 
</I>&gt;<i> individual implementations. So I think that can be addressed by
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> participant has opinion
</I>&gt;<i> group consits of participants
</I>&gt;<i> group has position
</I>
I agree.

We are talking about the same and we have the same goal, believe it or 
not. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> Again, I'm interested in the views of anyone in the group.  What do
</I>&gt;<i> you think of this notion of opinion expression?  Is it good, bad or
</I>&gt;<i> just plain ugly?  ;^)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, that's what our working group tries to establish. ...  And even
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more, if the user starts with T1 and then recognizes that T2 fits
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> better to his needs, than he can just switch over to T2, if T2
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> provides a migration path to the Common Business Entity Model (CBEM)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ;o)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Okay, sounds good.  So let's assume that both T1 and T2 are compliant
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> plug-ins (i.e compliant with S).  This means the user can easily
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> switch back and forth.  This is the ideal, I agree.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now suppose T1 and T2 are voting tools.  There are different kinds of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tools, of course, each with its own competing instances.  But I want
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to look specifically at voting tools.  I see that voting is part of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the model under the category of &quot;assessment&quot;, if I understand.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm, I'm not sure if we missed the point here. Voting in the sense of 'to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make a decision' is not part of the Descussion System we are talking about.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's part of the Decision System.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (I opened a separate thread to discuss model details)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's more about Rating (as I tried to clarify on the other thread) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forming one's opinion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Suppose further that these two voting tools (T1 and T2) are designed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to reveal and express the shape of opinion (M) as it forms.  Whenever
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a user wants to know the general pattern of consensus and dissensus,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or related details, he/she can pick up his favourite voting tool (say
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> T2) and read the information from it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> How do you feel about this?  Are you comfortable with voting being
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> used for this purpose?  (Myself, I feel it's very important to reveal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the shape of opinion as it emerges.  And I think active, continuous
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> voting is generally the best approach for this.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes. If we can agree on 'VOTING' to be read as 'RATING'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> How do others in the group feel?  I wish I could ask my question in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> German, because I'm interested in hearing the views of anyone who
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wants to speak.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The working group has consensus about the trisection of the tool based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process of decision-making into Information, Discussion and Decision System.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore I think the working group member all agree on 'VOTING' to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> located in the Decision System and 'RATING' to be located in the 'Discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System'. This is because we want to distinguish between the more formal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process of decision, that needs to be conform with legal law, and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process of discussion that is free of all juridical rules.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if it is very hard for me to find the right words in english, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appreciate our discussion!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hope you are lenient toward me ;o)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> Slash said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have to make it short, because it's late:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2 Points:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. The use of the discussion system is not only to form oneself's opinion,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but also and especially to form the group's opinion and making this totally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Rating will definitifely play a central role within most of the opinion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forming tool plug-ins. Every argument or key aspect statement could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need a rating... The tricky thing is this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are different rating types.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There will be plug-in's only with thumb up and down for the whole
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> argument/key aspect statement/etc. ... and there will be plug-ins
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a more sophisticated approach where you rate an argument
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in three different aspects (importance, correctness,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easy-to-understanding, just for instance).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I fear, that plug-in's with 2 different rating types won't be able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to share their rating data, because they're producing totally different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> types of rating data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I think that this example gives a good insight in the difficulties of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this approach of the whole rudimentary discussion-system with it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plug-ins. The more rudimentary similarities a plug-in has with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rest of the discussion platform, the more it benefits from the platform.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So totally freaky unique plug-in approaches, making everything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamentally different than anyone else ever thought of before,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will have the least benefit of the plattform.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But on the other hand, of course, it's important to have diversity and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differences, because after all, this platform is about testing out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different approaches ;) ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's meant to be an ideal development environment for developers and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handy tool for the community at the same time. It is supposed to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useful for everyone right from the start and be the most efficient,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shortest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way to make progress developing higher, more optimal forms of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a discussion system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just one detail - world premier, never uttered before ! :D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the bottom of the discussion system site should be a feedback
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> area, which is nicely designed and collects feedback of the community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the different plug-ins with a smart system, so that the people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really think through their decissions... maybe by only making it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible for them to give 3 points as a whole for all listed suggestions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improvement regarding a plug-in, so that they can't and won't vote for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all suggestions, but only the currently most important for them...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well, and from there the feedback goes to the developers, so that they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always see, what improvement the community currently wants to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applied the most...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I like the thought of designing the discussion system so, that it is strong
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where LQFB is weak; and a lively feedbeck system, which is practically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considered by the developers, definetively would be one point to reach
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this.
