That's an excellent introduction.  I would put that at the top of the
intro page, and anywhere else folks might ask, &quot;What's this about?&quot;

A possible risk: What works in a blank-slate, pretend world does not
work in a real world with a history, material interests, and so forth.
So the translation from game to reality fails, or isn't quite as
straightforward as we hope.  (Not that this would necessarily be a
show stopper, as you might find a solution along the way.)

In any case, please don't forget to share your progress (stuff you
learn, and what not) in real-world forums such as this one.  :-)

</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;Isonomea Proposals&quot; wikipage contains an outline that

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The objective of the &quot;game&quot; is to create,
</I>&gt;<i> test, demonstrate, popularize, legitimize, start up,
</I>&gt;<i> and grow a new kind of social system, from scratch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The game starts with no existing social system,
</I>&gt;<i> as if we were colonizing a new planet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First we make the new social system fully operational
</I>&gt;<i> in an online virtual world (the new planet),
</I>&gt;<i> and then we use the choices, systems, and arrangements
</I>&gt;<i> of the virtual world as the &quot;blueprint&quot; for creating
</I>&gt;<i> the same social system in the real world.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The three primary kinds of &quot;moves&quot; in the game are:
</I>&gt;<i> - forming partnerships,
</I>&gt;<i> - submitting proposals,
</I>&gt;<i> - undertaking projects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The wiki already contains over 150 proposal &quot;moves&quot; in this game.
