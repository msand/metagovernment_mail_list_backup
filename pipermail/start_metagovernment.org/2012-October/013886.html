I agree with Alex.  Cross-project discussion belongs here.  I know of
no other list that's both active and neutral.  Ed has biases (as we
all have) but he's meticulously careful not to force them on others.

If a separate facility of cross-announcements were ever needed, then
we might implement it manually to begin with.  An official &quot;announcer&quot;
(could be anyone) would subscribe to all the necessary lists and then
post each announcement to all of them.  See how that works out.

My opinion,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I admin this list, but as we're all about collaboration, I don't want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to dictate the answer. What works for others?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My suggestion of an Announce list was to hopefully avoid the scenario
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nicolas brought up: over-cross-posting. If there is an announce list that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not allow discussion, it would only produce one message per week (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; however often meetings are), and thus may be allowed to cross-post into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other lists. Discussion of the topics and logistics of meetings could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; covered on the existing metagov list for now, unless it becomes overly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distracting from the topical discussions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; P.S. Although I am proposing a cross-posting list, I can see how it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not be welcome on dev lists. Dev lists should be limited to development,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and are usually complimented by another more general discussion list, where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these announcements may be more welcome. So, Nicolas, while we shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cross-post to adhocracy-dev, would <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">info at liqd.net</A> be an appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alternative?
