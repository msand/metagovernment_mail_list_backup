</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  ** &quot;Information media&quot; or &quot;information system&quot; is perhaps not a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     good name for this category.  All three corners of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     triangle are concerned with informational content.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe.  So could you make suggestions for a better name? :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Information&quot; seems too broad, and &quot;fact&quot; too narrow.  Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;knowledge system&quot;?
</I>
For me &quot;knowledge system&quot; triggers too many other buzzwords like knowledge base, expert system and artificial intelligence which are probably all wrong, at least in this context, and perhaps in others, too. 

&gt;<i> Thats an open issues.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently we are trying to create precise definitions for several terms. One of them is &quot;Information&quot; and it seems as there is no consensus about what it should mean.
</I>&gt;<i> So personally I think &quot;Knowledge System&quot; might be a better word, but there is a complex of terms that are very hard to define.
</I>&gt;<i> For me, it's a chain of terms in the following order:
</I>&gt;<i> Noise -&gt; Signals/Signs/Symbols/Data/Evidence -&gt; Information -&gt; knowledge -&gt; wisdom
</I>
I'm not sure we have to dig this deep, do we? If so, I wonder what the metric behind this list is? ;-) I guess it must be related to human consciousness, somehow.
 
&gt;<i> Some additional thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Noise
</I>
I think noise deserves no special position here, being essentially nothing else but &quot;useless&quot; or &quot;background&quot; data, non-data so to say. Ok, it could also be data we are just not yet able to interpret, and then it's also just that, data.

&gt;<i> 2. Signals/Signs/Marks ... occur and can be measured/represented.
</I>&gt;<i> 2b. The LINK between signals/signs/marks and data is the method of measurement. If its broken, data becomes noise.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Data has no Meaning. Data are symbols. Data is believed to be an expression about reality.
</I>&gt;<i> 3b.Data interpreted by humans has meaning and is called Information.
</I>&gt;<i> Information can be represented by different data sets. Information is THOUGHT
</I>&gt;<i> Information occurs when symbols refer to something that has meaning (which is only inside a persons mind)
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Knowledge is build through learning of information.
</I>&gt;<i> Knowledge is about building a consistent model from information.
</I>&gt;<i> Knowledge can produce information (thoughts) in one's mind.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (5. Wisdom is about doing. Wisdom means application of knowledge in a consistent manner all the time ...but this quickly gets very vague. ...)
</I>
I think this raises too many philosophical issues for which this might not be the best place to discuss. 

&gt;<i> So what's the currently called &quot;information system&quot; all about?
</I>&gt;<i> - It's a news system about what goes on in discussion and decision system.
</I>&gt;<i> - It probably informs one about the status quo, that means all accepted decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> - It might contain a glossary, maybe a copy of statistics or other important sources that were used during discussion or that back up decisions
</I>&gt;<i> - It allows customization about what you are interested in, what do you wanna know, and so on...
</I>
Just add one word and the purpose of this information system might be more instantly clear to many: it tries to collect, store and maybe help structure *objective* data (or information for that sake) about the real world. I'm sure Alex will provide a good definition of what &quot;objective&quot; means... ;-)

The problem I see with that is that as soon as humans enter the game it becomes quickly very difficult to determine objective data about their behaviour and relationships.

Cheers,

Dinu
