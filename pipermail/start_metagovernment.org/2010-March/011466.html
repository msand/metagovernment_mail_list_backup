<PRE>&quot;Does Metagov have a list of 'objectives'?&quot;  That's a very good question,
Phil.

 

I can't say for sure.  The best I can tell you is that I compiled a couple
drafts in StratML format at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#Metagov">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#Metagov</A>  However, since the goal
statements they contain have not been transformed into measurable objectives
nor have stakeholders of the performer or beneficiary type been associated
with them, it is unclear whether they are truly objectives or merely
thoughts (wishes) that occurred to somebody at some time.

 

I'm copying the Metagov listserv for any comments its subscribers may wish
to offer.

Thanks Owen cc Ed and Jonathan

 

Owen: your second sentence says it all - few people get beyond &quot;talking
about&quot; collaboration and actually &quot;doing it&quot;.

 

Therefore, we've been trying to understand what we need to do to get people
willing and motivated to actually collaborate.

 

Having a VERY simple, commonly understood language (PRUB) is a key step in
the right direction.  It's not sufficient on it's own (hence our full
OpenStrategy system), but it's essential (which is part of the motivation
for StratML).

 

I'm confident that PRUB-strategic-thinking could help clarify Metagov's
&quot;objectives&quot;, if only by clarifying what is meant by an &quot;objective&quot;.  In our
experience, the word &quot;objective&quot; can mean one of many different things on
the continuum between &quot;a good idea to do something&quot; right through to &quot;a
Benefit for end users&quot;.  

 

This is precisely why we use the very exact words of Projects, Results, Uses
and Benefits when we &quot;translate&quot; people's Objectives into these categories.
Over and over again (perhaps 90% of the time), we find that people's
&quot;objectives&quot; are what we would categorise as &quot;Results&quot; (or even &quot;Projects&quot;)
which are relatively early on the idea-Benefit continuum.  

 

In order to gain clarity and exactness on the idea-Benefit continuum, we
therefore encourage people to avoid the use of words like &quot;objectives&quot; and
&quot;goals&quot;, and instead use the more precise PRUB terminology.  In doing so, it
then becomes straightforward to complete the full PRUB sequence.  

 

In particular, it's essential to understand &quot;Uses&quot;  (and in so doing, to
become &quot;user/citizen focused&quot;).

 

ONLY Uses create Benefits/outcomes.

 

Projects don't create Benefits/outcomes.

 

Results don't create Benefits/outcomes.

 

So irrespective of how beautiful a Result might be, if it isn't Used then
there won't be any Benefits.

 

Therefore if people are going to define their &quot;objectives&quot; as what we would
call Projects, then unless they unequivocally link them through Results and
Uses to Benefits, they are probably wasting their time.

 

Does MetaGov have a list of &quot;objectives&quot;?   If so, and if it's not too long,
then I'd be happy to review the list and categorise them as Projects,
Results, Uses or Benefits.  Based on our experience, organisations usually
find such a categorisation to be enlightening and helpful.

 

To give you an indication of the stark reality of what we find when we
translate organisation's strategies/objectives into the OpenStrategy/PRUB
format:

1.	more than 50% and usually more than 80% of published &quot;strategies&quot;
and &quot;Objectives&quot; are in fact Projects or Results 
2.	less than 10% (usually less than 1%) of Uses are defined in any way
3.	of those few Uses that have been defined, we've practically never
found any evidence that the proposed Results will genuinely be Used
4.	we've similarly found almost no evidence that the defined Uses will
actually generate any Benefits
5.	almost no Users have been involved in the preparation of the
strategy/objectives documents
6.	fewer than 10% of objectives are linked in any way to Benefits
(&quot;outcomes&quot; in government jargon)
7.	so it's hardly surprising that (in our observation) at least 90% of
strategies make absolutely no difference

 

So my offer is there if MetaGov wish to take it up.

 

Kind regards

 

Phil

Very insightful comments, Phil . meaning that they are highly consistent
with my own experience, including my experience with the OpenKollab and
Metagov folks (not to mention the Systems Dynamics folks, from whose
listserv I unsubscribed in frustration).  <A HREF="http://www.systemdynamics.org/">http://www.systemdynamics.org/</A>   

 

People seem to be much more interested in talking about collaborating than
actually doing it to accomplish explicitly documented objectives whose
results (outputs) and benefits (outcomes) can be measured and reported.

 

We have no illusions of changing that fact directly.  However, we do hope
that Part 2 of the StratML standard, addressing the elements of performance
plans and reports, will help to make reality more salient to stakeholders -
in which case *they* will take steps to change it . if they care to do so.

 

I'm copying Ed in the event there may be any prospects for using your
application to help the Metagov folks focus on sub-strategies (objectives)
having a reasonable chance of producing measurable results (outputs), if not
benefits (outcomes).

Dear OpenKollab members

 

I've just joined OpenKollab and am not sure of the protocols for posting so
I hope I'm doing the right thing here.

 

OpenKollab totally resonates with us as we've been doing open collaboration
for about 10 years and have built up a detailed, fully functioning
multi-stakeholder strategy development system - OpenStrategy (there is some
basic information on www.openstrategies.com - we'll update this site by May)

 

This email is not a commercial for OpenStrategy.

 

I'm just sharing some of the enormous amount we've learned about what does
and doesn't work with real people in collaborative multi-stakeholder groups
(we have much more learning than what I've summarised below).

 

If nothing else, we've learned that what's technologically possible is
almost irrelevant - it's what real-world people are actually prepared to do
that is the overwhelming constraining factor in large-scale collaboration.
Indeed our OpenStrategy system is perhaps 90% philosophy, psychology and
sociology and 10% technology (primarily our web-tool).

 

Our &quot;collaboration space&quot; relates to large-scale, multi-stakeholder groups,
typically in the public sector in the UK (we have an Oxford office) and NZ
(head office Christchurch).  

 

For example, we typically work with groups of say 100 organisations who are
trying to collaboratively create and implement large scale strategies (eg a
county-wide Children and Young Person's strategy, a City Sustainable
Community strategy, a multi-city Health Improvement strategy or a regional
Climate Change strategy).  We find that:

1.	most stakeholders say they want to collaborate (it's such a lovely
warm concept, mmmmm), perhaps 95% will attend collaborative workshops and
talk about collaboration, and perhaps 5% will actually collaborate in small
groups of 2-3 organisations (collaborative doing is utterly different from
collaborative chatting or collaborative data collecting/archiving/sharing)
(and maybe 50% will give advice on how others should collaborate.... there
is no shortage of advice, just a shortage of effective working collaboration
systems) 
2.	most organisational stakeholders want to continue to work inside
their own organisational silos (they usually have to, for financial
accountability reasons), so the challenge is to &quot;join up the silos&quot; not
&quot;break down the silos&quot; 
3.	there must be a common language when people wish to collaborate.  
4.	In collaborative strategy-space with hundreds of stakeholders, we
can't work collaboratively with a plethora of words such as objectives,
goals, outputs, outcomes, targets, visions, mission, drivers for change,
structures, frameworks, thought-pieces,.... specially when they all mean
different things to different people (see also StratML - Strategic Markup
Language being developed by AIIM and driven by Owen Ambur) 
5.	cognitively, average humans can readily handle 4 +/- 2 pieces of
information, so for real-world people there is not much point developing
sophisticated collaboration systems based on more complex data sets - they
may be meaningful to the tiny percentage of people who are large-scale
integrators (often INTJs), but most people in a normal community think and
work on a much smaller scale.   
6.	If we want stakeholders to engage and to actually collaborate (as
distinct from talk about it), we have to develop collaboration systems that
they can get their heads around (if you've read this far, can I plead with
you to seriously consider this issue so that your collective brainpower can
be brought to bear on creating simple, pragmatic/practical collaboration
systems that can genuinely enable large-scale, real-world communities to
plan/strategise/implement effectively to make this world a better place) 
7.	so for effective large-scale strategy/planning collaboration (as
distinct from social discussion networks) we need to identify an explicitly
defined sub-set of information which meets the following criteria: 

1.	it is the smallest set of information 
2.	which has the highest value 
3.	to the most people 

8.	we are now confident that this subset is (we think, universally)
what we call PRUB: 

1.	Organisations run Projects     (organisational action) 
2.	that produce Results            (organisational consequence) 
3.	that communities Use        (community action) 
4.	to create Benefits for themselves        (community consequence) 

9.	all other information is of lower value to the collective of
stakeholders, although individual bits of information will have higher value
to individuals 
10.	an interlinked set of PRUBs is what we call a SubStrategy 
11.	a collection of SubStrategies is what we call an OpenStrategy 
12.	to create a strategy, start with Benefits and work back to Projects
(BURP) 
13.	to implement a strategy, start with Projects and work through to
Benefits (PRUB) 
14.	so PRUB/SubStrategies/OpenStrategies are simultaneously strategies
(BURP) and implementation plans (PRUB) 
15.	they enable stakeholders to explicitly define exactly what they are
doing (as SubStrategies) and readily share them with other stakeholders via
our on-line OpenStrategy web-tool 
16.	other stakeholders can search the OpenStrategy to find SubStrategies
of interest to them, contact the Project leaders and start collaborating
(along the same lines of open source software projects - a programmer kicks
off with a good idea and others collaborate by clustering around them) 
17.	so practical collaboration is a &quot;voluntary engaging of the willing
with the willing&quot;, and it usually happens on a rather small scale 
18.	it's worth considering the mathematics of multi-stakeholder
collaboration on multiple topics based on the idea of 'networking' of
stakeholders:  if 100 organisations wish to collaborate on 50 topics by
talking to each other just 6 times per year on each topic, this amounts to
about 1,500,000 conversations.... - is that really going to happen
effectively - and make any difference in the world?  What happens to the
content of the communications?  
19.	We put forward the following concept: 

1.	Type 1 collaborative strategy = hierarchy of people - someone at
&quot;the top&quot; creates/coordinates it: doesn't work unless top dogs have huge
power (in which case they get their way, which seldom means that communities
get the Benefits they want) 
2.	Type 2 collaborative strategy = networks of people:  mathematically
impossible to network everyone effectively on all topics (as shown above) 
3.	Type 3 collaborative strategy = networks of ideas (eg
SubStrategies/OpenStrategies) so that stakeholders share what they are doing
in an on-line OpenStrategy and other stakeholders cluster around them:
mathematically very doable - even a complex community will have at most a
few thousand SubStrategies and usually only a few hundred (this is
important.  Some people want to add more information than just PRUB - but
think about it - if a multi-stakeholder group has 500 Projects (and hence
4-500 SubStrategies), that's about 2000 PRUBs.  In our system, we also have
&quot;Links&quot; between each P, R, U, B and &quot;Evidence&quot; for each Link - so we're
already up to 4-5,000 pieces of information, albeit nicely &quot;chunked up&quot; into
meaningful SubStrategies.  We find that any more information than that
simply overwhelms multi-stakeholder groups - so as noted earlier, we need
&quot;the smallest amount of information that has the highest value to the most
people&quot; - we're convinced this information SubSet is PRUB which can build
into a library of SubStrategies = an OpenStrategy 

Our experience shows universally that stakeholders, at all levels, really
&quot;get it&quot; with SubStrategies - they can get their heads around the simplicity
of PRUB and the slightly more complex concept of SubStrategies (each
SubStrategy may contain several inter-linked PRUBs).  Warning: there are
many subtleties in PRUB (eg Orphan Results, end-point Results, unwanted
Results, evolving Results, non-discretionary Results etc.....) but the core
concept of PRUB is utterly robust and effective.

 

I hope that's a helpful set of observations and comments for openkollab
members - there is more where that came from!

 

We're totally open to critical feedback as our goal is to keep refining
OpenStrategy thinking and improving large scale collaborations to make the
world a better place, so I welcome your feedback.  

 

Because we're a tiny NZ company struggling to survive, I work long hours
holding things together.  I therefore may not have time to respond to
everyone's responses to my comments above although I'll do my best (in an
hour I'm heading to our West Coast for a Wild Foods Festival so won't be
responding for the next 72 hours).

 

However, if anyone is interested in more detail, send me an email
(<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">phil at openstrategies.com</A>) and I'll forward to you a PDF copy of our
OpenStrategy book (it's a few years old now).  If the principles of
OpenStrategy resonate with you I'll then send you a copy of our forthcoming
up-date booklet (hopefully available by April).

 

In the meantime, if anyone wants to invest in our NZ company to help keep us
afloat, please don't hesitate to email me (we're currently seeking about
$US250,000 to fund company growth, primarily in the UK).

 

With best wishes to all OpenKollab initiatives.
