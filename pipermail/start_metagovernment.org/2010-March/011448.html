<PRE>The next meeting of this project is scheduled for 1700 GMT tomorrow.  
However, only four people have RSVPd and one of those is tentative. If  
there are fewer than five, we may postpone the meeting.

The topic is: goals &amp; objectives for the Metagovernment project. I  
would hope that more than four of us are interested in that.

If you can attend, please add your name to the Participants list:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/6">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/6</A>

If you would like to attend but cannot, please reply here to let us  
know. If that's the case with several people, then we certainly should  
postpone it until you can attend.

If you don't want to attend this meeting, please reply saying why. It  
would be really helpful for us to know what is wrong with the idea of  
the meeting.

Thanks.
