The new proposal was mine, but after the question moved on to the next  
generation I realized that one of the existing proposals appealed to  
me more. When it was in the stage where additional proposals could be  
written, all I saw of one of the longer ones was the abstract, not the  
entire proposal. (I think... I am trying to recreate my experience  
here... now I do not see an abstract for it at all, though it is  
longer than 1000 characters.) I do not know if I could have expanded  
the body, but I'm just letting you know that the interface as it is  
now failed me in that I did not see/notice the longer body of the  
proposal. Had I done so, I would not have made the new proposal that I  
did, since I favor the existing proposal more than more (and have  
voted accordingly).
