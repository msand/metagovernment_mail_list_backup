My home page links to the mailing list.  That's where I participate in
Metagov.  (I'm grateful for that, because good e-dem mailing lists are
few and far between.)

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Metagovernment:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - actively promotes all projects (and the general principles of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; collaborative governance) on the web, at conferences, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - seeks out opportunities to promote specific projects where  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - encourages each of its individual members to commit some time to at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; least one active project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - coordinates the Standardization project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - seeks out additional forms of cooperation between some or all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; projects; actively promotes synergy when possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - works toward hosting a conference to promote collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; governance and the active projects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That might be too ambitious.  You might not have the resources for all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that.  Maybe just pick one task, and try to move it forward.  Aim for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; results (as Owen suggests) and see what happens.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, taking the above in order...
</I>
But I suggested taking one of them, not all. :^)

&gt;<i> The fourth, the Standardization project, I think is our most tangible  
</I>&gt;<i> and beneficial potential near-time objective. And Michael, you have  
</I>&gt;<i> been the lead on that. I would like to encourage others to contribute  
</I>&gt;<i> to it, but I think many (including myself) have had a hard time  
</I>&gt;<i> wrapping our heads around it. Is it something others could contribute  
</I>&gt;<i> to, and if so, could you help us understand how?
</I>
Probably I can't.*  If your question (when pressed) is &quot;How can I
contribute?&quot;, then your skills and interests don't apply.

Or maybe there's a misunderstanding.  We're not trying to agree on
standards.  As Owen suggests, we're just doing it.  We're building a
working impl of e-dem, and it necessarily cuts across all projects.**

  * But I'm only a designer and implementor.  Mark Murphy was more a
    leader on the concept side, and Thomas on the cross-project effort
    (not to mention a major contrib to the arch design).

 ** E-dem cannot work without common poll/issue definitions, a common
    residential register, cross-project vote mirroring and open
    interfaces among voting, drafting and discussion media.  These are
    things we're doing.
