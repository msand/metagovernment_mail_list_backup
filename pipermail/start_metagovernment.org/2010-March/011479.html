<PRE>Thanks for the suggestions, Mat&#237;as.

 

With respect to your first suggestion, any number of folks are working to
promote the Semantic Web, and while I don&#146;t have any particular expertise in
that regard, I am always on the lookout for opportunities to contribute as
well as to leverage the work of others.  AIIM&#146;s StratML Committee does not
plan at this point to try to include in the StratML vocabulary and schema
the necessary elements to describe &#147;projects&#148; and &#147;programs.&#148;  However, we
recognize that the linkages between goals/objectives and projects and
programs should be drawn at some point.  Right now we are focusing in
StratML Part &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part2">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part2</A>&gt;  2 on the elements of
performance plans and reports.  Depending upon the level of interest among
committee members (anyone can participate), we could consider incorporating
in Part &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3</A>&gt;  3 the elements required to
describe projects and programs.

 

Regarding your second suggestion, yes, by all means, we do hope and
anticipate that intermediaries will build specialized StratML-enabled search
indices for various communities of interest.  It is a bit of a
chicken-or-egg situation since there is no incentive to build such indices
until a fairly large number of StratML documents have been posted but folks
may not want to spend a lot of time rendering their plans in StratML format
until services are available to leverage the intelligence they contain.
However, Mark Logic has developed a StratML search service prototype and Joe
Carmel has provided the capability to catalog StratML files using his XForms
form &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Forms">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Forms</A>&gt; .  For development and testing
purposes, there are now more than 550 plans in the (prototypical) StratML
collection &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm</A>&gt;  but, of course, the
aim is for the agencies and organizations to maintain their own plans in
StratML format on their own Web sites.

 

Yes, the initial focus has been on the plans that U.S. federal agencies are
required to compile and maintain under the Government Performance and
Results Act  (GPRA).  However, with the aim of establishing StratML as an
international voluntary consensus standard, we are endeavoring to specify
the vocabulary and schema generically enough to apply to the plans of all
organizations worldwide, as well as individuals who choose to lead
mission/goal-directed lives.

 

BTW, I agree that an MOU could be useful in advancing the cause of Metagov.
If one is drafted, I may wish to render it as a performance plan as a test
of the vocabulary and schema for StratML Part 2.

Yes Pietro, I also agree on the limited scope of StratML: it could be very
useful between US government agencies, and I think that to serve these
organizations StratML was conceived in first place for.

I've being doing my web programming homework and I've better understanding
of the difference between XML and HTML (also Owen pointed that out to me),
the problem with keywords and spam... Now, I'd suggest to Owen's project
some decentralization in the following way:

* To encourage agencies to add useful, project-oriented semantic information
through StartML to their websites; deprecating manual indexing. As I imagine
that agencies are serious, they won't be messing with what they write, not
creating spam.

* To build a simple search engine that only crawls the .gov top level
domain, looking for text enclosed in StratML elements. Here complicated
algorithms aren't needed for measuring the quality of a site (that contains
StratML), since all of them are valuable.
