<PRE>Thanks for the feedback, Ed.

I noticed that I have been the only person using the abstract.

We need to change this somehow. Instead of just showing the abstract maybe
we should show the first 500 characters of the proposal too. And then we add
a &lt;read more&gt; tag.

Also right now people who write the abstract only can have 500 characters
appear while the others can have up 1000, which is somehow unfair.

Please do keep on sending us feedback, we need them to make the tool usable,

I can't move-on the question right now, but maybe as soon as I can move it
on, we will go back to the proposal phase, and both you and Thomas write the
new proposals.

I wonder how we (programmers) could have made sure this confusion did not
happen. :-/

Pietro
