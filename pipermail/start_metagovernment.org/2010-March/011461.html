<PRE>Ed, there is a bit of confusion.

We decided to have a meeting 3 weeks ago and I signed for that. We were not
enough, and the meeting moved on.
I would suggest that when this happens we delete all the people from the
list of the person that will come, and we start again from zero. My name was
moved on the new page automatically, because the new page was... the old
page.

And I was not the only one.

Which explain why people who were expected did not come.

I think the actual format is very good. Just let's be more precise. If we
don't have enough people the meeting does not start. If the meeting does not
start we do it two weeks later. But then we start again taking signatures
from zero.


Regards,
Pietro
