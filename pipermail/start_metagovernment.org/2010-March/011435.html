</I>
My reason for low interest in MG is approximately the same as for my
apathy toward all other governments I already pay for: I do not have
any *real* control.

My explanation for this lack of control has to do with how traditional
taxation and donations do not let the individual 'target' those
investments toward what he thinks are important, but are instead put
into a sort of &quot;slush fund&quot; that a well-intentioned committee or other
'representative' then uses as THEY see fit.

For example, let's say a City-Council decides they should build a new
&quot;Recreation Center&quot; for citizens to use in various ways.

With traditional taxation, I am *required* to help pay for that
construction unless I can get a majority of others to complain that it
is not needed because I already paid taxes into an untargeted &quot;slush
fund&quot;.

I cannot opt-out unless I group with others to opt-out.  If I 'win' by
stopping construction, it causes others to 'lose' because they DID
want to fund the project.

An 'opt-in' approach would allow individuals to fund only the
initiatives they appreciate, while leaving others to do as they please
as well.

Under such an arrangement, if 99% of the citizens want some certain
project, and 1% do not, then the 99% choose to pay for it, and the 1%
can simply ignore it.  Nobody loses and nobody is forced to pay for
something they do not want.


This all seems a bit disconnected from MG since I've never given any
donation here (though I guess work such as this email, if considered
valuable, might be a form of donation?)...

But I *would* be willing to send money and add value in other ways IF
I have the control to *target* that value, and also to gain real
ownership in the Physical Sources (Material Assets) used to host the
MG activity.


So, toward answering the other parts of this email about pooling
resources I present a challenge:

Could we host an instance of <A HREF="http://EtherPad.GoogleCode.com">http://EtherPad.GoogleCode.com</A> server,
and if so, how and who would pay those extra costs?


Thanks,
Patrick Anderson
