It's still running.  Here's the latest votes imported from Whitehouse2
etc: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/system/host/u/var/cache/votorola/v/in/vomir/">http://u.zelea.com/system/host/u/var/cache/votorola/v/in/vomir/</A>

&gt;<i> ... And only Votorola and Adhocracy are doing Vote-export...
</I>
Here's our own exports:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/system/host/u/var/cache/votorola/v/out/vocount/">http://u.zelea.com/system/host/u/var/cache/votorola/v/out/vocount/</A>

And here's an example of what vote mirroring looks like, for the user.
The red dotted votes are mirror images.
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace/?u=Mike-ZeleaCom&amp;p=edor">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace/?u=Mike-ZeleaCom&amp;p=edor</A>

The results combine votes from 4 pollservers, 3 remote + 1 local.

&gt;<i> .. Hopefully soon Votorola will import Adhocracy's votes.
</I>
(Let me know if it's a priority.  It might take a couple days or more,
 depending on how Friedrich is exporting.)

That's true.  But I couldn't find anything useful in EML.  They're
concerned with traditional elections, mostly.  They already know what
the top-side of a traditional democracy looks like (we all do, it's
the status quo) so they took a bottom-up, data-centric approach.

<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture#Other_approaches">http://u.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture#Other_approaches</A>

OPOL and xDebate are more forward looking, but they take a similar
data-centric approach, and again I couldn't use them for much.  IMHO
it's premature to standardize the data, when we don't know what the
applications on top look like.

So our own approach is to prototype mostly from the top down.  We try
to hack the whole thing into a roughly workable shape - and make it
actually work - before firming up the nitty-gritty details.
