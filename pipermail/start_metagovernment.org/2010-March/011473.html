<PRE>Ed, it seems to me what we are talking about here are &quot;personal performance
plans&quot; in support of Metagov's strategic plan (goals and objectives).  I
agree that what we call the concept is not so as important as what we do
about it.  However, it does seem to me that: 

a) we are more likely to that to which we have personally and publicly
committed and 

b) it is good practice to document our plans (in an open format like
StratML) for the benefit of others with whom we aim to collaborate.  

Note that no one needs to vote or agree on anything.  All that is required
is to *do* something that is supportive of a common objective(s).  The
results (or lack thereof) will speak far more powerfully than any vote tally
or &quot;agreement&quot; can.

Owen

That sounds good. In any event, the core issue is not as much as what  
to call it but what to do about it.

If I recall, the proposal is to create some sort of more formal  
arrangement between Metagov and Active projects such that each has a  
defined role in relation to the other.

For example:

Active Projects:
- display an affiliation blurb or logo on their websites
- commit to a certain level of participation on the list, wiki, etc.
- commit to participation in the Standardization project (even if only  
as a critic or nay-sayer)
- mention Metagov and other Active projects at conferences or when  
otherwise given the opportunity
- pay a small amount of monthly or annual dues (sounds controversial)

Metagovernment:
- actively promotes all projects (and the general principles of  
collaborative governance) on the web, at conferences, etc.
- seeks out opportunities to promote specific projects where appropriate
- encourages each of its individual members to commit some time to at  
least one active project
- coordinates the Standardization project
- seeks out additional forms of cooperation between some or all  
projects; actively promotes synergy when possible
- works toward hosting a conference to promote collaborative  
governance and the active projects

Can others please respond to, criticize, or enhance this list?

Thanks.
