<PRE>The document Owen links to is a bit dated. Our mission and vision are  
clearly defined here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>

We are now beginning the process of defining goals &amp; objectives which  
will help instantiate that mission and bring about that vision. We  
could use whatever help we can get in going about that process. :)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks Owen cc Ed and Jonathan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Owen: your second sentence says it all - few people get beyond  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;talking about&quot; collaboration and actually &quot;doing it&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, we've been trying to understand what we need to do to get  
</I>&gt;<i> people willing and motivated to actually collaborate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having a VERY simple, commonly understood language (PRUB) is a key  
</I>&gt;<i> step in the right direction.  It's not sufficient on it's own (hence  
</I>&gt;<i> our full OpenStrategy system), but it's essential (which is part of  
</I>&gt;<i> the motivation for StratML).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm confident that PRUB-strategic-thinking could help clarify  
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov's &quot;objectives&quot;, if only by clarifying what is meant by an  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;objective&quot;.  In our experience, the word &quot;objective&quot; can mean one  
</I>&gt;<i> of many different things on the continuum between &quot;a good idea to do  
</I>&gt;<i> something&quot; right through to &quot;a Benefit for end users&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is precisely why we use the very exact words of Projects,  
</I>&gt;<i> Results, Uses and Benefits when we &quot;translate&quot; people's Objectives  
</I>&gt;<i> into these categories.  Over and over again (perhaps 90% of the  
</I>&gt;<i> time), we find that people's &quot;objectives&quot; are what we would  
</I>&gt;<i> categorise as &quot;Results&quot; (or even &quot;Projects&quot;) which are relatively  
</I>&gt;<i> early on the idea-Benefit continuum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to gain clarity and exactness on the idea-Benefit  
</I>&gt;<i> continuum, we therefore encourage people to avoid the use of words  
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;objectives&quot; and &quot;goals&quot;, and instead use the more precise PRUB  
</I>&gt;<i> terminology.  In doing so, it then becomes straightforward to  
</I>&gt;<i> complete the full PRUB sequence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In particular, it's essential to understand &quot;Uses&quot;  (and in so  
</I>&gt;<i> doing, to become &quot;user/citizen focused&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ONLY Uses create Benefits/outcomes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Projects don't create Benefits/outcomes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Results don't create Benefits/outcomes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So irrespective of how beautiful a Result might be, if it isn't Used  
</I>&gt;<i> then there won't be any Benefits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore if people are going to define their &quot;objectives&quot; as what  
</I>&gt;<i> we would call Projects, then unless they unequivocally link them  
</I>&gt;<i> through Results and Uses to Benefits, they are probably wasting  
</I>&gt;<i> their time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does MetaGov have a list of &quot;objectives&quot;?   If so, and if it's not  
</I>&gt;<i> too long, then I'd be happy to review the list and categorise them  
</I>&gt;<i> as Projects, Results, Uses or Benefits.  Based on our experience,  
</I>&gt;<i> organisations usually find such a categorisation to be enlightening  
</I>&gt;<i> and helpful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To give you an indication of the stark reality of what we find when  
</I>&gt;<i> we translate organisation's strategies/objectives into the  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenStrategy/PRUB format:
</I>&gt;<i> more than 50% and usually more than 80% of published &quot;strategies&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;Objectives&quot; are in fact Projects or Results
</I>&gt;<i> less than 10% (usually less than 1%) of Uses are defined in any way
</I>&gt;<i> of those few Uses that have been defined, we've practically never  
</I>&gt;<i> found any evidence that the proposed Results will genuinely be Used
</I>&gt;<i> we've similarly found almost no evidence that the defined Uses will  
</I>&gt;<i> actually generate any Benefits
</I>&gt;<i> almost no Users have been involved in the preparation of the  
</I>&gt;<i> strategy/objectives documents
</I>&gt;<i> fewer than 10% of objectives are linked in any way to Benefits  
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;outcomes&quot; in government jargon)
</I>&gt;<i> so it's hardly surprising that (in our observation) at least 90% of  
</I>&gt;<i> strategies make absolutely no difference
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my offer is there if MetaGov wish to take it up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Very insightful comments, Phil &#8230; meaning that they are highly  
</I>&gt;<i> consistent with my own experience, including my experience with the  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenKollab and Metagov folks (not to mention the Systems Dynamics  
</I>&gt;<i> folks, from whose listserv I unsubscribed in frustration).  <A HREF="http://www.systemdynamics.org/">http://www.systemdynamics.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People seem to be much more interested in talking about  
</I>&gt;<i> collaborating than actually doing it to accomplish explicitly  
</I>&gt;<i> documented objectives whose results (outputs) and benefits  
</I>&gt;<i> (outcomes) can be measured and reported.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have no illusions of changing that fact directly.  However, we do  
</I>&gt;<i> hope that Part 2 of the StratML standard, addressing the elements of  
</I>&gt;<i> performance plans and reports, will help to make reality more  
</I>&gt;<i> salient to stakeholders &#8211; in which case *they* will take steps to  
</I>&gt;<i> change it &#8230; if they care to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m copying Ed in the event there may be any prospects for using  
</I>&gt;<i> your application to help the Metagov folks focus on sub-strategies

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: OpenStrategy as a form of OpenKollab
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear OpenKollab members
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've just joined OpenKollab and am not sure of the protocols for  
</I>&gt;<i> posting so I hope I'm doing the right thing here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenKollab totally resonates with us as we've been doing open  
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration for about 10 years and have built up a detailed, fully  
</I>&gt;<i> functioning multi-stakeholder strategy development system -  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenStrategy (there is some basic information on www.openstrategies.com 
</I>&gt;<i>  - we'll update this site by May)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This email is not a commercial for OpenStrategy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just sharing some of the enormous amount we've learned about  
</I>&gt;<i> what does and doesn't work with realpeople in collaborative multi- 
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholder groups (we have much more learning than what I've  
</I>&gt;<i> summarised below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If nothing else, we've learned that what's technologically possible  
</I>&gt;<i> is almost irrelevant - it's what real-world people are actually  
</I>&gt;<i> prepared to do that is the overwhelming constraining factor in large- 
</I>&gt;<i> scale collaboration.  Indeed our OpenStrategy system is perhaps 90%  
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy, psychology and sociology and 10% technology (primarily  
</I>&gt;<i> our web-tool).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our &quot;collaboration space&quot; relates to large-scale, multi-stakeholder  
</I>&gt;<i> groups, typically in the public sector in the UK (we have an Oxford  
</I>&gt;<i> office) and NZ (head office Christchurch).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, we typically work with groups of say 100 organisations  
</I>&gt;<i> who are trying to collaboratively create and implement large scale  
</I>&gt;<i> strategies (eg a county-wide Children and Young Person's strategy, a  
</I>&gt;<i> City Sustainable Community strategy, a multi-city Health Improvement  
</I>&gt;<i> strategy or a regional Climate Change strategy).  We find that:
</I>&gt;<i> most stakeholders say they want to collaborate (it's such a lovely  
</I>&gt;<i> warm concept, mmmmm), perhaps 95% will attend collaborative  
</I>&gt;<i> workshops and talk about collaboration, and perhaps 5% willactually  
</I>&gt;<i> collaborate in small groups of 2-3 organisations (collaborative  
</I>&gt;<i> doing is utterly different from collaborative chatting or  
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative data collecting/archiving/sharing) (and maybe 50% will  
</I>&gt;<i> give advice on how others should collaborate.... there is no  
</I>&gt;<i> shortage of advice, just a shortage of effective working  
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration systems)
</I>&gt;<i> most organisational stakeholders want to continue to work inside  
</I>&gt;<i> their own organisational silos (they usually have to, for financial  
</I>&gt;<i> accountability reasons), so the challenge is to &quot;join up the silos&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> not&quot;break down the silos&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> there must be a common language when people wish to collaborate.
</I>&gt;<i> In collaborative strategy-space with hundreds of stakeholders, we  
</I>&gt;<i> can't work collaboratively with a plethora of words such as  
</I>&gt;<i> objectives, goals, outputs, outcomes, targets, visions, mission,  
</I>&gt;<i> drivers for change, structures, frameworks, thought-pieces,....  
</I>&gt;<i> specially when they all mean different things to different people  
</I>&gt;<i> (see also StratML - Strategic Markup Language being developed by  
</I>&gt;<i> AIIM and driven by Owen Ambur)
</I>&gt;<i> cognitively, average humans can readily handle 4 +/- 2 pieces of  
</I>&gt;<i> information, so for real-world people there is not much point  
</I>&gt;<i> developing sophisticated collaboration systems based on more complex  
</I>&gt;<i> data sets - they may be meaningful to the tiny percentage of people  
</I>&gt;<i> who are large-scale integrators (often INTJs), but most people in a  
</I>&gt;<i> normal community think and work on a much smaller scale.
</I>&gt;<i> If we want stakeholders to engage and to actually collaborate (as  
</I>&gt;<i> distinct from talk about it), we have to develop collaboration  
</I>&gt;<i> systems that they can get their heads around (if you've read this  
</I>&gt;<i> far, can I plead with you to seriously consider this issue so that  
</I>&gt;<i> your collective brainpower can be brought to bear on creating  
</I>&gt;<i> simple, pragmatic/practical collaboration systems that can genuinely  
</I>&gt;<i> enable large-scale, real-world communities to plan/strategise/ 
</I>&gt;<i> implement effectively to make this world a better place)
</I>&gt;<i> so for effective large-scale strategy/planning collaboration (as  
</I>&gt;<i> distinct from social discussion networks) we need to identify an  
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly defined sub-set of information which meets the following  
</I>&gt;<i> criteria:
</I>&gt;<i> it is the smallest set of information
</I>&gt;<i> which has the highest value
</I>&gt;<i> to the most people
</I>&gt;<i> we are now confident that this subset is (we think, universally)  
</I>&gt;<i> what we call PRUB:
</I>&gt;<i> Organisations run Projects     (organisational action)
</I>&gt;<i> that produce Results            (organisational consequence)
</I>&gt;<i> that communities Use        (community action)
</I>&gt;<i> to create Benefits for themselves        (community consequence)
</I>&gt;<i> all other information is of lower value to the collective of  
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders, although individual bits of information will have  
</I>&gt;<i> higher value to individuals
</I>&gt;<i> an interlinked set of PRUBs is what we call a SubStrategy
</I>&gt;<i> a collection of SubStrategies is what we call an OpenStrategy
</I>&gt;<i> to create a strategy, start with Benefits and work back to Projects  
</I>&gt;<i> (BURP)
</I>&gt;<i> to implement a strategy, start with Projects and work through to  
</I>&gt;<i> Benefits (PRUB)
</I>&gt;<i> so PRUB/SubStrategies/OpenStrategies are simultaneously strategies  
</I>&gt;<i> (BURP) and implementation plans (PRUB)
</I>&gt;<i> they enable stakeholders to explicitly define exactly what they are  
</I>&gt;<i> doing (as SubStrategies) and readily share them with other  
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders via our on-line OpenStrategy web-tool
</I>&gt;<i> other stakeholders can search the OpenStrategy to find SubStrategies  
</I>&gt;<i> of interest to them, contact the Project leaders and start  
</I>&gt;<i> collaborating (along the same lines of open source software projects  
</I>&gt;<i> - a programmer kicks off with a good idea and others collaborate by  
</I>&gt;<i> clustering around them)
</I>&gt;<i> so practical collaboration is a &quot;voluntary engaging of the willing  
</I>&gt;<i> with the willing&quot;, and it usually happens on a rather small scale
</I>&gt;<i> it's worth considering the mathematics of multi-stakeholder  
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration on multiple topics based on the idea of 'networking'  
</I>&gt;<i> of stakeholders:  if 100 organisations wish to collaborate on 50  
</I>&gt;<i> topics by talking to each other just 6 times per year on each topic,  
</I>&gt;<i> this amounts to about 1,500,000 conversations.... - is that really  
</I>&gt;<i> going to happen effectively - and make any difference in the world?   
</I>&gt;<i> What happens to the content of the communications?
</I>&gt;<i> We put forward the following concept:
</I>&gt;<i> Type 1 collaborative strategy = hierarchy of people - someone at  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the top&quot; creates/coordinates it: doesn't work unless top dogs have  
</I>&gt;<i> huge power (in which case they get their way, which seldom means  
</I>&gt;<i> that communities get the Benefits they want)
</I>&gt;<i> Type 2 collaborative strategy = networks of people:  mathematically  
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to network everyone effectively on all topics (as shown  
</I>&gt;<i> above)
</I>&gt;<i> Type 3 collaborative strategy = networks of ideas (eg SubStrategies/ 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenStrategies) so that stakeholders share what they are doing in an  
</I>&gt;<i> on-line OpenStrategy and other stakeholders cluster around them:  
</I>&gt;<i> mathematically very doable - even a complex community will have at  
</I>&gt;<i> most a few thousand SubStrategies and usually only a few hundred  
</I>&gt;<i> (this is important.  Some people want to add more information than  
</I>&gt;<i> just PRUB - but think about it - if a multi-stakeholder group has  
</I>&gt;<i> 500 Projects (and hence 4-500 SubStrategies), that's about 2000  
</I>&gt;<i> PRUBs.  In our system, we also have &quot;Links&quot; between each P, R, U, B  
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;Evidence&quot; for each Link - so we're already up to 4-5,000 pieces  
</I>&gt;<i> of information, albeit nicely &quot;chunked up&quot; into meaningful  
</I>&gt;<i> SubStrategies.  We find that any more information than that simply  
</I>&gt;<i> overwhelms multi-stakeholder groups - so as noted earlier, we need  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the smallest amount of information that has the highest value to  
</I>&gt;<i> the most people&quot; - we're convinced this information SubSet is PRUB  
</I>&gt;<i> which can build into a library of SubStrategies = an OpenStrategy
</I>&gt;<i> Our experience shows universally that stakeholders, at all levels,  
</I>&gt;<i> really &quot;get it&quot; with SubStrategies - they can get their heads around  
</I>&gt;<i> the simplicity of PRUB and the slightly more complex concept of  
</I>&gt;<i> SubStrategies (each SubStrategy may contain several inter-linked  
</I>&gt;<i> PRUBs).  Warning: there are many subtleties in PRUB (eg Orphan  
</I>&gt;<i> Results, end-point Results, unwanted Results, evolving Results, non- 
</I>&gt;<i> discretionary Results etc.....) but the core concept of PRUB is  
</I>&gt;<i> utterly robust and effective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that's a helpful set of observations and comments for  
</I>&gt;<i> openkollab members - there is more where that came from!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're totally open to critical feedback as our goal is to keep  
</I>&gt;<i> refining OpenStrategy thinking and improving large scale  
</I>&gt;<i> collaborations to make the world a better place, so I welcome your  
</I>&gt;<i> feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because we're a tiny NZ company struggling to survive, I work long  
</I>&gt;<i> hours holding things together.  I therefore may not have time to  
</I>&gt;<i> respond to everyone's responses to my comments above although I'll  
</I>&gt;<i> do my best (in an hour I'm heading to our West Coast for a Wild  
</I>&gt;<i> Foods Festival so won't be responding for the next 72 hours).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, if anyone is interested in more detail, send me an email (<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">phil at openstrategies.com</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> ) and I'll forward to you a PDF copy of our OpenStrategy book (it's  
</I>&gt;<i> a few years old now).  If the principles of OpenStrategy resonate  
</I>&gt;<i> with you I'll then send you a copy of our forthcoming up-date  
</I>&gt;<i> booklet (hopefully available by April).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, if anyone wants to invest in our NZ company to help  
</I>&gt;<i> keep us afloat, please don't hesitate to email me (we're currently  
</I>&gt;<i> seeking about $US250,000 to fund company growth, primarily in the UK).
