&gt;<i> Are you saying all decisions about &quot;Public Works&quot; are always correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>of course not ! I was simply trying to tell that humans are often 
vicious, and if you give them the oportunity to circumvent the rules, 
they usualy do it...
  
&gt;<i> What if I would rather not pay for my country's Department Of Offense
</I>&gt;<i> (DOO) attacking the citizens of Afghanistan?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'm 100% ok with you on this example.
I understand that the &quot;opt-in&quot; arrangement would especialy fit to 
decisions that doesn't concern country's equipment.

&gt;<i> If governments always make the right decisions already, then what is
</I>&gt;<i> the goal of MetaGovernment?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
hope you have understand what I mean, and it is just to emphasize that 
democracy is probably something impossible at this stage of  human 
development... I'm very sad to say that.
The good news is that MG has a huge avenue to go.

&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do we have to barred it ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but I don't understand what you mean here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I was just saying that to maintain equity between the 99% who have payed 
for the &quot;Recreation Center&quot; and the 1% of who didn't payed do we have to 
block the access of the 1% to this &quot;Recreation Center&quot; ?
of course not ! So I just see here a breach where malicious would enter.


Best regards

Philippe
