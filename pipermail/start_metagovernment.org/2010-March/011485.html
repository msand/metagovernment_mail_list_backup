<PRE>Hello everybody,

I agree.

If I correctly translate &quot;have a hard time wrapping our heads around it&quot; 
as &quot;difficult to understand&quot;, than the best way to contribute imo is 
first to try to understand. Which is actually really easy:

Right now the different tools treat the votes somehow as &quot;*their*&quot; votes 
and isolate them *inside *their tools from the votes of the other tools.
Compared to our email-list this would mean: Since I use Thunderbird I 
can only read emails in our list, that were written with Thunderbird. 
And I'd have to additionally install OutlookExpress to read some other 
emails. But that would be really annoying.
The better solution is what we have now: I can read all the emails with 
my Thunderbird regardless what they were written whith.
A good metaphor for the voting could be a circular dome with many 
portals. The different voting tools are the portals and the space 
between them, the space inside the dome, is where all the votes and 
proposals of all the voters freely float. In this shared space they are 
visible for everybody from every portal.

The only requirement for that is a vote mirror for each pair of engines 
and a commonly shared registration facility.

More details here:
