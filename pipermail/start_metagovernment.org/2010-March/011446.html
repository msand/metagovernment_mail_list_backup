Well, to be fair, the entire cost of the project is US$5 per month for  
a hosting account, plus about $10 a year for the domain name. But I do  
agree that those things should not be controlled solely by me, and I  
have been looking forward to the opportunity to cede them to the  
collective governance of the group. I just haven't figured out how  
yet. For me to cede control, it has to be to something, such as an  
organization. And in most countries, an organization has to have  
specific, designated leaders; which violates the basic principles of  
this project.

Separately, as far as total ownership goes, it may not be reasonable  
to own our own computers. The cost of operating a data center is very  
heavy... much more than the computers themselves. And no matter how  
much we own, we still can't own the internet (not yet anyway; though I  
guess perhaps some day it can be controlled by collaborative  
governance). Even if we were to buy a computer and set it up, we would  
still need to buy connectivity to the net.

&gt;<i> We need to learn how to Get Together for our own, collaborative

Personally, I don't want to get into a capitalism-is-bad line of  
thought. Regardless of the merit of the idea, this project is open to  
everyone in the world, and shouldn't take stands on issues that are  
tangential to it.

That said, however, it certainly makes sense for us to manage our  
finances as we manage ourselves: collaboratively. A very intriguing  
model is E-Text Editor, &quot;the open company,&quot; which is a for-profit  
company that anyone can contribute to and benefit from:

It has been a year since they announced they were going open, and I  
don't know what has become of it since then. If someone would like to  
contact them, perhaps we could compare notes.

Alternatively, there is the much more established concept of the  
Cooperative:

I simply haven't had the time to delve into the idea and see how we  
could apply it here.
