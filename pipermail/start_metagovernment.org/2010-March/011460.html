<PRE>Regardless of whether it is in a meeting or on this list; I would like  
to move ahead with discussing our Goals &amp; Objectives.

Have others had a chance to look at Mat&#237;as' post below, and do you  
have any reactions?

Thanks.

&gt;<i> Answering this question may lead us to more answers, for example, to
</I>&gt;<i> the inquietudes 'What really does Metagovernment?' and 'What we have
</I>&gt;<i> to do to increase participation?'; which in turn would help us to
</I>&gt;<i> define objectives and goals (thanks Owen for pushing this out) that
</I>&gt;<i> would make possible the accomplishment of our vision. I transcribe
</I>&gt;<i> here what you can read in Wikipedia about umbrellas:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;An umbrella organization is an association of (often related,
</I>&gt;<i> industry-specific) institutions, who work together formally to
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate activities or pool resources. In business, political, or
</I>&gt;<i> other environments, one group, the umbrella organization, provides
</I>&gt;<i> resources and often an identity to the smaller organizations.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes in this kind of arrangement, the umbrella organization is to
</I>&gt;<i> some degree responsible for the groups under its care. Compare to
</I>&gt;<i> franchises and subsidiaries. There may be many reasons for
</I>&gt;<i> establishing/joining an umbrella organization;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to carry out activities which could not be accomplished
</I>&gt;<i> alone, due to:
</I>&gt;<i> * economies of scale,
</I>&gt;<i> * a better pool of experts and experience,
</I>&gt;<i> * shared apprenticeship and exchange of know-how;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a sense of community and support that makes people and corporations
</I>&gt;<i> derive utility from multilateral and shared activities:
</I>&gt;<i> * an increased brand/public awareness,
</I>&gt;<i> * legality of pursued action(s).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's work this out analyzing it by parts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;An umbrella organization is an association&quot;, then we should have a
</I>&gt;<i> contract with active projects, specifying roles and obligations, this
</I>&gt;<i> way we know when the association starts and ends.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;who work together formally to coordinate activities or pool
</I>&gt;<i> resources&quot;, Metagovernment has the kind of activities that could be
</I>&gt;<i> coordinated, like the Conference or the Standardization. Obligations:
</I>&gt;<i> we do the coordination, then the active projects follow the plans
</I>&gt;<i> (top-down); active projects tell us what to coordinate (down-top).
</I>&gt;<i> Pooling resources... this is harder; what can active projects actually
</I>&gt;<i> throw in a common pool?
</I>&gt;<i> * Work force. Difficult, programmers have enough with its own  
</I>&gt;<i> projects.
</I>&gt;<i> * Knowledge. Maybe. Not about programming, there are better resources
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere. About voting systems, could be.
</I>&gt;<i> * Money. Even worse. As an individual, I feel I should donate; what
</I>&gt;<i> about a $10 monthly fee, for those members who want to do it? Let's
</I>&gt;<i> open the road for that, using a PayPal account. (Ed's?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;provides resources and often an identity to the smaller
</I>&gt;<i> organizations&quot;, Resources, mmm, we don't have much to offer, the wiki
</I>&gt;<i> and some space in the server. We could take this further, if we had a
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated server or a virtual private server ($700 yearly) to expand
</I>&gt;<i> our services. Obligations: provide free full hosting to active
</I>&gt;<i> projects, while they use this service exclusively for developing
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance projects. (Identity? Well, in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment isn't famous... yet, and identity happens when others
</I>&gt;<i> recognize you.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the umbrella organization is to some degree responsible for the
</I>&gt;<i> groups under its care&quot;, sometimes, not this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the ability to carry out activities which could not be accomplished
</I>&gt;<i> alone&quot;, can you add one more activity?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a sense of community and support that makes people and corporations
</I>&gt;<i> derive utility from multilateral and shared activities&quot;, ...public
</I>&gt;<i> awareness... Obligation: Metagovernment maintains a list of active
</I>&gt;<i> projects in the wiki's main page, active projects add a little banner
</I>&gt;<i> of Metagovernment on their sites. If we go to a conference, we present
</I>&gt;<i> all active projects, if an active project goes to a conference, it
</I>&gt;<i> introduces Metagovernment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I invite you to enhance to list of things that Metagovernment can do
</I>&gt;<i> for its active projects, and vice versa.
