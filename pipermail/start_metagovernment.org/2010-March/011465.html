<PRE>Mat&#237;as, since the StratML standard was only recently issued and it is not
yet clear how widely it may be adopted, search services have not yet arisen
to take full advantage of it.  However, since StratML documents are plain
(XML) text posted on the Web, they are indexed by Google and other full-text
search engines.  See, for example, the Google query field at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Services">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Services</A>  

 

HTML is about the *presentation* of information on the Web, e.g., displaying
text in bold, italics, or paragraphs.  

 

XML is about the *meaning* of the elements, e.g., a mission or goal
statement, the name of a person, a date, a number that is an amount of
currency (money), etc.

 

XHTML can encompass both.  However, using style sheets in combination with
XML is more flexible than hard coding presentation into the files
themselves.  See, for example, the several renditions of former President
Bush&#146;s management agenda at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#PMA">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#PMA</A> (two of
which are HTML automatically rendered from the original XML source).

 

While I will be happy to include in the StratML collection any plan the
subscribers to this listserv may wish to compile, the intent is that StratML
documents can be posted anywhere on the Web and, eventually, indexed by
intermediary services equipped to take full advantage of the intelligence
(meaning) they contain for the benefit of various communities of interest.

 

BTW, since Google has built its competitive advantage on full-text search
algorithms, they may not be among the most likely candidates to leverage the
internal logic of StratML documents (or other XML files based upon schemas).
However, if they don&#146;t, it is only a matter of time before others do so and
current search services become relics of the past.

[mailto:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start-bounces at metagovernment.org</A>] On Behalf Of Mat&#237;as Battocchia

Subject: [MG] Goals &amp; Objectives (StratML)

 

I never said much about StartML because I didn't understand its potential;
some days ago I wrote my first web page, that is about a project, and I
wanted that it were findable by others, or in other words, indexed by
Google. If there exists a search engine for projects, surely I would want to
have some way to tell the engine &quot;this paragraph is the mission, and this
one the plans, etc&quot;. Although this idea is more related to the W3C eGov
group's, right? To have HTML elements to accomplish this. 

I don't see why we couldn't contribute with StratML project, we have to
write down our goals and plans anyway, just we have to mark them up and
submit them to the StratML site.
