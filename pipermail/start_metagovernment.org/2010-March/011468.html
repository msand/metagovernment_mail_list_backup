<PRE>Ah; I had not realized there was a mixup in the attendee list.

Well in any event, as I said I will not be organizing a meeting for  
this weekend (2 weeks after the last), but if someone else wants to, I  
will attend.

I do intend to organize a meeting in another 2 weeks... trying out a  
monthly format.

I welcome any input on anything about meetings. I very much would like  
to see us get rolling on the central issue of goals &amp; objectives.

</I>&gt;<i> Previously I had questioned the idea of having meetings as

</I>&gt;<i> So we held a meeting a week ago, and most of the people who said

</I>&gt;<i> Those of us who were there did have a nice chat, but there was no
