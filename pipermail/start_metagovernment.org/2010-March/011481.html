However, it would be nice if Active projects would take the minor step  
of acknowledging some sort of relationship with Metagov beyond the  
Metagov website. Even if only to have a scrap of small text at the  
bottom of their About page or whatnot... something to show that the  
relationship isn't entirely in Metagov's head, and not really believed  
by the active projects.

&gt;&gt;<i> Metagovernment:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - coordinates the Standardization project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - seeks out additional forms of cooperation between some or all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects; actively promotes synergy when possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - works toward hosting a conference to promote collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance and the active projects
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That might be too ambitious.  You might not have the resources for all
</I>&gt;<i> that.  Maybe just pick one task, and try to move it forward.  Aim for
</I>&gt;<i> results (as Owen suggests) and see what happens.
</I>
Well, taking the above in order... I do as much as I can for both of  
the first two. My time has been incredibly tight for quite a long time  
now, but I still do what I can in my spare time. It isn't that  
difficult for other members to at least put in a word for Metagov or  
for a particular project from time to time.

The third point above isn't as much as an objective as just a  
generally good idea.

The fourth, the Standardization project, I think is our most tangible  
and beneficial potential near-time objective. And Michael, you have  
been the lead on that. I would like to encourage others to contribute  
to it, but I think many (including myself) have had a hard time  
wrapping our heads around it. Is it something others could contribute  
to, and if so, could you help us understand how?

I can see tabling the conference for the moment; but I do believe that  
regular meetings can help bring about better understanding of the  
active projects. I am hopeful that a monthly meeting will be a little  
more popular than the biweekly ones have been. (Which, btw, means  
April 3 or 4 should be the next meeting.)
