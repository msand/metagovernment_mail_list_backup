<PRE>Hi there, I'm campaign manager for a political campaign based around
the UK general election (probably May 6). We're trying to get a
candidate in one of London's seats standing on a platform of genuine
collaborative democracy. Our website is www.tothecommons.com. That'll
point you to the twitter, facebook etc too.

Our first unpolitical unbroadcast is at
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akJIEksSUZI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akJIEksSUZI</A>

We're looking to connect and learn from all those who have gone before.

Thanks and hope to hear from someone soon. Been so inspired to
discover all these great examples here on metagovernment.org.

Best wishes

Jeremy
