Control rests finally in property ownership.

Owning physical sources gives you control of the results.

In this specific instance, I have no property ownership in the
computers hosting that software, and I don't help pay any of the real
costs to maintain them, so can only hope whoever is paying will let me
keep playing.

Each of us owns the sources of almost NONE of our needs.  It is too
difficult all alone.  Not only the difficulty of fully utilizing the
tools, but also a lack of advanced skills needed to perform some sorts
of work.

We need to learn how to Get Together for our own, collaborative
benefit instead of shaping our notion of exchange as one of predation
and advantage.

I like Ed's mention of a &quot;funding mechanism&quot;.

If we could help interested parties communicate, those groups could
more easily buy Physical Sources and hold them as &quot;Collaborative
Property&quot; for the purpose of Use Value alone.

We could then buy and build farms, daries, factories, theatres,
go-cart tracks, etc.

But since we (each group) would own them outright, then the price
would be the simple costs of operation and profit would be zero.

This is fine for the static case, but once a non-owner wants access,
then we must have a rule about profit.  For profit is a measure of
payer dependence, and so should be treated as his pre-payment toward
the purchase of more physical sources.

When profit becomes payer property, then collaboration is perpetuated.

This way we can grow in a strange way that avoids the overaccumulation
that Capitalism suffers.
