<PRE>Previously I had questioned the idea of having meetings as frequently  
as every two weeks. Several people spoke in favor of the format, and  
we decided to hold a meeting if at least five people committed to come.

So we held a meeting a week ago, and most of the people who said they  
would come and/or who voiced approval of the format... did not come to  
the meeting.

Those of us who were there did have a nice chat, but there was no  
point tackling the stated agenda centered around Goals &amp; Objectives,  
since two participants two of the other three participants were not  
particularly active or up-to-date on this project's activities.

So with that said, I would like to propose that meetings only be  
monthly. And I would further like to ask that people be more careful  
with stating whether or not they will be attending.

If others would like to have meetings more frequently, then please do  
arrange one. I will almost certainly attend.

Thanks.
