As Pietro noted, we currently operate as an adhocracy, so anyone has  
as much control as they wish to express.
See: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Adhocracy">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Adhocracy</A>

This likely will change if we can migrate to collaborative governance  
(at which point, you will still have as much say as you wish to  
express, by being able to make proposals or to break consensus).

&gt;<i> My explanation for this lack of control has to do with how traditional
</I>&gt;<i> taxation and donations do not let the individual 'target' those
</I>&gt;<i> investments toward what he thinks are important, but are instead put
</I>&gt;<i> into a sort of &quot;slush fund&quot; that a well-intentioned committee or other
</I>&gt;<i> 'representative' then uses as THEY see fit.
</I>
Since the beginning of this project, it has been my belief that a  
universal solution to this sort of problem is to require every  
proposal to state its funding mechanism. This applies not just to  
Metagovernment, but to any proposal in any organization.

The United States state of California is currently laboring under  
enormous funding deficits because they have public referenda where  
they ask if people want this or that to be enacted into law... but  
they don't include the funding in the proposal. People vote in favor  
of it, but then the state goes broke because now they have to pay for  
this ridiculous law. If the proposal instead said: Do you want to pay  
an extra 1% tax on everything you buy in order to do X, I would bet a  
lot fewer of these &quot;unfunded mandates&quot; would pass.

See: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Funding">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Funding</A>

&gt;<i> But I *would* be willing to send money and add value in other ways IF
</I>&gt;<i> I have the control to *target* that value, and also to gain real
</I>&gt;<i> ownership in the Physical Sources (Material Assets) used to host the
</I>&gt;<i> MG activity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, toward answering the other parts of this email about pooling
</I>&gt;<i> resources I present a challenge:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could we host an instance of <A HREF="http://EtherPad.GoogleCode.com">http://EtherPad.GoogleCode.com</A> server,
</I>&gt;<i> and if so, how and who would pay those extra costs?
</I>
Under adhocracy, the way to get such a project started would be to  
simply pay for it yourself if you think it should be done.

However, seeing as EtherPad is open source and Jacki is setting up an  
account for us on TuxFamily.org: an instance of EtherPad could be set  
up there at no charge.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-February/002596.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-February/002596.html</A>
Jacki, if you're monitoring this thread... is the hosting account set  
up yet?

Apart from that solution however, the original post in this thread  
(Mat&#237;as' post about umbrella organizations) includes a proposal for  
collecting money. I think this is an ideal opportunity for us to test  
our mettle... we just need something that actually would cost money.  
The EtherPad instance should be doable for free.
