<PRE>Dear Matias,
let me share with you why I don't see StratML as being revolutionary.

And I am open to be explained why I am wrong.

The key question is: &quot;who would fill in the StratML?&quot;:
if each person would fill in the StratML for himself each person would
tailor it to make themselves more attractive.

Do you remember when there were keywords among the metadata that would
describe a page. Google started using them (or was it altavista?). Then they
stopped. You know why? Because the keywords stopped representing what the
page really was about. In other word if you added the word &quot;sex&quot; among your
keyword your internet traffic would go up. And suddenly many pages where
about sex, except that they weren't.

So the other option would be to have a central agency to compile those
StratML. This has all sort of problems, from cultural problems (you decide
for me what I am about?), to honesty problems (I pay the agency so that I
can have among the description something which I know would make me more
attractive). At least Google made all this public by selling the adwords to
the highest bidder. But we have moved from having words that represent
something to having the best words you can buy (among the ones that are
somehow tangent). I remember recently a tribunal case when a car company
protested because another car company used the name of the first car company
as their ad word. Like saying that &quot;Ford&quot; has as a description &quot;BMW&quot;.

So I personally would rule out also the idea of having a central agency.

So what other solution do we have?
Well Tags, and tag clouds can be used to find the distance between web
pages. They are being generated by a whole lot of people. No one is in
charge, and the position depends upon the culture. As the culture change so
does the position. This would be ok, but StratML is not set up to use tags
and tag clouds. And tag and tag clouds only give spurious information.

What other options do we have?
We could have the StratML page being a collaborative work. Sort of a wiki.
Or a Vilfredo where you set up a question for each part of the xML page.
Maybe this would work. But it would be a massive effort. Every company would
invest as much as possible in controlling their StratML page. Not to
represent them, but to have maximum visibility. In a wiki either the wiki is
very popular (like wikipedia where although politician try to change their
page they can't. And the US parliament has by now being banned from having
the possibility to edit wikipedia), of each person will effectively have
control over the page describing them.

Maybe we could set up something with voting, or as I mentioned above with
Vilfredo.

But by now you have seen that at the end the problem with StratML is the
same problem we are facing everywhere: &quot;how do you get a group of people to
reach a consensual conclusion between them?&quot; This is a HARD problem, it
hasn't been solved well enough. So any idea to build on top of it has weak
foundation.

And this is what's wrong (for now -!-) with StratML.
Once we have found a way to write those documents collaboratively in a way
that no one is excluded, and no one dominates, then we can build a lot of
things on top of them. New laws, new poems, new descriptions about the
world,
and also StratML documents.
