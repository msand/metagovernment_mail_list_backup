<PRE>What I'm going to propose now, is not really a new objective, but is a new
way to achieve our actual main objective, that is being a fine umbrella for
collaborative governance projects.

The idea is to create a consortium. This is different from renaming
Metagovernment, it requires our crew to code and maintain another website.
(After its born the fate of Metagovernment could be discussed. The
consortium's maintenance team could carry the name, our we could find us new
missions...)

Giving it a good name is crucial, bear with me... (Inviting all the related
projects to the list is another goal. Populating the umbrella makes it an
umbrella, if we can't bring them in, then we don't have one.) We have
invited some related projects to join before, but just a part of them
actually did it. A possible reason is that for many, joining seems useless.
(Then we should have a better invitation letter, that exposes the benefits
of being in the collaborative governance project's hub.) Another, which is
something I've felt, and I don't know if it's a common feeling between
humans, is a reason related with pride: not forming part of a group because
you don't like its name (it sound absurd, isn't it?), also, not letting the
organization you've started being absorbed by another one (started by
someone else) (which of course is a fallacy in this particular case because
Metagovernment doesn't eat any projects; a misconception to be cleared in
the letter too?).

&quot;Consortium&quot; is the best term we can used to avoid these problems. It's
incomplete. Personally I'm not sure of &quot;collaborative governance&quot; as the
best option to complete it. I shall analyze all the related projects'
websites and come with the most common definition of what we're promoting by
this weekend... if the list thinks I'm not a person that have a serious
problem with naming; in that case I'd rather start therapy. :P
