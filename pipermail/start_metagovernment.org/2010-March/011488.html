<PRE>Hello,

@Owen

Those links are very interesting and worth looking at. But I think, they 
are not so much about standards for exchange formats between different 
tools.

@Philippe
&gt;<i> I don't know if voting protocols have been already describe in an RFC. 
</I>&gt;<i> It could also a way to explore in order to be able to share Votes 
</I>&gt;<i> amongst voting tools.
</I>
AKAIK we are the only ones who even talk about this stuff. It would be a 
big surprise for me to find out, that others have actually gone beyond 
talking to actually doing, i.e. agreeing to standards.
Also meanwhile I doubt, that this is the usual way, such standards 
emerge. I picture the evolution of a standard now more like this: the 
first two tools on the market agree on their specific vote-mirror. A 
third comes in and maybe creates a second and a third vote-mirror to the 
other two tools, ... At some point new tools will adapt to one of the 
already existing mirrors. And the more adapt to one version, the more 
this becomes the inofficial standard.

Until now only Votorola did succesful tests with Vote-import. And only 
Votorola and Adhocracy are doing Vote-export. Hopefully soon Votorola 
will import Adhocracy's votes.

Best,
Thomas
