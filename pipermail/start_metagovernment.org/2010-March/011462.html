<PRE>Sorry to have been out of touch lately.  My wife and I were on a 24-day tour
of New Zealand and Australia.  We're still recovering from jet lag.

In general, I agree with what Mat&#237;as is proposing.  One difference is that I
would not use the word &quot;contract&quot; since it implies authority we do not have
(and I suspect that most of us do not desire).
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract</A>  Instead, I'd use the word &quot;plan&quot;.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan</A> 

I do not believe we need to establish any large objectives.  Indeed, if we
were to try to do so, I'm pretty sure we'd fail.  However, I do believe we
should establish some relatively small objectives against which progress (or
lack thereof) can be measured.  If we do that, the results will speak for
themselves (and we can each decide for ourselves whether they are worth the
continued investment of our time, effort, and perhaps money).

At this point, it is unclear whether we actually have any shared objectives
or not.  For example, I have not seen any evidence that any of the
subscribers to the listserv share my objective of facilitating feedback on
goals and objectives documented on the Web in StratML format (which is the
reason I subscribed in the first place).

To the degree that any number of the subscribers (however small) may agree
upon any particular objective(s), my offer to document it (them) in StratML
format still stands.

Since AIIM's StratML Committee is now specifying Part 2 of the StratML
standard, addressing the elements of performance plans and reports, I would
welcome the opportunity to use Metagov's plan as a pilot test/use case for
it.  Hopefully, it will help organizations like Metagov become more
effective and, in turn, feedback from folks subscribing to organizations
like Metagov will help not only to make the StratML standard better but,
ultimately, to improve the planning and performance processes themselves --
for all organizations worldwide.

Subject: [MG] Goals &amp; Objectives

Regardless of whether it is in a meeting or on this list; I would like  
to move ahead with discussing our Goals &amp; Objectives.

Have others had a chance to look at Mat&#237;as' post below, and do you  
have any reactions?

Thanks.

&gt;<i> Answering this question may lead us to more answers, for example, to

</I>&gt;<i> define objectives and goals (thanks Owen for pushing this out) that
</I>&gt;<i> would make possible the accomplishment of our vision. I transcribe
</I>&gt;<i> here what you can read in Wikipedia about umbrellas:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;An umbrella organization is an association of (often related,
</I>&gt;<i> industry-specific) institutions, who work together formally to
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate activities or pool resources. In business, political, or
</I>&gt;<i> other environments, one group, the umbrella organization, provides
</I>&gt;<i> resources and often an identity to the smaller organizations.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes in this kind of arrangement, the umbrella organization is to
</I>&gt;<i> some degree responsible for the groups under its care. Compare to
</I>&gt;<i> franchises and subsidiaries. There may be many reasons for
</I>&gt;<i> establishing/joining an umbrella organization;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to carry out activities which could not be accomplished
</I>&gt;<i> alone, due to:
</I>&gt;<i> * economies of scale,
</I>&gt;<i> * a better pool of experts and experience,
</I>&gt;<i> * shared apprenticeship and exchange of know-how;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a sense of community and support that makes people and corporations
</I>&gt;<i> derive utility from multilateral and shared activities:
</I>&gt;<i> * an increased brand/public awareness,
</I>&gt;<i> * legality of pursued action(s).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's work this out analyzing it by parts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;An umbrella organization is an association&quot;, then we should have a
</I>&gt;<i> contract with active projects, specifying roles and obligations, this
</I>&gt;<i> way we know when the association starts and ends.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;who work together formally to coordinate activities or pool
</I>&gt;<i> resources&quot;, Metagovernment has the kind of activities that could be
</I>&gt;<i> coordinated, like the Conference or the Standardization. Obligations:
</I>&gt;<i> we do the coordination, then the active projects follow the plans
</I>&gt;<i> (top-down); active projects tell us what to coordinate (down-top).
</I>&gt;<i> Pooling resources... this is harder; what can active projects actually
</I>&gt;<i> throw in a common pool?
</I>&gt;<i> * Work force. Difficult, programmers have enough with its own  
</I>&gt;<i> projects.
</I>&gt;<i> * Knowledge. Maybe. Not about programming, there are better resources
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere. About voting systems, could be.
</I>&gt;<i> * Money. Even worse. As an individual, I feel I should donate; what
</I>&gt;<i> about a $10 monthly fee, for those members who want to do it? Let's
</I>&gt;<i> open the road for that, using a PayPal account. (Ed's?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;provides resources and often an identity to the smaller
</I>&gt;<i> organizations&quot;, Resources, mmm, we don't have much to offer, the wiki
</I>&gt;<i> and some space in the server. We could take this further, if we had a
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated server or a virtual private server ($700 yearly) to expand
</I>&gt;<i> our services. Obligations: provide free full hosting to active
</I>&gt;<i> projects, while they use this service exclusively for developing
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance projects. (Identity? Well, in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment isn't famous... yet, and identity happens when others
</I>&gt;<i> recognize you.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the umbrella organization is to some degree responsible for the
</I>&gt;<i> groups under its care&quot;, sometimes, not this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the ability to carry out activities which could not be accomplished
</I>&gt;<i> alone&quot;, can you add one more activity?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a sense of community and support that makes people and corporations
</I>&gt;<i> derive utility from multilateral and shared activities&quot;, ...public
</I>&gt;<i> awareness... Obligation: Metagovernment maintains a list of active
</I>&gt;<i> projects in the wiki's main page, active projects add a little banner
</I>&gt;<i> of Metagovernment on their sites. If we go to a conference, we present
</I>&gt;<i> all active projects, if an active project goes to a conference, it
</I>&gt;<i> introduces Metagovernment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I invite you to enhance to list of things that Metagovernment can do
</I>&gt;<i> for its active projects, and vice versa.
