<PRE>Hello,

sorry for replying so late. This would be my proposal for the next 
genergation on the CMS question on Vilfredo (my changes are in bold &amp; 
italic):

Proposal:

Metagovernment should use a distributed system. Where different tools 
have different roles. While the roles should be pretty stable, the tools 
used should change from time to time, to permit testing of different 
possible tools.
The roles should be:

    * asking open questions
    * voting on closed questions (with possible types of voting available)
    * a wiki to store the developed wisdom from the group. The wiki
      should use the Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS).
    * A blog for news, announcements, and general informations
    * A set of rules (possibly stored in a protected page of the wiki)
      to define how the information should move from one system to the
      other.
    * A chat system, possibly open 24/7, with some specific times where
      people will be present for meetings.

     Each of those roles should have multiple tools that can be used, 
and care should be taken to organize the system so that different tools 
can be substituted /*or **work in parallel*/.
     A single identity system should be used that permit to the users to 
have the same identity in the various tools used.
     The system should also have a distributed ownership, possible with 
a different domain for each role, a different person controlling each 
domain name, and a different person being responsible for each tool.



We propose to use the following tools:

For the storage of information (wiki and rules): Candiwi, /*Votorola, ...*/
For the open questions: Vilfredo, /*Votorola, ...*/
For closed questions: decide2gether 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.telematicsfreedom.org/it/projects/decide2gether">http://www.telematicsfreedom.org/it/projects/decide2gether</A>&gt; (using a 
Condorcet Voting), /*Votorola*/, /*...*/
For the Blog: A Wordpress.org blog, installed on a separate server.
For the Chat system: for now we should use PiratePad, although other 
options can be investigated in future.

/*Stored articels*/ should be of different kind:

   1. *Descriptive articles* about the community. 
   2. *Scratch pad articles*
   3. Rules and strategic plans about the community
   4. Documents that the community is trying to write together.

Each page should be presented in a way in which it is clear which type 
is it. *Descriptive articles* about the community should generally be in 
a wiki format, and open to anyone to change. The community should make 
sure they represent the general direction of the community, in a general 
loose wiki style.
*Scratch pad articles* should also be in a  loose wiki style, but they 
are representative only of the person writing it.
*Rules and Strategic Plans* should be protected, and generally only 
changeable through (open or closed) Voting.
Documents that the community are writing together, represent a new set 
of pages. We miss at the moment a tool that integrates the creation of a 
document (like a wiki), a comment structure (paragraph by paragraph), a 
voting for each paragraph, and generally an open question structure for 
each paragraph that can represent the different point of views at the 
same time. For now we should use Candiwi, /*Votorola*/, /*...*/ but we 
should develop those tools further.

/*[...]  (deleted, because at least Votorola does support page protection)*/

Note that although there are multiple tools that are going to be used, 
/*they either have a separate function or work in parallel*/. As such 
there /*can ***/be no competition /*for voters*/ between the tools, 
/*but a productive competition for users is still possible.*/

Best,
Thomas
