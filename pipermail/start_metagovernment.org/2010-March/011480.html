<PRE>Owen and Ed,

I agree.  The onus falls on Metagov.

Ed Pastore wrote
&gt;<i> If I recall, the proposal is to create some sort of more formal  
</I>&gt;<i> arrangement between Metagov and Active projects such that each has a  
</I>&gt;<i> defined role in relation to the other.
</I>
Following what Owen suggests, formal arrangements might be the wrong
approach.  You don't want form (per se), you want actual deeds.

&gt;<i> For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Active Projects:
</I>&gt;<i> - display an affiliation blurb or logo on their websites
</I>&gt;<i> - commit to a certain level of participation on the list, wiki, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> - commit to participation in the Standardization project (even if only  
</I>&gt;<i> as a critic or nay-sayer)
</I>&gt;<i> - mention Metagov and other Active projects at conferences or when  
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise given the opportunity
</I>&gt;<i> - pay a small amount of monthly or annual dues (sounds controversial)
</I>
Since the active projects are already oriented to action, I would put
the emphasis here:

&gt;<i> Metagovernment:
</I>&gt;<i> - actively promotes all projects (and the general principles of  
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance) on the web, at conferences, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> - seeks out opportunities to promote specific projects where appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> - encourages each of its individual members to commit some time to at  
</I>&gt;<i> least one active project
</I>&gt;<i> - coordinates the Standardization project
</I>&gt;<i> - seeks out additional forms of cooperation between some or all  
</I>&gt;<i> projects; actively promotes synergy when possible
</I>&gt;<i> - works toward hosting a conference to promote collaborative  
</I>&gt;<i> governance and the active projects
</I>
That might be too ambitious.  You might not have the resources for all
that.  Maybe just pick one task, and try to move it forward.  Aim for
results (as Owen suggests) and see what happens.

I understand you see Metagov working as an adhocracy.  But the whole
world is already an adhocracy, and Metagov's contribution so far is:

  1) A mailing list (one of the best in e-dem)

  2) ... (stay tuned)
