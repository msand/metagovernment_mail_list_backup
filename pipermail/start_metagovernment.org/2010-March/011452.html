<PRE>I am a little hesitant to change the name yet again, but I do agree  
that &quot;collaborative governance&quot; is somewhat too broad. And it is too  
many syllables. :) Also, I just recently told Richard Stallman that we  
finally moved away from the word &quot;open,&quot; much to his delight.

But so far, I do tend to prefer &quot;open governance&quot; to other things  
proposed. If anyone wants to see the history of the Vilfredo  
discussion, it is here:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewhistoryofquestion.php?q=53">http://vilfredo.org/viewhistoryofquestion.php?q=53</A>
Strange that &quot;open governance&quot; wasn't even proposed there...

Does anyone have a better idea? Feel free to either present it here,  
or on Vilfredo:

</I>&gt;<i> I would to like to call the attention for the name of what we're
</I>&gt;<i> promoting. It happens that *collaborative governance* is &quot;a process
</I>&gt;<i> and a form of governance in which participants (parties, agencies,
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders) representing different interests are collectively
</I>&gt;<i> empowered to make a policy decision or make recommendations to a final
</I>&gt;<i> decision-maker who will not substantially change consensus
</I>&gt;<i> recommendations from the group&quot;. This comes from Wikipedia, but it
</I>&gt;<i> also appears that this meaning is present in other places of the
</I>&gt;<i> Internet as well. (Google it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To make things worst, open source governance has *considerably* weight
</I>&gt;<i> in the Internet; one can be tempted to return to that previous name,
</I>&gt;<i> although it's an unfriendly one. Anyway, I feel that we can move
</I>&gt;<i> forward and try to pick a better name. I see two ways we could follow,
</I>&gt;<i> if the group agree:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) To do some bibliographical research among science fiction,
</I>&gt;<i> political science (and the combined genre 'political science fiction')
</I>&gt;<i> books, looking for the first term coined. Recently, while reading, the
</I>&gt;<i> word *computocracy* assaulted me. Should we revive it? There is even a
</I>&gt;<i> 1985 book by Archie J. Bahm with that name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that a term lasting with '-cracy' is a great choice:
</I>&gt;<i> technical and elegant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b) To hear what Internet has to say about this subject, analyzing
</I>&gt;<i> search results. People use several synonyms for open source
</I>&gt;<i> governance, like democracy 2.0, open politics, open governance,
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative democracy, participatory democracy, and so on. The 2.0
</I>&gt;<i> suffix won't help, but the word 'open' tends to appear a lot, also
</I>&gt;<i> 'democracy'. (For some reason open democracy isn't suitable.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like open governance the most, because is simpler than open source
</I>&gt;<i> governance, yet it can be easily related to it. We could convince
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia editors to point open source governance to open governance,
</I>&gt;<i> not otherwise, as actually occurs.
