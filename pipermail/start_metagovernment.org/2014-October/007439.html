<PRE>Hello,

I was thinking...
There are people that want do things global and others that do not.
It seems to be that the non-global version of solving things, will fail 
on aggressive nationalism.
The global version may have power to get over this obstacle.

If we do want to do things globally, we should consider some ideas.
Some places do not have enough computers. Do we need to solve this 
before being global ?

How to prevent Sybil attack ? There is still quite some number of people 
who do not have ID. In real life is it solved by Election ink. How do we 
solve it ?

I think we need to solve these questions. When you do not solve it, I 
tend to see your projects just as utopias or visions and others may too.

I was solving these questions and I have solved them somehow. I felt 
sorry that it did not catch your attention, but maybe I have forgotten 
to tell you about it :D
Anyway here is it.

What do you think ?

     Kind regards
         Michael
