<PRE>It is fair because all a reductionist science does well is to reify.  You
do know of course that you are a sphere of one mole of water moving in a
frictionless fluid?

And the causality model is itself very mechanical.  Kinesthetic?  How many
other causality models are there?  200?

The 5000 people story is a real story and also a outlier except it is
repeatable in that particular circumstance.

You basically argue that we are doing engineering and engineering might
then be the skilled application of scientific results and then say there is
no science just pragmatism.  Okay.  We were able to build steel bridges
that did not fall down with no science.  It took 20 years of trying.  You
invoke science where there is no science as you might understand.  There is
a world out there where you can be asciencism  and still get results.

Anyway putting &quot;set&quot; in quotations confuses me.  We spent 1000 years at
least getting a good definition and what we have is underneath the math
axioms which you might think underlies acience which underlies engineering
which you might think underlies this discussion.

On the end point, which text I did suppress, a good goal might be better
decisions.  So what values of better do you value?

</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking this isn't playing fair: Unless you're going to reject

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Axiom of choice says every collection is a set.  If this applies to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mundane world then every arbitrary collection is not only homogeneous
</I>&gt;<i> but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; includes all the items that are homogeneous, excluding none improperly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In theory: In practice you'll find that a randomly chosen &quot;set&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i> people are pretty much non-homogeneous in their political outlook and
</I>&gt;<i> behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suppose I need to say the axiom does have physical reality.  But the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; matter is a bit complex.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But all the collections you will come across are homogeneous and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understanding and usefulness of this is limited by the computational
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capability of the universe.  Notice that the word in question then become
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meaningless in scientism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As this whole exercise is for the purposes of engineering...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You might want to think about how 5000 people can get together and reach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus by treating that as outside of scientism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, it's in the realm of fantasy or wishful thinking.  Unless maybe
</I>&gt;<i> they're all members of a religious cult or something, in which case
</I>&gt;<i> homogeneity is enforced by cultural norms (as indeed it was in the
</I>&gt;<i> soviets).  My proposal is that we're not cultural engineers, nor
</I>&gt;<i> should we aspire to be: We need to design systems that work with
</I>&gt;<i> people as they come to it, not try to change them to fit the system.
</I>&gt;<i> Which is what I see the consent/consensus aficionados trying to do.
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone is following that debate on the AG list (a German list for
</I>&gt;<i> the Pirate Party) you'll appreciate the irony of how subgroups intent
</I>&gt;<i> on developing consensus-based systems are hoist by their own petard.
