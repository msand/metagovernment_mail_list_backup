<PRE>Scott, what do you actually support ? May I read somewhere about it ? I 
was looking at the entry under your nickname at the wiki, but it is not 
telling me much.
Do you support direct democracy with proxies ? How do you create topics 
and how do you prioritize them ?

Could you compare your ideas with WPE <A HREF="http://www.tgde.org/">http://www.tgde.org/</A> ?

     Regards,
         Michael

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ok, what authoritarians do not want to do in order to get power ?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The ability to have a rational discussion about religion or morals
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be a great filter.  For example I'm working on a moral code
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> section for my book and ran across this page on Richard Dawkins' site:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://richarddawkins.net/2014/07/are-there-emotional-no-go-areas-where-logic-dare-not-show-its-face/">https://richarddawkins.net/2014/07/are-there-emotional-no-go-areas-where-logic-dare-not-show-its-face/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So we would need something like long class in moral philosophy, where we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will ask everybody with pulse over 100 per minute to leave ?
</I>&gt;<i> I like the brain scan idea (as used in my book) better.  You can
</I>&gt;<i> actually see the activation in the amygdala (the emotional center of
</I>&gt;<i> the brain) is more highly activated in authoritarians (usually
</I>&gt;<i> described as &quot;social conservatives&quot; in these studies) in situations
</I>&gt;<i> where a situation calls for making a decision that involves a conflict
</I>&gt;<i> between the rational and emotional modes of operation.  But I only
</I>&gt;<i> prescribe this technique for distinguishing sexual orientation
</I>&gt;<i> (particularly pedophiles) as a condition of their marriage or
</I>&gt;<i> employment, not for trying to exclude authoritarians from voting
</I>&gt;<i> because I consider the latter to be impractical and potentially even
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous WRT social stability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I see your honorable goal of making government easy. On the other hand I see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we cannot consider universe or just the known nature easy. I do not see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how can be doing good decisions in this universe easy.
</I>&gt;<i> I agree my proposal is far from ideal.  But it does have two advantages:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It's way better than the current system because it bypasses the
</I>&gt;<i> whole corruption issue (same with most direct democracy proposals),
</I>&gt;<i> and as a bonus drastically reduces the influence of authoritarians
</I>&gt;<i> (not usually a feature in most direct democracy systems, which tend
</I>&gt;<i> toward your mericracy philosophy which would allow them through the
</I>&gt;<i> filter).
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It's implementable.  Which is important because even if it's only a
</I>&gt;<i> stepping stone on the way to a better system, at least it gets us out
</I>&gt;<i> of the hole we're currently in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The idea of outvoting seems to be easiest for this purpose. If I would like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to arrange something like that I would select random people (for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effectiveness), test them as socially acceptable and finally let them vote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with Condorcet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think ?
</I>&gt;<i> This is actually discussed in my book.  It's a proposal that's been
</I>&gt;<i> rattling around political science for decades (I remember a poly sci
</I>&gt;<i> prof of mine seriously recommending this back in 1980 or so).  The big
</I>&gt;<i> problem is that it's impractical to get a truly random sample because
</I>&gt;<i> of self selection biases, i.e., authoritarians will put their names on
</I>&gt;<i> the list and then volunteer to serve when called, whereas
</I>&gt;<i> neurotypicals will avoid both.  It'll be like jury duty, where anyone
</I>&gt;<i> with half a brain can get out of serving with a few well chosen words.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, I was called a few months ago for a multi-day drug trial,
</I>&gt;<i> and when I answered the question about what I do in my spare time I
</I>&gt;<i> gave an outline of the book I'm working on and was instantly excused
</I>&gt;<i> for cause by the judge.  I actually expected to make it through the
</I>&gt;<i> first round and then be excluded by the prosecutor (I also have a PhD,
</I>&gt;<i> which is something prosecutors try to avoid because apparently we tend
</I>&gt;<i> to cause hung juries), but it didn't even come to that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second problem is the relatively poor level of education of our
</I>&gt;<i> populations, particularly WRT probability and statistics, lack of
</I>&gt;<i> awareness of our instinctive miscalibration when it comes to
</I>&gt;<i> low-probability events, and our blindness of our tendencies towards
</I>&gt;<i> superstition and conspiracy theories.  IMHO even though a truly random
</I>&gt;<i> sampling system (like Blinap) is far superior to any mass-voting
</I>&gt;<i> system both in terms of efficiency and in terms of inherent bias, The
</I>&gt;<i> People I think won't be ready for such a system until they become much
</I>&gt;<i> better educated and have considerable hands-on experience with
</I>&gt;<i> automated voting and budgeting systems.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
