Scaling won&#8217;t be an issue. We will be so connected and empowered technologically that coming to decisions in large groups will be relatively simple and routine.

The Corporate model will be taken over by the Cooperative model. The Cooperative model will run on a continually evolving platform/network/program/intelligence for managing the mission of our self-organization. The mission is *All for All*.  This will be (is being) driven by the same shift in consciousness that bring all of us to this list&#8230;.and will be built on the bits and pieces now developing among us.
