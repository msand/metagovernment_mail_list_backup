<PRE>On Fri, Oct 10, 2014 at 6:40 PM, Reid Millerd &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">mrpdublin at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> I also agree with your statement that we need to design the system around

</I>
This is may be overstating the problem a little.  There is a *small*
amount of outright altruistic behavior available, and more importantly
we have an instinctive sense of &quot;fair play&quot; that allows us to support
(fund) projects that we don't directly benefit from so long as we have
benefited from some other project that we see that others have not
benefited from.  E.g., if some of the generally-collected tax money is
used for upgrades to a subway system in the city, the people in that
city are far more likely to agree to spend money on rural roads that
they may never use.

But I agree that assuming selfish behavior is a good first
approximation and that any system that relies on more than a modicum
of altruism or quid pro quo is destined to fail.

&gt;<i> However I believe that this is where active discussion can come in to
</I>&gt;<i> resolve any issue. Before anything goes to a vote it is first put through a
</I>&gt;<i> debate forum, where the individual presents the idea that they think has the
</I>&gt;<i> best chance of being passed. They pander to the room, rationalizing why the
</I>&gt;<i> rest of the population should support their idea, giving incentive for
</I>&gt;<i> others to get on board. In this way the temperature of the room is taken and
</I>&gt;<i> we get a sense of how the public feels about the proposal before it goes to
</I>&gt;<i> a vote. This gives a chance for opposing views to voice their opinions as to
</I>&gt;<i> why they are against the idea, suggestions as to how they might gain support
</I>&gt;<i> for the idea can be presented and incorporated into the proposal.
</I>
Besides the obvious benefits of fleshing out the proposal and
exploring all the options, this system could provide an extremely
valuable resource for the general vote: A complete ranked list of all
the pro/con arguments for the proposal that the general population can
use to inform their vote in the final phase.  The voters may only read
2 or 3 posts in each category, but those will be the 2 or 3 posts that
all the previous participants have judged to be the best summaries of
the relevant arguments.  This leverages our instinctive skill at
judging expertise in a domain even when we have very little of it
ourselves.

&gt;<i> Using the road example again. The corn farmer says he wants new roads to
</I>&gt;<i> help him do business with the city more effectively, he does his research
</I>&gt;<i> and says new roads will save so many gallons of petrol per year and reduce
</I>&gt;<i> the amount of wear on vehicles that cost so many dollars to repair every
</I>&gt;<i> year. He budgets the money that this will save him at $2000 annually. Most
</I>&gt;<i> people say fine but what's in it for them? The corn farmer can then come in
</I>&gt;<i> and say &quot;if the project goes through he'll be able to cut 5 cents off every
</I>&gt;<i> dozen ears of corn he sells, bringing the price to $8.35 a dozen&quot;. This
</I>&gt;<i> provides a meaningful incentive for people to support the project, they get
</I>&gt;<i> something out of it. It's important to have these long nuanced conversations
</I>&gt;<i> to fully explore each idea and get everyone's opinions out in the open, then
</I>&gt;<i> we can work on compromises. Once everyone's had their say, all valid
</I>&gt;<i> criticism has been addressed and there isn't any significant opposition to
</I>&gt;<i> the idea, then it goes to a vote.
</I>
You lost me here: My claim is that there will *always* be significant
opposition to any proposal that is strong enough to be effective.  The
goal must be not to suppress (or otherwise eliminate) this opposition,
but to ensure that it is presented as well as possible so that the
final vote will fully account for it.  Even if that final vote comes
out 51 to 49%, as long as a sufficient number of votes have been cast,
the resulting law/policy will be moral and therefore enforceable.  It
is also vastly more likely to be an effective law because it obviously
hasn't been watered down just to make it palatable to some minority.

&gt;<i> Everything is connected in one way or another and if the dots are able to be
</I>&gt;<i> connected in a way that people realize that a project does in fact have
</I>&gt;<i> benefits for them as well, they'll support it, or at least not oppose it.
</I>&gt;<i> Again, the annual budget has to be spent on something. At each level every
</I>&gt;<i> project is only allowed to be a certain amount of the total annual budget,
</I>&gt;<i> this ensures that many projects are passed throughout the year and that only
</I>&gt;<i> the most logical ones that are proven to support the largest amount of
</I>&gt;<i> population go through.
</I>
Budgeting I think is a separate issue, and I plan to actually have a
separate system to do it.  Unlike law/policy issues, budgeting is
inherently a rank-ordering process, with those projects that fall
below a certain threshold either having their funding cut or
eliminated entirely.

&gt;<i> If there's even a small benefit that people can rationalize with no negative
</I>&gt;<i> consequences then they shouldn't have a problem supporting it right?
</I>
No, but unfortunately this is a theoretical situation that won't often
happen in real life ;-)

&gt;<i> I think it's important to encourage co-operation where ever possible, to try
</I>&gt;<i> and get over this idea that it's us versus them. I believe this system helps
</I>&gt;<i> bridge the gaps and bring people together in a meaningful way. Looking
</I>&gt;<i> forward to your response.
</I>
I agree with the sentiment, and this is why I oppose party-based
systems where one's votes is determined not by the issues themselves
but rather the party lines.  And proposal developers should always
strive to have the highest majorities they can, if only because
counting on winning 51/49 is a pretty risky plan.  But there *should*
be opposition to any important issue, and there must always be winners
and losers because this competition is what leads to improvement
overall.
  Regards,
    Scott
