<PRE>Hello all, this seems to be a concern for a few of us of how to properly
manage distribution at a larger scale operation. Sorry for the lack of
proper terminology in this piece. Also the numbers used are probably all
wrong but the concept I think is sound. I invented a system of taxation
that should work for this global governance project. Please correct any
problems I overlooked.


I'll start off by making a few presumptions, this is to introduce the idea
in a global scale mindset. Everyone is plugged into a global system of
governance, everyone's residence, annual income, everything is documented.
Everyone has an equal say in which laws, projects etc. get passed by way of
online forum or some mode of decision making process.


For simplicity sake, everyone has a flat tax in the world. 20% of
everyone's annual earnings go towards the governing body to be used for
public projects big and small, from installing a new bench in a public park
to sending a spaceship to mars. All the money comes from the 20% of
humanities annual earnings.


Now, every individual is part of one group at every level. I've label each
group for simplicity but each group is defined by the numbers more then the
title, municipal (700 thousand people), state (15 million people), federal
(300 million people), global (7 billion people). The group that a
particular individual is involved in exists within the boundaries of every
individual, so your municipality would simply be the closest 700 thousand
people to your specific residence in the world.


Every year the budget is set based on the collected tax, the taxes are
distributed between the groups (a federal group would have a higher budget
then a municipal group because more people are contributing to it), every
group receives the same budget ( e.g. every municipality has a 30 million
dollar budget, every state has 2 billion, etc.), every individual is able
to see the budget in each of their groups and witness it become diminished
over the year as funds get diverted to projects passed by the people.


So, an individual has a project they'd like to do through the use of tax
dollars. They pick their point on the map where the project is to be
constructed/implemented, then depending on which level they want to funds
to come from (might choose a larger group like federal if the project is
larger in scale) the project is opened up to the closest number of people
in proximity to the project for discussion and voting.


E.g. Somebody wants to use 2 million dollars of the municipal budget to
construct a new gym for a high school, they appeal at the municipal level
to fund the project, the closest 700 thousand people to the actual gym then
get to debate the idea and vote on whether to grant the funds to complete
the project. If the idea passes then 2 million is taken out of the budget
for those 700 thousand people regardless of whether they voted for it or
not. Then another guy proposes another project on the other side of town
that includes some of the people that voted on the gym project as well (it
will not include all of them, just the ones that are within the proximity
of both projects) this project passes as well and more funds are taken out
of budget of the affected individuals. Once the budget is used up it can no
longer fund projects within the area, it must appeal to a larger group or
wait for next year.


This is the gist of it, I can go into more detail but I just wanted to
introduce the idea and see what you guys thought of it.  There is proper
distribution of resources that get to be spent by the immediate community.
It also includes a form of checks and balance approach with the larger
groups being able to veto any project that might affect them as well. This
model destroys the notion of set borders, it morphs for every project to
include the most immediately affected people.


Cheers.
