<PRE>Thank you for your comment,Scott,

there is no need to be crazy about the name, it is just my humour.

ok, what authoritarians do not want to do in order to get power ?

Regards
Michael

</I>&gt;<i> current representative governments (i.e., our systems fail not because
</I>&gt;<i> the representatives are unskilled or uneducated, it's because they're
</I>&gt;<i> easily corruptible and the system is designed in such a way to allow

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking of which, as part of my utopias/dystopias survey I recently
</I>&gt;<i> finished HG Wells' &quot;A Modern Utopia&quot;.  The leaders in that system are
</I>&gt;<i> called &quot;Samurai&quot; and they are self-selected: Nobody votes them into
</I>&gt;<i> (or out of) office, they just have to follow &quot;The Rule&quot; to demonstrate
</I>&gt;<i> that they're qualified.  &quot;The Rule&quot; being a very odd set of criteria
</I>&gt;<i> including being required to take cold showers, wear special clothes,
</I>&gt;<i> be teetotalers, and avoid any occupation that involves buying or
</I>&gt;<i> selling things.  It wasn't exactly clear to me what any of these
</I>&gt;<i> things had to do with being good at government, and worse, these are
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the kind of arbitrary rules that Authoritarians would be happy
</I>&gt;<i> to follow but the neurotypicals would not (i.e., it's exactly the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite of what *I* claim is the way to ensure good government).  It
</I>&gt;<i> also didn't seem very &quot;Utopian&quot; to me: There are no pets, there seemed
</I>&gt;<i> to be very few fun things to do, and the jail system sounded just like
</I>&gt;<i> the one in the movie &quot;Escape from New York&quot;.  Now I'm on to &quot;Looking
</I>&gt;<i> Backward&quot; which so far seems to be more entertaining but even worse
</I>&gt;<i> WRT gaining any useful ideas for how to structure a government in
</I>&gt;<i> Utopia...
