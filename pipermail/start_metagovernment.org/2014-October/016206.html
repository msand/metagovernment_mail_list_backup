</I>So we would need something like long class in moral philosophy, where we 
will ask everybody with pulse over 100 per minute to leave ?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I'd say the odds of being able to impose a system that filters
</I>&gt;<i> like this (including your mericracy example) are very low because
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarians and social dominators wouldn't stand for it. And
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately those are exactly the kinds of people you don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> screw with because they will have no qualms about establishing a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Fourth Reich&quot; via violent overthrow of the government if they're
</I>&gt;<i> pushed.  Which is why my proposal is to drown them in Neurotypical
</I>&gt;<i> input instead: They are a minority after all and it's fair game to
</I>&gt;<i> override their prejudice with the will of the moderate majority of the
</I>&gt;<i> population, at least as long as you're willing to concede that
</I>&gt;<i> consensus is not a viable decision rule.  The only trick there is
</I>&gt;<i> making the system easy (i.e., efficient) enough that they can run the
</I>&gt;<i> government with a modest investment of time (my target is an hour a
</I>&gt;<i> week).
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>I see your honorable goal of making government easy. On the other hand I 
see that we cannot consider universe or just the known nature easy. I do 
not see how can be doing good decisions in this universe easy.

The idea of outvoting seems to be easiest for this purpose. If I would 
like to arrange something like that I would select random people (for 
effectiveness), test them as socially acceptable and finally let them 
vote with Condorcet.
What do you think ?

         Michael
