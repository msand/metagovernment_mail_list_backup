&gt;&gt;<i> I recommend you read my Plan (current draft of which is always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available as <A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf">http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf</A>) for some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> counterarguments.  There are a lot of problems with income-based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> taxation system (e.g., large numbers of people, especially independent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contractors and those in the underground economy, simply cheat).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have people that cheat the tax system now, we go after them and get them
</I>&gt;<i> to pay. Same problem no?
</I>
Not at all, unfortunately: Income is *much* harder to track than sales
by companies.  Income is earned by individuals, many of whom are self
employed or operating in the underground economy and so there is no
way to accurately track all their activity.  Products, on the other
and, are physical objects and there are any number of ways to track
them, most especially because nearly all of them are produced by
companies who must have fairly rigorous accounting systems or they
will fail.  Corporate income tax is particularly problematic because
it requires so many loopholes (writeoffs/depreciation) to support
investment that in many cases these companies currently spend more on
lawyers and accountants to *avoid* paying taxes as they would under a
sales tax system with *no* deductions, so switching would provide vast
efficiencies.

&gt;<i> Everything's going digital, we might not have the
</I>&gt;<i> paper money to pass around, going to be harder to rationalize. This
</I>&gt;<i> simplifies the tax code, people need to prove how they're coming across
</I>&gt;<i> money to support themselves.
</I>
I'm pretty resistant to &quot;we have enough laws, we just need to enforce
the one's we already have&quot; arguments.  Again, if people believe a law
is immoral enforcement becomes impractical, and there are just a lot
more people who have a problem with income taxes than those with
problems with sales/consumption taxes.  In which case the proper
course of action is to revise the law, not spend a whole lot of money
making a whole lot of people miserable trying to enforce a bad one.
One of the benefits of a direct democracy is that revisiting these bad
laws will be a *lot* more straightforward as will be the process of
gauging the morality of a proposed law because the affected people
will be directly involved in designing it.

&gt;&gt;<i> Not a progressive tax?  The conservatives and one-percenters will love
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this.  Everyone else, not so much...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My proposal is for a variable sales/consumption tax.  Much more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efficient to manage, much less cheating and other gaming of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system, and at least partially progressive as a starting point.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beef up the progressive nature by eliminating inheritance, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> according to Piketty's data about 50% of all capital flows through at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yours might very well be the better system, I haven't done extensive
</I>&gt;<i> research in the area. But for now I prefer my model because it's simpler,
</I>&gt;<i> easier to manage and its fairer.
</I>
I think not, at least according to popular opinion: At lower income
levels spending flattens out so this group ends of paying a far higher
percentage of their income on taxes on essentials and no-one considers
that fair.  There are a few tweaks available here including rebates or
eliminating taxes on certain items, but that sacrifices efficiency for
fairness.

&gt;<i> You earn your money you should be entitled
</I>&gt;<i> to use it, not get it taken away because you're good at getting money. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> with you on the inheritance thing, but let a guy spend his money if he's
</I>&gt;<i> earned it.
</I>
But that's exactly what an income tax works against, and why people
resist them (and cheat on them).  I recommend learning about the flat
tax (<A HREF="http://www.savingthedream.org/">http://www.savingthedream.org/</A>) and the fair tax
(<A HREF="http://www.fairtax.org/">http://www.fairtax.org/</A>).  They both do a good job of describing the
problem and good arguments for replacing income tax with sales taxes.
Just keep in mind that both have serious problems compared with my
proposal (a variable sales tax rate, which is only possible in a
direct democracy because there are no representatives to bribe to set
the tax rate on your product lower than it should be), especially in
their handling of housing and other real estate.

&gt;&gt;<i> Again, I recommend my Locality system over this: People need to group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> according to needs and it's not reasonable to put rural residents in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with their nearest city because their needs are different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Their needs may be different but does that mean they're not able to
</I>&gt;<i> sympathies with one another? If a project helps a rural residence, are we
</I>&gt;<i> unable to realize that we are all interconnected and that we function better
</I>&gt;<i> together if we don't fight each other? What's good for the goose is good for
</I>&gt;<i> the gander. Multiple needs can be addressed at once, it's not a one or the
</I>&gt;<i> other scenario. This system will help us realize that we're all in this
</I>&gt;<i> together. Remove the borders and suddenly we're all just people.
</I>
Again, a little handwaving doesn't get rid of instinctive behavior
that has been evolved into us over millions of years.  One of my
&quot;deprecated instincts&quot; is exactly this kind of land-based tribalism,
but I'm not so naive to propose that declaring it so is instantly
going to make it so.  Anyone who's lived in an area where rural and
urban areas overlap can tell you that the different priorities and
requirements is a *constant* source of friction.  It's just more
efficient social engineering to incorporate this fact into the design
of our new system rather than require that we try to change people in
an attempt to eliminate it.

&gt;&gt;<i> Good idea, and this is level of transparency is something seriously
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lacking in all of our current systems.  But I think you need to tie
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the distribution to the income from an area: Some will contribute less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply because their cost of living (and/or standard of living) are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lower than other places.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes some people will contribute less, some will contribute more, 20%. These
</I>&gt;<i> areas that are poor get the same amount as every other municipality though,
</I>&gt;<i> this ensures we all get the opportunity to grow together. No one gets
</I>&gt;<i> special treatment. It's fair. What's wrong with that?
</I>
The cost of living in rural Africa is about 1% of what it is in New
York City, even assuming the same standard of living (which again is
not necessary and not even expected).  Taxing and reimbursing them all
the same will have those African living like kings while contributing
a negligible amount to the quality of life of the New Yorkers.  Maybe
a few centuries from now living conditions will have homogenized
enough to allow this, but for now it's a non-starter.

&gt;&gt;<i> I like the elegance of the floating boundaries, but fear you've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> glossed over the differences among the needs of people in these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relatively larger categories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, many needs are able to be met at once, I think we're capable of
</I>&gt;<i> realizing that we're all in this together,  it's better if we work in
</I>&gt;<i> conjunction which each other instead of opposed.
</I>
I call handwaving again: Relying on people's better natures to achieve
something like this just fails.  You have to assume that people have a
very limited capacity for this kind of altruism. As I point out in my
book, if the people in LV and LA have a billion dollars to spend, of
course it would be more fair (in a utilitarian sense) for them to
spend most of it providing safe drinking water for people in rural
Africa.  But what they want (and what they'll insist on) is spending
it on a high-speed rail system between those two cities.
Understanding this and creating a system where at least *some* of the
money is diverted to Africa (enough to make a difference, not enough
to make the Locality feel that they're being taken advantage of) is
the difference between utilitarian philosophy and social engineering.
