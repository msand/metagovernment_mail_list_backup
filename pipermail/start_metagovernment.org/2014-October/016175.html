<PRE>I &quot;show you&quot; my way,is called Airesis 3.0 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.airesis.eu">http://www.airesis.eu</A>&gt;, I
disagree that must b e a single programmer but a group of analyst should
make the analysis  and a group of programmer do the work. Unfortunately
Airesis is developed in Ruby and the language barrier is there.
Regarding the interoperability I already explained in another thread.
Our head programmer say that the learning curve between Java and Ruby is
low so please give it a try
For the virtual world i partially agree about the testing but is already so
complicated to run a full run of test, we use
testrail and I invite everyone to give it a look the platform is there to
play with and report every bug you discover with the ? and ! menu.
The method I suggest to use to change the governance is easy every time the
congress debate a subjet, the subject matter should be immediately opened
on the platform and then let the community goes in to the proposals and the
votation process.  at that time we show the decision and we see the
discrepancy between the people decision and then let's see!!
Peace

</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; point that the two or more decision systems have produced their parallel

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; remain untested, so that comparing the quality of decision outputs will
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; impossible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Depends on how you measure &quot;quality&quot;: For example, if our new People's
</I>&gt;<i> Congress decides not to spend 2 trillion dollars on a new nuclear
</I>&gt;<i> submarine fleet (as our &quot;real&quot; congress has), we don't really need a
</I>&gt;<i> virtual world simulation that shows conclusively how many shipbuilding
</I>&gt;<i> jobs won't happen or how much our taxes will go down.  Merely being
</I>&gt;<i> able to conclusively state that cancelling that project represents the
</I>&gt;<i> Will of The People is all the &quot;quality&quot; we need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; Scientists do research in laboratories for good reason. The real
</I>&gt;<i> world
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is exceedingly messy; extraneous factors abound. We can learn better and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; faster through experiments run in controlled environments, and through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; experiments that can be run to completion in parallel to allow
</I>&gt;<i> comparison
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; among results. Implementing parallel decisions on parallel virtual
</I>&gt;<i> worlds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; would enable this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.  But it may simply be a luxury (or perhaps a marketing tool)
</I>&gt;<i> we can't afford.  To some extent we have to rely on faith that a
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy is superior to a representative democracy and act
</I>&gt;<i> (and convince other people to act) accordingly.  The economic
</I>&gt;<i> simulations I propose in The Plan I think are much less ambitious than
</I>&gt;<i> what you are proposing.  We'll be able to determine whether or not
</I>&gt;<i> people can game the system with only a few dozen participants in a
</I>&gt;<i> very primitive virtual world (I'm thinking something along the lines
</I>&gt;<i> of the first generation of Sim City or Warcraft).  The primary reason
</I>&gt;<i> for doing more would be to use that data for marketing.  But I'm
</I>&gt;<i> inclined to think we'll be a lot more successful marketing the new
</I>&gt;<i> system as a religion than marketing it the way you would paper towels
</I>&gt;<i> (independent research shows that it's 50% less corrupt than ordinary
</I>&gt;<i> governments!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;Scott&gt; I would assume adoption of the new system would be from small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; (HOAs, school boards, etc.) to large, but even this is not necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> My
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; belief is we could set up a system that would provide better results
</I>&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; the US congress relatively easily, for example ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; You would be able to show that your alternative decision system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; produced different decisions, but you would not be able to show that
</I>&gt;<i> those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; different decisions produced &quot;better&quot; results. For that, you would need
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; implement each decision in its own parallel virtual world, and then
</I>&gt;<i> measure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and compare the results produced by the decisions. (And also, Congress
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;Scott's The System&quot; are not the only two dogs in the race -- you keep
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; forgetting that. Your main competition is not Congress.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, obviously the main competition is skepticism and apathy.  But,
</I>&gt;<i> again, I think you're setting the bar too high: We don't have to have
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;best buy&quot; rating from Consumer Reports to be successful, everyone
</I>&gt;<i> knows the existing systems have serious problems, all we need to do is
</I>&gt;<i> provide a legitimate alternative and market it properly to win.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; I take your parsing of the problem domain to be one of the problems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; *in* that problem domain. You seem to think that &quot;government&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decision-matters are cleanly distinguishable from &quot;economic&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decision-matters, from &quot;environmental&quot; decision-matters, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> Really?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If you do think that, please explain the distinguishing principles to
</I>&gt;<i> me. (I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; would have thought that substantive &quot;government&quot; decisions inevitably
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; economic and environmental effects, and that it is precisely through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; comparing those effects that we will be able to select/synthesize our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;better than Congress&quot; decision system.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're right, of course.  Theoretically.  Then again, I still believe
</I>&gt;<i> that Marx was right, theoretically.  Turns out he didn't understand
</I>&gt;<i> human nature, which turns out to be necessary out in the real world.
</I>&gt;<i> Changing both our political and economic systems at the same time IMHO
</I>&gt;<i> is just one of those things that people won't be willing to do.
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately we can fix the majority of the problems we face, and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> almost all of them, by merely fixing the political system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; (And also, &quot;metagovernment&quot; means &quot;more than just government&quot;, just
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;metaphysics&quot; means &quot;more than just physics&quot;. It means examining and
</I>&gt;<i> dealing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with the larger/deeper context in which the field is embedded. You want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;metagovernment.org&quot; to be just &quot;government.org&quot;. But perpetuating such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;silo thinking&quot; is (I suggest) precisely what we do not need at this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; juncture of human history.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't propose to exclude economic systems from the list of
</I>&gt;<i> subjects we can discuss here.  I'm just saying that my position in the
</I>&gt;<i> debate is that this group has enough on its plate without that....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; You (correctly) see that &quot;economic decisions&quot; produce effects when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; implemented, and that we need to determine and compare those effects in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; order to make informed choices among alternative economic systems.
</I>&gt;<i> Oddly,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you apparently do not see that &quot;government decisions&quot; also produce
</I>&gt;<i> effects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; when implemented, and that we need to determine and compare those
</I>&gt;<i> effects in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; order to make informed choices among alternative governance systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, it's not that I don't *see* it, it's just than I'm an engineer
</I>&gt;<i> by nature and so I'd rather get an imperfect or incomplete system
</I>&gt;<i> actually implemented than design a perfect one that only exists in
</I>&gt;<i> theory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;Scott&gt; This is *not* the purpose of metagovernment.org. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;metaeconomics.org&quot; or &quot;metacapitalism.org&quot; or something ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; Here again is what appears to me to be &quot;silo thinking&quot;. To try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; punch holes in those silos (to release those trapped), I will say this:
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; term &quot;democratic capitalism&quot; is internally contradictory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; Each and every time that a capitalist or a corporation makes a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; public-matter decision (that is, a decision that will affect not just
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; capitalist or corporation), democracy has been usurped. From the
</I>&gt;<i> perspective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of public-matter decision making, democracy and capitalism are mutually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; exclusive alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I agree with you *in theory*.  But as a practical matter my
</I>&gt;<i> inclination is that the two are compatible enough that we don't have
</I>&gt;<i> to change both systems at the same time, especially when changing just
</I>&gt;<i> the political system fixes most of the problems we face with the
</I>&gt;<i> economic system (it being used to game the political system being by
</I>&gt;<i> far the biggest of these, with inequality being a distant second, and
</I>&gt;<i> all the other problems (inefficiency, negative impacts on morale,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) being almost negligible).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; Moreover (warm fuzzy fairy tales aside), the most successful actual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; capitalists are generally strongly opposed to democratic influences, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; will do what they can to neutralize and override such influences,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; particularly with respect to their own plans and interests. (I wonder
</I>&gt;<i> if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; most successful capitalists are typically SDAs ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, they definitely are.  As are the best military personnel, and
</I>&gt;<i> possibly even the best bureaucrats.  This isn't a problem, though, and
</I>&gt;<i> may even be an advantage because it enables them to perform those
</I>&gt;<i> roles better than neurotypicals: It's restricting SDA influence on the
</I>&gt;<i> *political* system that has to be our major concern because that's
</I>&gt;<i> where their prejudice and irrationality are causing the most serious
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; Bottom Line: Continuing to trust &quot;The Invisible Hand&quot; to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; public-matter decisions will very likely produce the result that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; biosphere will be rendered unsuitable for human habitation. (But what
</I>&gt;<i> do we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; care -- we are not environmentalists, we are only concerned with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; government.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong, I'm an environmentalist too, but IMHO the solution
</I>&gt;<i> to a degrading environment isn't the government (as it exists) and
</I>&gt;<i> especially isn't the economic system.  It's primarily a religious
</I>&gt;<i> issue: The People have to *believe* that dealing it with is the right
</I>&gt;<i> thing to do.  Once that is in place, it pretty much doesn't matter
</I>&gt;<i> which government or economic system you have in place as the necessary
</I>&gt;<i> changes will be made.  But this is why it's not something I think it's
</I>&gt;<i> necessary or productive to discuss here even though allowance for it
</I>&gt;<i> should be part of all of our system designs: Metagovernment for me is
</I>&gt;<i> not a religious or marketing organization and so I'd prefer to
</I>&gt;<i> concentrate on more nuts-and-bolts kinds of things here.
