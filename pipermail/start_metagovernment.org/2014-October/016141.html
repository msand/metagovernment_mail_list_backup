<PRE>Hi Pietro,

To me, the applicable saying is not &quot;the perfect is an enemy of the 
good&quot; but rather &quot;the useless is an enemy of the useful&quot;.

My thought is that the function of a brief vision statement is to serve 
as an &quot;elevator pitch&quot; for the actual backing vision. (The purpose of 
the backing vision is to guide and motivate action.) If there is no 
actual backing vision, then the brief vision statement serves as &quot;a 
bridge to nowhere&quot; -- it is useless.

We already have a brief vision statement that is a kind of temporary 
statement (and useless). What purpose would it serve to generate another 
one? Unless/until we have a backing vision, any brief vision statement 
that we come up with will be nothing but a temporary place-filling stub.

What does &quot;good enough for now&quot; mean to you in this instance? Good 
enough for what? What do you view the purpose of a temporary brief 
vision statement to be? (And how do we measure whether a particular 
brief vision statement is or is not adequately serving that purpose?)

(You have said that you will support my choice (appreciated!), and I now 
say that I will support your choice. So, I guess I am asking for a peek 
at the backing vision you have in mind regarding the &quot;produce another 
temporary brief vision statement&quot; project that you are suggesting.)

I agree with you that there is nothing dangerous about using Vilfredo or 
some other tool to come up with another temporary brief vision statement 
to replace the one that is on the Mission/Vision Page now. Certainly 
that project is &quot;safe enough to try&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Pietro (Good Question!),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Your question has led me to notice that indeed I was not clear.
</I>&gt;<i>     (That happens when I hurry ...) So now I will start over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I see a community Vision quest as potentially a very worthwhile
</I>&gt;<i>     project. The question then becomes, how to proceed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     We could start by hammering out a single vision statement through
</I>&gt;<i>     Vilfredo, as we did the Home Page text. But, in order for a brief
</I>&gt;<i>     vision statement to actually mean anything useful, it must be
</I>&gt;<i>     backed by an actual vision of something. If the something is a
</I>&gt;<i>     social system or social sub-system, it is going to be a very
</I>&gt;<i>     complex thingy, with myriad moving parts all interconnected and
</I>&gt;<i>     interacting. (Just a brief overview description of Scott's
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;ThePlan&quot; is 85 pages long. The brief overview description of
</I>&gt;<i>     Isonomea that was on wiser.org &lt;<A HREF="http://wiser.org">http://wiser.org</A>&gt; had 160 pages.
</I>&gt;<i>     The Votorola material is similarly lengthy, as are some of the
</I>&gt;<i>     Sociocracy texts.) Vilfredo cannot handle such lengthy and complex
</I>&gt;<i>     proposals.(Yes?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My thought is that we need to have already reached a common vision
</I>&gt;<i>     in order for it to be worthwhile for us to try to produce a brief
</I>&gt;<i>     vision statement backed by that common vision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So then the question becomes, how might we best begin the project
</I>&gt;<i>     of reaching a common vision?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My (here proposed) answer to this question is that it might be
</I>&gt;<i>     good to start by proposing fundamental &quot;filter principles&quot;, that
</I>&gt;<i>     any proposed vision must be in accord with (in order to be
</I>&gt;<i>     considered as a candidate). Coming up with a list of such
</I>&gt;<i>     filter-principles to use in vetting candidate visions would be
</I>&gt;<i>     very metagovernmenty work, and if done well would produce a list
</I>&gt;<i>     that would potentially have lasting and general usefulness. (Scott
</I>&gt;<i>     will want to have &quot;effective&quot; and &quot;efficient&quot; and maybe
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;Paleolithic&quot; on that list.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Once we have the list of filter-principles in hand, we would then
</I>&gt;<i>     have a very powerful tool to apply in trying to select/synthesize
</I>&gt;<i>     a common vision. Once we had a settled vision, we would then be
</I>&gt;<i>     ready to hammer out a brief vision statement backed by that vision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The foregoing is (now) my proposed plan for executing &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i>     Metagovernment Vision Project&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The right way to use Vilfredo at the beginning of this plan (if
</I>&gt;<i>     Vilfredo is to be our tool) would be to propose each individual
</I>&gt;<i>     filter-principle separately to Vilfredo. Then the list of
</I>&gt;<i>     filter-principles would be populated by the winning result of each
</I>&gt;<i>     Vilfredo thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In the interest of grounding this discussion with an example: were
</I>&gt;<i>     we to decide to undertake &quot;The Metagovernment Vision Project&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i>     to execute the plan here proposed, and to use Vilfredo as our
</I>&gt;<i>     synthesis/decision tool, my first filter-principle proposal (to
</I>&gt;<i>     Vilfredo) would be THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         To be acceptable, a candidate vision (social system or
</I>&gt;<i>         sub-system) must be explicitly, intentionally designed to
</I>&gt;<i>         eliminate Power Over Other People in every way possible. By
</I>&gt;<i>         design, there must be no concentrations of power entailed,
</I>&gt;<i>         caused, or permitted within or by the envisioned social
</I>&gt;<i>         (sub-)system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         The reason for this is simple. It does not matter through what
</I>&gt;<i>         means power is initially concentrated (through political,
</I>&gt;<i>         criminal, police, military, economic, financial, religious, or
</I>&gt;<i>         whatever other means) -- the end result will always be the
</I>&gt;<i>         same because power is fungible: any form of concentrated power
</I>&gt;<i>         can be used to acquire more power of any kind. As soon as
</I>&gt;<i>         there is any concentration of power of any kind produced by
</I>&gt;<i>         any social sub-system, the overall social system will commence
</I>&gt;<i>         to morph toward further concentration of power: the existence
</I>&gt;<i>         of concentrations of power sets up positive feedback loops
</I>&gt;<i>         that lead to further concentration of power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (Given that Vilfredo always wants to start with a question, I
</I>&gt;<i>     guess we would have to play Jeopardy to come up with a question to
</I>&gt;<i>     which this proposal would appropriately respond ...)
