<PRE>Here i am coming from a view point that voting is not as important as
useful discussions on a decision.  More idiots talking is not improvement
and more anger leads only to desire but not to understanding or love that
gives hope.  In spiritual structures love is the big item but see David
deutsch.  And in others hope is the big item which tends around Christian
flocks.  And expectation is big around say theosophy in the Erickson thread.

Between anger and idiots everyone gets punched in the nose and more anger
gets gened and no understanding.  I tend to think of using the NSA dataset
(very expensive to access) to translate between the value structures in a
way that avoids the nose punches via a kind of censorship.  Sometimes I am
a nice guy and so I think of an interactive conversation between the
submitter and the dataset until both the dataset and the submitter reach an
agreement.

This whole thing might censor Slashdot sexual humor which  humor would
please most anyone who likes Burma shave signs as well as the very nasty
stuff there.

A complex moderation system based simply on style issues and human
discussion on the style could be a hurdle to general publication and cheap
but we know the control of that barrier will become a strategic goal.

Here we have a sweet story about siri (?) Training a human and it makes me
want to date her.  (I live in mom's basement [ which is a Slashdot meme and
obligatory here]).
