Umm, I'm thinking this is what democracy *is*, or at least should be.
Choosing to not call that thing &quot;government&quot; is just perpetuating the
misconception that &quot;the government&quot; is somehow something different
from &quot;us&quot;.  The problems with our governments not looking/working like
that is our own damn fault, not the fault of &quot;the government&quot; or &quot;the
corporations&quot; or even &quot;the authoritarians&quot;.  Which I guess means I'd
like to correct my previous statement: There is a religious purpose
for Metagovernment and that is to instill faith in people that we can
just create a new system and then switch over to using it whenever we
think it's ready.  Their time and energy (and money) would be much
better spent helping us than in grousing about our current systems or
trying to fix them (or game them).

    Scott
