&gt;<i> Hmm.  &quot;near&quot;implies a metric.  Scalar klicks puts the ISS staff in my

that change as they move around &gt; in whatever space you want to think
about.


Satellite images and computer programming could take care of this problem
much easier than yardsticks.


&gt;<i> Also I assure you rural West power structures generally hate the urban
</I>centers.  Even 50 miles away.  Figure we have to work hard to avoid
manifesting that relationship.


Well the rural wouldn't really be able to influence the city to much
because they would have much lower numbers. Conversely say a farmer wanted
a new road to help him do business. I don't see the city particularly
having a problem with it, because it's not a giant project. Hopefully
people would recognize the connection between the farm and getting food in
the city and want to help this process. There's not much benefit to voting
against it, it's not like your getting extra money if you vote no, the
project money will just be spent else where.


&gt;<i>By the way my municipality has about 800 people.  My county a bit more
</I>than a 100,000.  To think about getting  700,000 people together in a state
with a few million people is &gt;bemusing.


It's not about getting them together necessarily, it's just about giving
them the option to online. You don't have to use it, but you will be
included in it and might reap the benefits from its outcomes. This some of
that love thy neighbor stuff, I think we should be trying to rectify our
differences and this is a way to do it.

Again if there's a significant problem between areas it can be brought to
the attention of a larger audience (state, federal, world) these groups are
mostly unattached outsiders, they'll hopefully be able to  see who's in the
wrong and adjust the issue. If these larger groups can not see what's wrong
then maybe it's a broader issue and in that case it's probably worth
examining further and should be brought up so we can understand the issue
instead of hiding from it.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll start off by making a few presumptions, this is to introduce the
</I>&gt;<i> idea
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a global scale mindset. Everyone is plugged into a global system of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; governance, everyone's residence, annual income, everything is
</I>&gt;<i> documented.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Everyone has an equal say in which laws, projects etc. get passed by way
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; online forum or some mode of decision making process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recommend you read my Plan (current draft of which is always
</I>&gt;<i> available as <A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf">http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf</A>) for some
</I>&gt;<i> counterarguments.  There are a lot of problems with income-based
</I>&gt;<i> taxation system (e.g., large numbers of people, especially independent
</I>&gt;<i> contractors and those in the underground economy, simply cheat).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For simplicity sake, everyone has a flat tax in the world. 20% of
</I>&gt;<i> everyone's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; annual earnings go towards the governing body to be used for public
</I>&gt;<i> projects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; big and small, from installing a new bench in a public park to sending a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spaceship to mars. All the money comes from the 20% of humanities annual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; earnings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not a progressive tax?  The conservatives and one-percenters will love
</I>&gt;<i> this.  Everyone else, not so much...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My proposal is for a variable sales/consumption tax.  Much more
</I>&gt;<i> efficient to manage, much less cheating and other gaming of the
</I>&gt;<i> system, and at least partially progressive as a starting point.  I
</I>&gt;<i> beef up the progressive nature by eliminating inheritance, which
</I>&gt;<i> according to Piketty's data about 50% of all capital flows through at
</I>&gt;<i> some point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, every individual is part of one group at every level. I've label
</I>&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; group for simplicity but each group is defined by the numbers more then
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; title, municipal (700 thousand people), state (15 million people),
</I>&gt;<i> federal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (300 million people), global (7 billion people). The group that a
</I>&gt;<i> particular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individual is involved in exists within the boundaries of every
</I>&gt;<i> individual,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so your municipality would simply be the closest 700 thousand people to
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specific residence in the world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I recommend my Locality system over this: People need to group
</I>&gt;<i> according to needs and it's not reasonable to put rural residents in
</I>&gt;<i> with their nearest city because their needs are different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Every year the budget is set based on the collected tax, the taxes are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distributed between the groups (a federal group would have a higher
</I>&gt;<i> budget
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then a municipal group because more people are contributing to it), every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; group receives the same budget ( e.g. every municipality has a 30 million
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dollar budget, every state has 2 billion, etc.), every individual is
</I>&gt;<i> able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see the budget in each of their groups and witness it become diminished
</I>&gt;<i> over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the year as funds get diverted to projects passed by the people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good idea, and this is level of transparency is something seriously
</I>&gt;<i> lacking in all of our current systems.  But I think you need to tie
</I>&gt;<i> the distribution to the income from an area: Some will contribute less
</I>&gt;<i> simply because their cost of living (and/or standard of living) are
</I>&gt;<i> lower than other places.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, an individual has a project they'd like to do through the use of tax
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dollars. They pick their point on the map where the project is to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; constructed/implemented, then depending on which level they want to
</I>&gt;<i> funds to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; come from (might choose a larger group like federal if the project is
</I>&gt;<i> larger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in scale) the project is opened up to the closest number of people in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proximity to the project for discussion and voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about projects that cross boundaries?  I'm thinking of many types
</I>&gt;<i> of transportation projects, water storage/distribution, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; E.g. Somebody wants to use 2 million dollars of the municipal budget to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; construct a new gym for a high school, they appeal at the municipal
</I>&gt;<i> level to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fund the project, the closest 700 thousand people to the actual gym then
</I>&gt;<i> get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to debate the idea and vote on whether to grant the funds to complete the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project. If the idea passes then 2 million is taken out of the budget for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those 700 thousand people regardless of whether they voted for it or not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then another guy proposes another project on the other side of town that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; includes some of the people that voted on the gym project as well (it
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not include all of them, just the ones that are within the proximity of
</I>&gt;<i> both
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects) this project passes as well and more funds are taken out of
</I>&gt;<i> budget
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the affected individuals. Once the budget is used up it can no longer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fund projects within the area, it must appeal to a larger group or wait
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; next year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All very egalitarian, which is nice.  But not a very good match for
</I>&gt;<i> civilization as it exists today, so I wonder about how the transition
</I>&gt;<i> would occur?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is the gist of it, I can go into more detail but I just wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; introduce the idea and see what you guys thought of it.  There is proper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distribution of resources that get to be spent by the immediate
</I>&gt;<i> community.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It also includes a form of checks and balance approach with the larger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; groups being able to veto any project that might affect them as well.
</I>&gt;<i> This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; model destroys the notion of set borders, it morphs for every project to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; include the most immediately affected people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the elegance of the floating boundaries, but fear you've
</I>&gt;<i> glossed over the differences among the needs of people in these
</I>&gt;<i> relatively larger categories.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
