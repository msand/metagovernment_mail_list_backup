<PRE>Hello,

I have found a project <A HREF="http://en.gplvote.org/idea.html">http://en.gplvote.org/idea.html</A>
and I wanted to tell you about it.

This is a poor way how to make a note about a project. We have active 
projects and related projects lists for this purpose. The recent talk 
about vision made me think: What projects are related ? Those who are 
according to the vision or those who are similar to active projects ?

There is one more thing. As much as I can say, Ed and his authority 
prevent us from taking him as an ordinary member, we know who owns the site.

Kind regards
Michael

</PRE>
