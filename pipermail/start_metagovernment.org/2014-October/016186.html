Thanks!  Looks interesting, at least what I can tell from reading the
pages (which are mostly in Russian) through Google Translate.  Also
seems not very active at present.

&gt;<i> This is a poor way how to make a note about a project.
</I>
Actually it isn't, because I wouldn't have seen it if you had just
added it to the list on the MG site (which you should, now, too ;-)

&gt;<i> We have active
</I>&gt;<i> projects and related projects lists for this purpose. The recent talk about
</I>&gt;<i> vision made me think: What projects are related ? Those who are according to
</I>&gt;<i> the vision or those who are similar to active projects ?
</I>
Is this relevant?  Seems like only the government agents watching us
might find this information useful ;-_)

&gt;<i> There is one more thing. As much as I can say, Ed and his authority prevent
</I>&gt;<i> us from taking him as an ordinary member, we know who owns the site.
</I>
Agreed, and this would be a serious problem if the mission of
Metagovernment was to produce an actual product (as is the goal of
GPLvote) because it would reduce the credibility of that product.  But
as merely a forum for discussion, I don't see a problem unless we
start hearing about censorship or other misuse of our posts or
submissions to the website.
  Regards,
     Scott
