Unfortunately, I think the answer is yes.  But you'll get a chance to
fix this by adding your own proposal in the next round.

But this brings up what I think is a design flaw in the current
Vilfredo: The lack of a measure of *effectiveness* of the proposal.
All it seems to currently do is have people assess the *accuracy* of
the proposals with the result being that there is a strong force
applied to weaken them as much possible to avoid setting off anyone's
BS detector.  The result is like the new MG Home page, something
that's technically accurate but completely ineffective for its
(assumed) purpose.  In a Chinese philosophy sense, it's all &quot;yin&quot; and
no &quot;yang&quot;.  There needs to be an opposing (or complementary, if you're
a Taoist) force that would work to make the statements stronger and
therefore more effective.

I've been trying to think of how this would work and have a couple of
suggestions:
1) There needs to be some &quot;goal&quot; specified along with the original
question: How are we going to assess whether the output of the process
is a success or not?  In the case of the Home page, I would have
assumed it is primarily supposed to be a recruiting tool, to get
people to read the rest of the site and join the mailing list.  In one
sense the &quot;real world&quot; can be counted on to provide this feedback, but
that's too inefficient: By the time that feedback arrives the
organization may be dead (e.g., if some company used Vilfredo to
determine a feature list for their product or a marketing plan, they
need to know it will work *before* they launch because that is a
bet-the-company decision).

2) There needs to be two types of feedback, one on accuracy one on
effectiveness.  While I'm still more a &quot;ratings&quot; rather than &quot;yes/no&quot;
kind of guy, I think you can do it with a simple measure of whether
the participant believes the proposal would meet the goal or not.  Not
sure how to integrate these two measures (e.g., combine at each phase,
run parallel Pareto fronts, or wait until the end when the integration
and final vote occurs), but fortunately it's not my project so I don't
have to run the experiments to see which works best ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
