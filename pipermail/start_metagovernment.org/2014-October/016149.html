Sort of: We don't have to &quot;virtual world&quot; test the new political
system because that can be run in parallel with our existing systems
(i.e., a direct democracy using the same inputs that the existing
representative governments are getting, but hopefully providing
different (better) outputs).  I would assume adoption of the new
system would be from small (HOAs, school boards, etc.) to large, but
even this is not necessary.  My belief is we could set up a system
that would provide better results than the US congress relatively
easily, for example ;-)  Working on this part of the problem I think
is the purpose of metagovernment.org.

The Plan and Blinap are much more comprehensive than that, though, and
in particular I don't see any way to run the *economic* system in
parallel with our existing systems.  Which means those *do* need to be
extensively simulated and virtual-world tested before people should be
comfortable that throwing the switch won't cause chaos.  This is *not*
the purpose of metagovernment.org.  Maybe &quot;metaeconomics.org&quot; or
&quot;metacapitalism.org&quot; or something ;-)
