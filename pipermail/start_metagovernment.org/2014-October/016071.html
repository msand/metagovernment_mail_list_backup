<PRE>SOCIOCRACY


Hello all,

I would like to describe a bit the workshop I went to on Sociocracy 2 weeks
ago. The workshop made a strong impression on me, and made me reconsider
many of the concepts I have been working on in the last years. With this I
do not mean that everything about sociocracy is good and prefect and cannot
be made better. But it does mean that it represents a significant step
forward from anything I have seen so far around.


Sociocracy is a way for a group of people to govern themselves and take
decisions, with feedback mechanism. We were given this definition at the
beginning and it has proven quite true in hindsight.


My definition is that sociocracy is a set of tools, and &#8220;ways to do things&#8221;
that all together permit a group to govern itself without a clear authority
in place (although the system is at times hierarchical, and I am painfully
aware of this limitation).


As a set of tools and &#8220;ways to do things&quot;, it makes sense to study each of
them separately. But before we start with listing them, I have to admit
that reading about it, and actually doing it is not the same thing. I was
quite impressed to be in a workshop where the teacher asked for our
permission to start teaching (&#8220;Has anyone any objection that in those 2
days I will teach you sociocracy?&#8221;). It felt to be empowered in one of the
least empowering positions in life. The student chair. So reading this, and
trying it out will not be the same thing. You really need to try it out. A
little bit like reading hot to go on a bike or make love. Some things you
can read, but the actual experience is something different.


So the elements I could spot in Sociocracy were:


   - what is a circle
   - the facilitator,
   - how each action of the facilitator is very precise, nearly a ritual
   - the way in which a proposal is presented, and the steps to get it
   approved
   - what counts as an objection, and the minimum level of maturity for
   people participating necessary for Sociocracy to work.
   - how a role gets decided, and how a person gets elected to fill it
   - What are things being registered concerning a discussion
   - The difference between operation meetings, and policy meetings
   - The importance of vision, mission, aim (VMA), what they are, how to
   find them, what role do they play in a discussion.
   - How feedback are taken
   - How reviews to each decision (and the work done by people elected in
   specific roles) are being scheduled, and then each decision is being
   re-evaluated after some time.

For what I remember this completes the tools that are being used for a
small sociocracy circle (let&#8217;s say up to about 15-20 people, but better
around a dozen).

If there is a need to use socicoracy in a bigger organisation, then
different circles are being established, and a hierarchy (ugh!) among those
circles is established, with representatives and spokesperson for each
circle in each of the upper and lower circle. I personally do not like this
part of sociocracy, but apparently it works (we haven&#8217;t really tried this
out) and it has been developed on the basis of a very clear and well
established limit: the difficulty in taking decisions for groups bigger
than 20 people. Note that this is also the mathematical limit that Vilfredo
found, after which the Pareto Front starts to explode.

So while I think Sociocracy is a REALLY good way for small groups to
organise themselves and a good way for middle groups to organise
themselves. I am still doubtful that it can be used for, let&#8217;s say, a city
of the size of Rome with 4 million people inside.

*what is a circle*

A circle is group of people who share the same Aim. Once they meet
together, they chose among them a facilitator. Facilitator can be rapidly
chosen, or formally elected. And then they are formally elected, a
temporary facilitator is rapidly chosen, just to get the new one elected.
And then the job is passed on.

*The facilitator*

The facilitator is basically a moderator. He keeps track of where we are in
the agenda, what have we done, when there is a proposal will go through the
necessary steps to make sure everybody understands it, everybody can give
their first impression, everybody can express objections, and then either
assigns to someone to amend it to consider the objections (and then
repurpose it again) or if there are none, declares it passed. It should be
noted that the role of the facilitator is to strike a difficult balance
between equanimity between members, and effectiveness of the meeting (and
also respect for each person time)

*how each action of the facilitator is very precise, nearly a ritual*

It should be noted that the facilitator holds some real power, in giving
the power to speak, gathering objections. But this power is limited and
balanced by a series of things (it is incorrect, as I heard recently to say
that sociocracy has no check and balance system. They are some very well
embedded inside). SO a facilitator asks people to offer their objections,
and can ask to people if they think that even considering the objections
the proposal is &#8220;good enough for now, safe enough to try&#8221;. But as soon as
someone has an objection, and deems the proposal not good enough for now,
then the proposal CANNOT pass. As such it is a system where each person has
veto power, and that veto power balances the power of the facilitator (or
of any smaller group of people inside the circle that wants to dominate).
So the facilitator follows some very specific directives in the actions to
be taken, and everybody respects that. In other words there is no &#8220;free
discussion&quot; where anyone can just voice their opinion. Part of it is
because they tend to drift off making everybody speak about unrelated (and
not useful) topics. This is something similar to Vilfredo where everybody
is given a lot of power&#8230; except the power to just free comment anything
they want with any idea they have. The discussion is very strict, but in
this anyone has great power.

*How decisions are taken and what counts as an objection*

This is maybe what I really consider the core of how Sociocracy works and
why I think it is better than anything else. The short part of it is that:
a proposal passes if there is no objection. And objections are any
reasonable reason (yes, I really intended to stress the word reason) why it
should not be done or it would not be helpful to reach the aim. We haven&#8217;t
spoke about the aim, but in short that is what the circle is trying to
achieve. Anyone can suggest a proposal, and anyone can then present
objections. If there are no objections the proposal passes. If there are
objections the proposals is amended. Simple, right? It also sounds very
similar to consensus? It is not. But before looking at the differences, and
why this system is so different let us look exactly at how decisions are
taken. The structure is fairly clear:

   1. a proposal is presented
   2. the facilitator goes around, asking everybody if the proposal is
   clear. If anyone has any question, they people having the questions are
   noted. And then they can ask clarifications. All this until all have
   understood the proposal
   3. the facilitator goes around asking each person a rapid response, or a
   gut reaction, to the proposal. Just if people like it or not. It kind of
   gives a sense to everybody of where the circle stands.
   4. the facilitator goes around and ask each person if they have any
   reasonable objection to the proposal. People can answer: objection,
   consent, connect with concern. Objection means that the person has some
   reasons why the proposal should not pass. As long as those are not solved
   the proposal will not pass, so it is equivalent to a reasoned veto. But it
   also gives indication on how the proposal should be changed to satisfy
   them. Consent means that the person is ok with the proposal. And consent
   with concern means that the person has no reasonable objection, to the
   proposal, but he or she does have some concerns. Note that people who have
   objections, at this round do NOT say what the objection is.
   5. if there are objections, the facilitator goes and asks, one by one
   what the objections are. Then a new proposal is drawn using them as
   guidelines. This can be done by the author of the first one, by the person
   objecting (like in Vilfredo key players are invited to rewrite a proposal),
   by someone else, by the facilitator itself, by the circle, or by a team
   selected for the reason. Sometimes this is done on the spot, others it is
   given as a task to be done at home by those people. The proposal once
   amended is then re-proposed to the circle, and the procedure happens again.
   6. If there are no objection the facilitator CAN (but does not have to)
   hear the concerns. And the proposal CAN be amended. Here is where the
   facilitator has more power, and can just ask if the proposal is &#8220;good
   enough for now, safe enough to try&#8221;. And if all agree to that the proposal
   passes.
   7. A proposal with no objections passes.

Now that I have explained how the process of simple decision making works
let me explain why I consider this method superior to any other method I
have seen so far (I exclude Vilfredo which is pretty similar). Objections
are considered. No one can have a proposal been chucked up his throat. On
the other side this veto power can only be used for reasonable reasons. It
is important that any personal mythology, belief system, unreasonable
assumptions, personal biases, are either suspended. Or somehow made
explicit, and a person accepts not to act based on it. Apparently to do
this people need to be at a certain level of maturity, and even the most
mature people, when tired slip back into becoming emotional and
unreasonable. This is not to say that someone who is in touch with their
emotion cannot participate actively in Sociocracy. It is more that reason
represents the foundations of the participation. Anything else should
enrich it, but not substitute it.

Also it is VERY important to note that there is no time where people vote
if they &#8220;like&#8221; a proposal. No counting of the votes. If you like a proposal
or not is irrelevant. The only thing relevant is: &#8220;do you have reasonable
objections to it&#8221; that shows how it would hinder us or not help us in
reaching our aim. As such all the neutral people, and also people that
might not like a proposal still will not stop it. This is VERY powerful, as
in one step sidesteps all the majority versus minority elements of voting
theory.

*Vilfredo versus Sociocracy*

Vilfredo is much younger than sociocracy, and rediscovered many of the same
solutions Sociocracy found. In a sense Vilfredo resembles a tool for
decision making for 1 circle in Sociocracy. The main difference is that
Vilfredo has no Facilitator, instead there is an Artificial Intelligence,
that fulfils that role. It also has no understanding of what is being
discussed, which makes it a bit harder for the (AI-)facilitator, but it
assures a greater equanimity in the way everybody is treated. Also being an
AI it is less bound by human limits, so it can facilitate multiple people
doing different tasks. Thus Vilfredo is inherently parallel, while
Sociocratic discussion is linear (or circular).

*The rest*

There are several  other steps that are part of Sociocracy. Both in terms
of how does it work inside a circle, and how circles relate to each other.
I know the major critics about it where on how circles relate to each
other. And I also have some doubts about it. But I did suspend my judgment
until I can see it working. Also noticing that the system with little (but
meaningful) differences have been used both my people in companies, than
from people in communities. And the people in communities are among the
most paranoid in terms of hierarchical power, and need to have their voice
heard, and be represented. Those are people who are willing to sit for
hours in a circle hearing each person voice their opinion with no time
limit, waiting until a full consensus emerges. As such the fact that this
system satisfies THEM, is a pretty good indication to me that it cannot be
as bad as common voting systems.


I hope this helps. Tomorrow I will have to travel, so I will not be able to
answer except maybe very briefly. I will try to answer any question later.
Or I am sure Gustav (who I gather has more experience of Sociocracy than
me) can answer them. Also, Gustav, please feel free to correct me. All I
wrote represents my understanding of a 3 days workshop in London.

Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It might help you, but also should help everyone else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A good overview, although the &quot;simulations&quot; lack a little real-world
</I>&gt;<i> feel to them (somehow they managed to create corporations with no
</I>&gt;<i> assholes in them!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also would like to correct my previous analysis of the depth chart:
</I>&gt;<i> Seems there must be *two* reps from a lower circle to a higher circle
</I>&gt;<i> to provide bidirectional feedback.  It also occurs to me that circles
</I>&gt;<i> will frequently have less than the full 40-member complement,

</I>&gt;<i> you need to add at least a couple to my level predictions (i.e., a
</I>&gt;<i> global government would be 8 or more levels deep, which is definitely
</I>&gt;<i> *way* too many).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (snip)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thus, sociocracy offers a lot of freedom to choose what and how to do
</I>&gt;<i> stuff,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while still retaining the right for anyone in the community to ask for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision revocation if they have rational objections. It takes more time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than usual for decisions to take place, but that's also why certain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisions are more often than not being delegated (while still being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; continuously analyzed and - if necessary - reviewed by the community).
</I>&gt;<i> Which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is fine by me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, sort of: looks to me like as long as the &quot;consent&quot; rule is
</I>&gt;<i> followed there is a lot of flexibility in the way decisions are made.
</I>&gt;<i> But again, as with consensus, this requires a world (or at least an
</I>&gt;<i> organization) without assholes.  We don't live in that world...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [Jacopo]&gt; 2 does direct democracy need executive officers? Because if it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does I did not understand even what Direct Democracy is!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It doesn't really. I may be wrong, but I believe that Athenian direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democracy was a social system which had a very different way of dealing
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary powers activities seen nowadays.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, I think different people will define direct democracy in
</I>&gt;<i> different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ways, the common ground being that it should be a kind of social
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organization model where people directly participate as much as possible
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the political decisions of the community. I think it is not out of the
</I>&gt;<i> realm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of possibility that these decisions could extend into activities of what
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know as the Executive and Judiciary powers. However, the usual way that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people refers to direct democracy nowadays is that it should substitute
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; representative system observed within the Legislative power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, but I see no mechanism for a judicial branch in sociocracy.
</I>&gt;<i> The executive branch I think still exists because there remains a
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy and although the executives (CEO, department heads, foremen,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) have greatly reduced power compared with traditional
</I>&gt;<i> organizations, they still seem to me to have the authority to direct
</I>&gt;<i> action after a decision has been made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The big impedance mismatch between sociocracy and what is required for
</I>&gt;<i> civil government in general is even more clear to me after reading
</I>&gt;<i> that article: Like religious groups corporations are a *lot* more
</I>&gt;<i> homogeneous than the general population.  Although they lack the
</I>&gt;<i> normative power of religion, they have something even better: A common
</I>&gt;<i> purpose.  People are willing to sacrifice a *lot* in the name of a
</I>&gt;<i> common purpose, which is why abuse of the population is so much easier
</I>&gt;<i> in wartime.  And in a corporation, it's always wartime ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which brings up another question WRT the purpose of metagovernment:
</I>&gt;<i> Are we all interested in *any* type of organization, or only those
</I>&gt;<i> that can be applied to governing free populations and not just
</I>&gt;<i> homogeneous organizations?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (snip)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, sociocracy was formulated as a system for organizing a very real
</I>&gt;<i> (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; somewhat successful) business, and it is being used today within very
</I>&gt;<i> real
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; businesses (with varying degrees of success, I would believe). But I am
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sure how it would translate into a governance system in the public
</I>&gt;<i> sector,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as I have no experience whatsoever with that. As a public sector employee
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; myself I believe it would be very very hard, because I think it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; require an extensive change in mindset from too many people for it to
</I>&gt;<i> really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And again, even public sector is far more homogeneous than the general
</I>&gt;<i> population because again you have at least *some* common goals.  I've
</I>&gt;<i> spent a lot of time debating libertarians and even a few reactionaries
</I>&gt;<i> on FaceBook over the past few weeks and can now say with some
</I>&gt;<i> certainty that getting any of them to agree to a system like this is
</I>&gt;<i> just out of the realm of possibility.  But they are far more receptive
</I>&gt;<i> to the idea of direct democracy and I think if you provided them with
</I>&gt;<i> a system that allowed them to work in it *without* having their
</I>&gt;<i> (sometimes quite astounding) prejudices constantly being challenged,
</I>&gt;<i> they'd probably use it.  We need to design a system to work with
</I>&gt;<i> people however they come to it, not one that requires a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> education, particularly if it also requires anyone to sacrifice their
</I>&gt;<i> prejudices.  Most people are just unwilling or unable to do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, it should work really well for organizations such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagovernment!  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think how long it took us to come up with the horribly watered-down
</I>&gt;<i> Home page in the last round is a counter-example.  The concept of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consent&quot; I think is a pretty apt description of how Vilfredo was
</I>&gt;<i> working (and indeed how we were instructed to use it) toward the end
</I>&gt;<i> there.  I for one would have preferred a more forceful statement, even
</I>&gt;<i> if I didn't agree with all of it, than what we ended up with.  My
</I>&gt;<i> opinion is that this kind of homeopathic result is just characteristic
</I>&gt;<i> of consent/consensus based systems.
