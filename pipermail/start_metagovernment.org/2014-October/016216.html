<PRE>So, I read Altemeyer. Thank you for that book, I will keep his findings 
in mind.

In your book draft I am on page 21 and I lack more continuity in 
explanation. Still I have some notes to what I have read.
You are talking about Globality there, that I expect to be global. I 
would like to note to this that Double Highs and other high RWAs will 
probably seem ridiculously week in global context, unable to collect 
significantly more votes than on national level, thus much less percent 
in global context.

I was also thinking about the filters a little bit more. The thing is 
that we are unable to enter most of the useful filters into the voting 
mechanism ( and that is maybe right, it is so easy to make a mistake). 
On the other hand we might be able to enter a mechanism that allows to 
create personal filters. We may allow the citizen to say that anybody 
who suits some conditions can in some proportion decide for her. You may 
see it as a proposal for improvement of proxies. E.g. when you will not 
have enough time, you will bind your vote with condition, that the group 
of people who have passed your psychological amygdala test may 
proportionally decide for you. Your condition will be public and others 
may join it, too. You may also say that in all proposals that contain 
the word &quot;chemistry&quot;, you will be represented just by people who have 
certain degree in chemistry (from certain universities)(you may make 
your amygdala test to apply too).

What do you think ?

Kind regards
     Michael

</I>&gt;<i> I believe before you try to tackle my stuff you really need to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Doing that you will gain an appreciation for why I believe that any
</I>&gt;<i> representative-based government is fatally flawed: The people that
</I>&gt;<i> rise to serve in those types of systems are just inherently incapable
</I>&gt;<i> of doing the job properly.  It's just the nature of their
</I>&gt;<i> personalities which I think is made astoundingly clear in Altemeyer's
</I>&gt;<i> Global Change Game experiment, which I rank up there with the Milgram
</I>&gt;<i> experiment in terms of its importance.  Unfortunately it has received
</I>&gt;<i> less than a ten-thousandth as much coverage, IMHO mostly because of
</I>&gt;<i> political correctness issues (i.e., singling out 25% of the population
</I>&gt;<i> as the source of the majority of our problems just goes against the
</I>&gt;<i> zeitgeist, unlike Milgram which purports to show that everyone could
</I>&gt;<i> become a Nazi which for some reason is so much more comforting ;-)
