I'm thinking this isn't playing fair: Unless you're going to reject
science as the basis of engineering (which at its core is what *all*
of us are doing, or at least proposing to do), you're pretty much
stuck arguing within the system...

&gt;<i> Axiom of choice says every collection is a set.  If this applies to the
</I>&gt;<i> mundane world then every arbitrary collection is not only homogeneous but it
</I>&gt;<i> includes all the items that are homogeneous, excluding none improperly.
</I>
In theory: In practice you'll find that a randomly chosen &quot;set&quot; of
people are pretty much non-homogeneous in their political outlook and
behavior.

&gt;<i> I suppose I need to say the axiom does have physical reality.  But the
</I>&gt;<i> matter is a bit complex.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But all the collections you will come across are homogeneous and the
</I>&gt;<i> understanding and usefulness of this is limited by the computational
</I>&gt;<i> capability of the universe.  Notice that the word in question then become
</I>&gt;<i> meaningless in scientism.
</I>
As this whole exercise is for the purposes of engineering...

&gt;<i> You might want to think about how 5000 people can get together and reach
</I>&gt;<i> consensus by treating that as outside of scientism.
</I>
Right, it's in the realm of fantasy or wishful thinking.  Unless maybe
they're all members of a religious cult or something, in which case
homogeneity is enforced by cultural norms (as indeed it was in the
soviets).  My proposal is that we're not cultural engineers, nor
should we aspire to be: We need to design systems that work with
people as they come to it, not try to change them to fit the system.
Which is what I see the consent/consensus aficionados trying to do.
If anyone is following that debate on the AG list (a German list for
the Pirate Party) you'll appreciate the irony of how subgroups intent
on developing consensus-based systems are hoist by their own petard.
