Right. Though I don&#8217;t see the point in dwelling on what democracy and government should be...or could be.
The *system* (as we know it) is no longer valid or useful as a tool for managing our affairs. We've used 'democracy&#8217; as a front to proselytize our imperial ambitions, and &#8216;government' is the behemoth running the machine that&#8217;s taken us to the edge. I no longer see the value in associating what&#8217;s emerging with those words (or concepts). Too much baggage!  But, call it what you want&#8230;.I think the most important thing is that we begin designing and developing the next iteration. And that we do it soon&#8230;.like now.
