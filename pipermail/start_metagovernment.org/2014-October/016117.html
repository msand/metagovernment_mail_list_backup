<PRE>I have not been able to pay much attention to my email in the past week, and now I have 76 messages in this list I have not read, and I still have very little time, so will remain behind. I&#8217;d like to reiterate that is may be helpful for important conversations to be summarized with pages on the wiki. And that we have monthly meetings not only to discuss topics intensively, but also to review what has gone on on the list in the past month.

But this thread did catch my eye, and I have submitted an alternate proposal. Mine lists some objections to the standing one, and I'll reiterate them here:

There are a couple problems with &quot;democratization of global governance.&quot;

&quot;Democracy&quot; is a totally ambiguous term these days. The term &quot;democratization of global governance&quot; could be taken to mean that we want the government of China to be more like the government of the United States.

And &quot;global governance&quot; sounds like world government. While we are aiming for global, decentralized, and/or non-specific systems and communities; I don't want people to think we're trying to make one global government of the world. Something along those lines is more of a vision thing anyway. And our vision statement implies that.


There are a bunch of other proposals listed in the standing proposal. They certainly should be addressed too, but not as bits buried in this proposal. Especially the project to overhaul the list of Active Projects and Related Projects.

Michael had a great idea for how to approach it, in this thread starting here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-April/005464.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-April/005464.html</A>
but he required some upgrades to the wiki for it to get done. I can try to install those if someone wants to take it on that way. Or we could take a less technological approach and try to sort manually. But using semantic wiki does have some very nice long-term implications for a sophisticated list.

Note Michael&#8217;s idea was revisited somewhat in this thread:
