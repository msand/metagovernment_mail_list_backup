<PRE>Yeah, outliers (like those infamous Quakers) are not really useful for
our purposes.

Being an engineer, efficiency and effectiveness would have to top my
list.  I.e., there has to *be* a decision, it has to be achievable
with a reasonable expenditure of effor

Informative.  I think we do not share purpose in a particularly useful way.
Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You basically argue that we are doing engineering and engineering might
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be the skilled application of scientific results and then say there is no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; science just pragmatism.  Okay.  We were able to build steel bridges that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; did not fall down with no science.  It took 20 years of trying.  You
</I>&gt;<i> invoke
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; science where there is no science as you might understand.  There is a
</I>&gt;<i> world
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out there where you can be asciencism  and still get results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You maybe have too high a standard for what is science: Building
</I>&gt;<i> bridges that fall down *is* science by my definition, at least if you
</I>&gt;<i> take any time to try to figure out why they failed.  Engineering is
</I>&gt;<i> the phase when you know enough to build bridges that don't fall down.
</I>&gt;<i> And while I'd agree that the science of decisionmaking (and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> indeed of all of psychology) is very primitive compared with &quot;hard&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> sciences, there is still much to be gained by taking the most robust
</I>&gt;<i> findings into consideration in our designs (e.g., Altemeyer, Milgram,
</I>&gt;<i> Aronson, Arrow, etc.).  Some of our new bridges will still fall down,
</I>&gt;<i> but hopefully what we know about social psychology and political
</I>&gt;<i> economics will cut a few years off the time it takes to build our
</I>&gt;<i> first usable bridge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway putting &quot;set&quot; in quotations confuses me.  We spent 1000 years at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; least getting a good definition and what we have is underneath the math
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; axioms which you might think underlies acience which underlies
</I>&gt;<i> engineering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which you might think underlies this discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A randomly-selected group of people is only a &quot;set&quot; in mathematical
</I>&gt;<i> sense, and the quotes are because you can't use pure mathematical
</I>&gt;<i> tools to predict or control human behavior.  Maybe statistics, but
</I>&gt;<i> that's not the kind of math you're referring to...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the end point, which text I did suppress, a good goal might be better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisions.  So what values of better do you value?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being an engineer, efficiency and effectiveness would have to top my
</I>&gt;<i> list.  I.e., there has to *be* a decision, it has to be achievable
</I>&gt;<i> with a reasonable expenditure of effort, and the resulting policy
</I>&gt;<i> would have to be implementable and achieve the desired result.  Note
</I>&gt;<i> that including consent/consensus as part of the design works strongly
</I>&gt;<i> against the first two, and is although it helps with the third, it
</I>&gt;<i> certainly isn't a necessary component.  As I've stated before (and
</I>&gt;<i> studies have shown), people will obey a law they don't like and
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't vote for as long as they consider it to be moral.  Our job as
</I>&gt;<i> social engineers isn't to make everyone happy or give everyone warm
</I>&gt;<i> fuzzy feelings that their input is valued.  We just need to build
</I>&gt;<i> systems that are better than those we're currently using which are not
</I>&gt;<i> only corrupt and inefficient, but are so unreliable that they put our
</I>&gt;<i> very existence as a species at risk.
