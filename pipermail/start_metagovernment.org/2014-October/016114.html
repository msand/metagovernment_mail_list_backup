</I>
Agreed, but that's not what I said: I said resource *redistribution*.
Taking from Peter to pay Paul.  Taxation for welfare.  This is *not*
something corporations do because they expect a return on every
investment.

&gt;<i> The issue is that (for the most part) the
</I>&gt;<i> mission of the corporate model is based on a fairly narrow or short sighted
</I>&gt;<i> self-interest.  (resource distribution for the organization)  As we continue
</I>&gt;<i> to understand our connection and interdependence at a global scale, I
</I>&gt;<i> believe we&#8230;(the makers and owners of corporations) will continue to respond
</I>&gt;<i> commensurate to this realization.
</I>
I'm confused: You expect corporations to &quot;realize&quot; that they are
responsible for welfare programs?

&gt;<i> What happens when a group of competitive individuals comes to the
</I>&gt;<i> realization that it is in their best interest to cooperate? I would say that
</I>&gt;<i> they begin to form an &quot;extremely homogeneous domain&#8221;.   Unless they are just
</I>&gt;<i> plain stupid&#8230;.in which case they continue to complete and ultimately destroy
</I>&gt;<i> themselves and their environment.  Oh well, it&#8217;s a huge universe.  No great
</I>&gt;<i> loss.
</I>
You've just described the history of the human race, only the &quot;destroy
themselves and their environment&quot; hasn't happened (yet).  I don't see
a proposal in there anywhere that would indicate that there's anyway
out of this fate...

&gt;<i> Our world is incredibly complex and continually evolving.  We are positioned
</I>&gt;<i> at the vanguard of this endeavor.  Why hang on so to historical
</I>&gt;<i> interpretations of our capabilities?  Why limit *us* to such a baseline
</I>&gt;<i> prescription of possibility?
</I>
This is a good point, and one that justified Marxism and a lot of
Hitler and Mao's &quot;experiments&quot;.  Those didn't end so well, mostly
because they were amateurs as social engineers (and I'm putting Moses
and Jesus and Mohammed and my new favorite, Abraham Lincoln, in that
same category).  Of course most of those were *also* authoritarians
which had a lot to do with why their designs had so many built-in
flaws, but even without those they all I believe caused a lot more
suffering than they have alleviated.

If we're to do better, we have to be able to distinguish which of our
instinctive behaviors we can suppress, and which we can't.  Those
amateurs all got it wrong and I'm working the science to try to
understand why.

&gt;<i> People simply don't follow laws that they
</I>&gt;<i> consider immoral, and while we can count on a certain amount of help
</I>&gt;<i> from human's instinctive conceptions of fairness (which other animals
</I>&gt;<i> share, telling us that it's a deeply embedded one), you can't
</I>&gt;<i> legislate morality which is what your proposal, and any sort of
</I>&gt;<i> cooperative design, would require.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If people &quot;simply don&#8217;t follow laws they consider immoral&quot;&#8230;.then we won&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> need to &quot;legislate morality&#8221;&#8230;.will we?  :)
</I>
Not that this stops people from trying ;-)  Especially those amateur
social engineers.  But you're right, I'm sure there's enough built-in
morality to make a reasonable legal system (or moral code, if you
prefer to call it that) but it's tricky because we weren't evolved to
suit the environment we find ourselves living in.

&gt;<i> I&#8217;m not interested in legislating anything. I&#8217;m just connecting the dots
</I>&gt;<i> that I *see*.  It&#8217;s a totally subjective exercise. From my orientation, the
</I>&gt;<i> real world is far too big and complex for any of us to accurately describe
</I>&gt;<i> given our very limited (human) architecture. In my mind, it&#8217;s a bit foolish
</I>&gt;<i> to frame what we see as truth (especially if we label it in terms of right
</I>&gt;<i> or wrong).  It&#8217;s all our *story*&#8230;. narratives upon narratives of our very
</I>&gt;<i> limited perceptions and ensuing interpretations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And given that how we *see* has some effect on what (seems to) show up&#8230;why
</I>&gt;<i> not see, or imagine, or tell the best story possible?
</I>
Meh, a little too mystical for me.  I'm an engineer: Explain to me how
it's actually built.

&gt;<i> You can lead a horse to water&#8230;.but you can&#8217;t make them drink.
</I>&gt;<i> And if they don&#8217;t drink&#8230;what happens?
</I>
It's actually worse than that: That 25% are screaming about how the
water is poisoned and so *nobody* should drink it.  But progress has
happened without them many times in the past, so I'm sure we can do it
again so long as we understand that they're not going to be
participating in consent/consensus decisionmaking process any more
than the feudal lords or slave owners or those who opposed women's
suffrage (like just about half the legislators in southern states)
did.
  Regards,
    Scott
