&gt;<i> I'll start off by making a few presumptions, this is to introduce the idea
</I>&gt;<i> in a global scale mindset. Everyone is plugged into a global system of
</I>&gt;<i> governance, everyone's residence, annual income, everything is documented.
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone has an equal say in which laws, projects etc. get passed by way of
</I>&gt;<i> online forum or some mode of decision making process.
</I>
I recommend you read my Plan (current draft of which is always
available as <A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf">http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf</A>) for some
counterarguments.  There are a lot of problems with income-based
taxation system (e.g., large numbers of people, especially independent
contractors and those in the underground economy, simply cheat).

&gt;<i> For simplicity sake, everyone has a flat tax in the world. 20% of everyone's
</I>&gt;<i> annual earnings go towards the governing body to be used for public projects
</I>&gt;<i> big and small, from installing a new bench in a public park to sending a
</I>&gt;<i> spaceship to mars. All the money comes from the 20% of humanities annual
</I>&gt;<i> earnings.
</I>
Not a progressive tax?  The conservatives and one-percenters will love
this.  Everyone else, not so much...

My proposal is for a variable sales/consumption tax.  Much more
efficient to manage, much less cheating and other gaming of the
system, and at least partially progressive as a starting point.  I
beef up the progressive nature by eliminating inheritance, which
according to Piketty's data about 50% of all capital flows through at
some point.

&gt;<i> Now, every individual is part of one group at every level. I've label each
</I>&gt;<i> group for simplicity but each group is defined by the numbers more then the
</I>&gt;<i> title, municipal (700 thousand people), state (15 million people), federal
</I>&gt;<i> (300 million people), global (7 billion people). The group that a particular
</I>&gt;<i> individual is involved in exists within the boundaries of every individual,
</I>&gt;<i> so your municipality would simply be the closest 700 thousand people to your
</I>&gt;<i> specific residence in the world.
</I>
Again, I recommend my Locality system over this: People need to group
according to needs and it's not reasonable to put rural residents in
with their nearest city because their needs are different.

&gt;<i> Every year the budget is set based on the collected tax, the taxes are
</I>&gt;<i> distributed between the groups (a federal group would have a higher budget
</I>&gt;<i> then a municipal group because more people are contributing to it), every
</I>&gt;<i> group receives the same budget ( e.g. every municipality has a 30 million
</I>&gt;<i> dollar budget, every state has 2 billion, etc.), every individual is able to
</I>&gt;<i> see the budget in each of their groups and witness it become diminished over
</I>&gt;<i> the year as funds get diverted to projects passed by the people.
</I>
Good idea, and this is level of transparency is something seriously
lacking in all of our current systems.  But I think you need to tie
the distribution to the income from an area: Some will contribute less
simply because their cost of living (and/or standard of living) are
lower than other places.

&gt;<i> So, an individual has a project they'd like to do through the use of tax
</I>&gt;<i> dollars. They pick their point on the map where the project is to be
</I>&gt;<i> constructed/implemented, then depending on which level they want to funds to
</I>&gt;<i> come from (might choose a larger group like federal if the project is larger
</I>&gt;<i> in scale) the project is opened up to the closest number of people in
</I>&gt;<i> proximity to the project for discussion and voting.
</I>
What about projects that cross boundaries?  I'm thinking of many types
of transportation projects, water storage/distribution, etc.

&gt;<i> E.g. Somebody wants to use 2 million dollars of the municipal budget to
</I>&gt;<i> construct a new gym for a high school, they appeal at the municipal level to
</I>&gt;<i> fund the project, the closest 700 thousand people to the actual gym then get
</I>&gt;<i> to debate the idea and vote on whether to grant the funds to complete the
</I>&gt;<i> project. If the idea passes then 2 million is taken out of the budget for
</I>&gt;<i> those 700 thousand people regardless of whether they voted for it or not.
</I>&gt;<i> Then another guy proposes another project on the other side of town that
</I>&gt;<i> includes some of the people that voted on the gym project as well (it will
</I>&gt;<i> not include all of them, just the ones that are within the proximity of both
</I>&gt;<i> projects) this project passes as well and more funds are taken out of budget
</I>&gt;<i> of the affected individuals. Once the budget is used up it can no longer
</I>&gt;<i> fund projects within the area, it must appeal to a larger group or wait for
</I>&gt;<i> next year.
</I>
All very egalitarian, which is nice.  But not a very good match for
civilization as it exists today, so I wonder about how the transition
would occur?

&gt;<i> This is the gist of it, I can go into more detail but I just wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> introduce the idea and see what you guys thought of it.  There is proper
</I>&gt;<i> distribution of resources that get to be spent by the immediate community.
</I>&gt;<i> It also includes a form of checks and balance approach with the larger
</I>&gt;<i> groups being able to veto any project that might affect them as well. This
</I>&gt;<i> model destroys the notion of set borders, it morphs for every project to
</I>&gt;<i> include the most immediately affected people.
</I>
I like the elegance of the floating boundaries, but fear you've
glossed over the differences among the needs of people in these
relatively larger categories.
  Regards,
    Scott
