<PRE>Dear all
I read with much interest the analysis of Stefano and as said before by Ben
there is not silver bullet to solve all this problems, but a coordinated
approach to a single analysis will definitely make all of our energies into
a better use for the benefit of all (collective Intelligence). I hope every
one can agree with that. If we divide and disperse energy in to programming
different software platforms that do the same work we fail to serve the
purpose. I sent this e-mail to all the groups I participate that I feel
they share the same vision. I do not invent anything I just apply the
common sense learn from history and the greats motto that made changes
possible first of all the concept of UNITE.
(dividi et impera, el pueblo unidos hamas sera vencido etc etc)
We need to place our pride aside and place the world community interest in
the center.
Identify common denominator, we call them principles in the metagovernment
group, and if we all agree on those principles, we can form a supranational
entity that can unite all the groups. I believe we (metagovernment, loomio,
democracyos, airesis, tecnologie democratiche) all have this supranational
goal in mind but i doubt that any of us is ready or capable to take this
task. I recall every one to the sense of responsibility we have, given what
we have decided to do in our respective and separated projects, I beg all
of you to make this UNITE concept yours and think about how to implement it
BEFORE continuing developing your own platform.
Is a matter of collective intelligence!
Peace
Jacopo

PS I hope this message reach in the respective ML of Democracyos and Loomio
by the respective representative Ben and Felipe

&gt;<i> Dear Jacopo,
</I>&gt;<i> dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for including me in this ML.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I can't remember whether it was Benjamin I met in San Francisco,
</I>&gt;<i> together with Alanna, at the #PBConf two weeks ago. Were you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, this email came at the right moment. I was in California and
</I>&gt;<i> I came back to Italy with a firm believe we need to work of that (how don't
</I>&gt;<i> know how, but we must!). Jacopo knows how I strongly believe on
</I>&gt;<i> Participatory Budgeting as a way to undermine the current democracy and
</I>&gt;<i> rebuild a new one. So I am the first who can sustain any effort to spread
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point is that, yes, we didn't find the panacea to solve all the global
</I>&gt;<i> problems already - there are still many ideas of PB and democracy too! -
</I>&gt;<i> but we must join forces anyway, at least to take all advantage of the
</I>&gt;<i> progress which can from one or another of ours experiments: what will
</I>&gt;<i> happen if I (had to) start developing my software and then I realize that
</I>&gt;<i> the Jacopo's is working so much better that is worthy to divert and going
</I>&gt;<i> to help him? Or if I would like to take a piece of someone else's job to
</I>&gt;<i> integrate to my software and viceversa (the login, a particular
</I>&gt;<i> deliberative tool such as Loomio or within Airesis)? To sum up, is interoperability
</I>&gt;<i> enough - no matter how useful it is anyway - or do you think that another
</I>&gt;<i> step ahead could be possible, towards a kind of &quot;common language&quot;, a common
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;code&quot; to adopt, thus avoiding any risk of duplication? Jacopo well know
</I>&gt;<i> what I am talking about, unfortunately. We made a Conference
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://codicidellademocrazia.partecipate.it/">http://codicidellademocrazia.partecipate.it/</A>&gt;to debate on that issue,
</I>&gt;<i> and it is still difficult to find a common ground, to work together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am sorry but I am not a programmer, I am a political scientist. I am
</I>&gt;<i> usually very naive on such stuffs and I am glad to share them with you
</I>&gt;<i> all. But the experience of the last years tells me that a &quot;meta-language&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> a common framework, is necessary...at least to keep walking together, even
</I>&gt;<i> if not necessarily to the same path.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, I do strongly believe we need to find a common &quot;democratic&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ground anyway, then promote and pursue, implementing, it. It must be done
</I>&gt;<i> in both digital and &quot;analogical&quot; way. Building a software is probably not
</I>&gt;<i> enough, we need to build up also a movement who can spread such idea of
</I>&gt;<i> democracy (and thus the software which can facilitate it). Similarly to
</I>&gt;<i> what is happening for the OpenData: I believe this issue won't have the
</I>&gt;<i> impact on democracy we are looking for, but the broad interest and
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge on it is gathering lots of energies towards its aims.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope to hear from you soon.
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Stefano S.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I had the privilege to meet Benjamin today the 11th of October 2014 via
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hangouts and discuss the potential collaboration between the two platform.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Each of us represented the reference projects in the best interest of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the world not of the related project.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There was a brief presentation of each projects and the values that we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> share and we had a complete match on the values.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We both agree that there is no silver bullet for the realization of a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> new governance.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We share the same common denominator of the necessity of extended or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> total interoperability of the platform.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> With surprise we realize that we are both discussing with DemocracyOS
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the need for interoperability, Benjamin mention also that they are seeking
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> collaboration with other platform and I ask him to list them here and to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which extent.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ( I close the windows and lost the note we share in the chat!!)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Benjamin meet with Pietro Speroni and with Giovanni Allegretti and we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> share the same idea on the need of a participatory budgeting module, I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mention the module architecture we are seeking to deliver and the vision
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> was shared.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Both platform are developed in Ruby and both platform are released in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> AGPL3.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Loomio that is released in beta will officially release a final version
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in November.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Airesis is in the testing phase of the 4.0 version that will be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> released when our testing will be completed and the platform sufficiently
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stable.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> While Airesis is developed by us as a full platform, Loomio is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> considered more as a module in a framework.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The Loomio team is definitely better in collecting funds, in contrast
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> our political situation is definitely worst, I mention how the M5S have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> twisted the direct participation into a closed platform, while NZ i
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> definitely a better place for this kind of development.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I mention the structure of Tecnologie Democratiche Association and I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> did not ask how they are structured.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The development process of the two platform is decided in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> respective platform in an identical way.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Benjamin and I agreed to bring the discussion further in the direction
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the development of Open API and we agree that as soon as any of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> group produce a quality document in this regard we should share the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> knowledge and  establish direct analyst and programmer communication in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> order to further explore and implement interoperability. At this time both
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> head developers are completely absorbed by their  internal tasks and we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> identified end of November early December as the best time to reopen
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My final judgment of the meeting is an A+ or in our standard a 10 e
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lode.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I ask Benjamin to comment on this report, add as pleased and disclose
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the full report to the Airesis and Loomio mailing list. (Benjamin you can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> send it to me and I will publish in our ML)
