<PRE>Hello,

I would like to move the *discussion* about new mission and mission 
statement of Metagovernment here. Still keep entering your official 
proposals to Vilfredo please, it is useful for understanding.

Why do I want you to ask the question about mission and not any other ? 
The question about mission is pragmatic. I believe it is the level where 
we should be united, if we want to talk into politics.

What should be the mission of metagovernment.org ?
2847: Proposal Abstract
&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to map and support the 
development of tools and projects for democratization of global governance.&quot;

with explanation here www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:MichaelS#Mission

There was a question on Vilfredo
What does &quot;map&quot; mean in this context?
  I ment :
to find the position of something, or to find the positions of the parts 
of something
  from <A HREF="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/map_10">http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/map_10</A>
I believe there is a better word for it. Practically it should mean this.
Somebody finds a related project like this <A HREF="http://www.pppp.ca/registry/#The">http://www.pppp.ca/registry/#The</A>
or this <A HREF="http://www.websm.org/">http://www.websm.org/</A> and you will add it to the ordered list of 
related projects. Maybe you will add it to more categories: Monetary 
projects, social choice projects, publicity projects....

Next comment was
I also believe that in the mission should be outlined that 
metagovernment is aware that there are forces against such 
democratization, forces that tend to divide society in opposing group. 
Therefore, is necessary to search for some sort of convergence into a 
one flexible and integrated system

Kind regards
Michael
