<PRE>is this a role playing game? its like one of those late nights playing risk
and nobody gets anywhere. i have been kicking it with you good lads for
almost 2 years and i witness so much brilliance but no cock and balls.
we need the app to start using it.
prototype.
i have pushed this project because its a fantastic idea but it need motion
to gain the inertia to continue to grow.

</I>&gt;<i> from where we are currently to there without any intermediate steps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  So you say. I say: putting *any* sort of significantly new social policy
</I>&gt;<i> or sub-system directly into service in the real world without first testing
</I>&gt;<i> and developing it and comparing it extensively &quot;in the laboratory&quot; would be
</I>&gt;<i> foolish, and reasonable people will -- for good reason -- be highly
</I>&gt;<i> unlikely to agree to such a course of action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We now have technologies available that enable us to collaboratively
</I>&gt;<i> create (if we choose) an online Virtual Worlds game/environment, that can
</I>&gt;<i> be as realistic as it needs to be (from the perspective of fully
</I>&gt;<i> implementing, testing, demonstrating, comparing, and popularizing new
</I>&gt;<i> social system visions).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that the possibility exists to create a near-perfect laboratory
</I>&gt;<i> environment within which to test and compare social system visions, I take
</I>&gt;<i> it to be utterly irresponsible for anyone to suggest that *ANY* significant
</I>&gt;<i> social system change be made in the real world without first testing it,
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrating it, and comparing it in that laboratory environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In ThePlan (page 77, as part of the implementation schedule), you express
</I>&gt;<i> one piece of this idea:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Design and implement &quot;virtual world&quot; simulations of The Plan, and test
</I>&gt;<i> them to find exploits and to help refine reasonable Goals and preliminary
</I>&gt;<i> tax rates (i.e., these might be games like SimCity or Second Life, but with
</I>&gt;<i> challenges from the real-world thrown in such as natural and human-caused
</I>&gt;<i> disasters, child-rearing, sickness/accidents/deaths, etc.). Develop and
</I>&gt;<i> test military and international political simulations to help refine
</I>&gt;<i> Planish policies and tactics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  What is missing from this passage is the understanding that the social
</I>&gt;<i> system of The Plan (fully operational and operating in its own virtual
</I>&gt;<i> world) must experimentally prove itself against other bright new visions
</I>&gt;<i> (each also fully operational and operating in its own virtual world), in
</I>&gt;<i> order to legitimately win the hearts and minds of the general public. (We
</I>&gt;<i> are talking science, Baby! The scientific method fully embraces competition
</I>&gt;<i> among competing visions, with those competitions settled on the field of
</I>&gt;<i> actual experimentation, not just on the field of listserv word-wars, Loomio
</I>&gt;<i> votes, or propaganda/advertising campaigns.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, with all of the foregoing as preamble, let us revisit your criticism
</I>&gt;<i> of The Prime Directive, of Blinap, and of Isonomea:

</I>&gt;<i> from where we are currently to there without any intermediate steps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Your hypothesis is that it would/will be &quot;better&quot; (the metrics of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;better&quot; are unspecified) for us (humanity) to take an intermediate step
</I>&gt;<i> first (that is, real-world implementation of ThePlan) and then at some
</I>&gt;<i> unspecified time after that to take further steps (to adopt The Prime
</I>&gt;<i> Directive and implement Blinap/Isonomea, or whatever).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your formulation of the hypothesis omits the possibility of doing all of
</I>&gt;<i> this sort of research (testing these sorts of comparative hypotheses) in
</I>&gt;<i> our virtual worlds laboratory, before taking any steps at all with respect
</I>&gt;<i> to real-world social systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest to you that it is both good science and good engineering to test
</I>&gt;<i> first (in the laboratory), and only *after* thorough comparative testing in
</I>&gt;<i> the laboratory to then propose implementing *anything* in the real world.
