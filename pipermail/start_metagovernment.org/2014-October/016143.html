</I>
Not exactly: Some of them, including political decisionmaking, can be
run in parallel with our existing systems.  But what you say is true
for economic and police/military/social systems.  Those we need to lab
test and run extensive simulations on first.

&gt;<i> We now have technologies available that enable us to collaboratively create
</I>&gt;<i> (if we choose) an online Virtual Worlds game/environment, that can be as
</I>&gt;<i> realistic as it needs to be (from the perspective of fully implementing,
</I>&gt;<i> testing, demonstrating, comparing, and popularizing new social system
</I>&gt;<i> visions).
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> Now that the possibility exists to create a near-perfect laboratory
</I>&gt;<i> environment within which to test and compare social system visions, I take
</I>&gt;<i> it to be utterly irresponsible for anyone to suggest that *ANY* significant
</I>&gt;<i> social system change be made in the real world without first testing it,
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrating it, and comparing it in that laboratory environment.
</I>
Agreed, except that the standard isn't as high for political systems.

&gt;<i> In ThePlan (page 77, as part of the implementation schedule), you express
</I>&gt;<i> one piece of this idea:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Design and implement &#8220;virtual world&#8221; simulations of The Plan, and test them
</I>&gt;<i> to find exploits and to help refine reasonable Goals and preliminary tax
</I>&gt;<i> rates (i.e., these might be games like SimCity or Second Life, but with
</I>&gt;<i> challenges from the real-world thrown in such as natural and human-caused
</I>&gt;<i> disasters, child-rearing, sickness/accidents/deaths, etc.). Develop and test
</I>&gt;<i> military and international political simulations to help refine Planish
</I>&gt;<i> policies and tactics.
</I>
Yup.  The trick is going to be to keep it fun even when shit happens.
Being blinded in an accident or having one of your simkids get cancer
will be quite a different experience from when Godzilla destroys the
city you just created in Sim City.  But to really test the social
support system, some people are going to have to play it in these
modes.

&gt;<i> What is missing from this passage is the understanding that the social
</I>&gt;<i> system of The Plan (fully operational and operating in its own virtual
</I>&gt;<i> world) must experimentally prove itself against other bright new visions
</I>&gt;<i> (each also fully operational and operating in its own virtual world), in
</I>&gt;<i> order to legitimately win the hearts and minds of the general public. (We
</I>&gt;<i> are talking science, Baby! The scientific method fully embraces competition
</I>&gt;<i> among competing visions, with those competitions settled on the field of
</I>&gt;<i> actual experimentation, not just on the field of listserv word-wars, Loomio
</I>&gt;<i> votes, or propaganda/advertising campaigns.)
</I>
Agreed!  I have no problem with an open-source simulation environment
that we can run Blinap vs The Plan on.  I also acknowledge the
possibility that Blinap will work better or even that people will
prefer it.  My prediction, however, is that, because it's a more
advanced but less familiar system that people will find more ways to
game they system in Blinap because we haven't thought of all the ways
it might be used (or misused).

&gt;<i> So, with all of the foregoing as preamble, let us revisit your criticism of
</I>&gt;<i> The Prime Directive, of Blinap, and of Isonomea:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> I like the way this is totally outside the box (doesn't even contain the

</I>&gt;<i> are currently to there without any intermediate steps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your hypothesis is that it would/will be &quot;better&quot; (the metrics of &quot;better&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> are unspecified) for us (humanity) to take an intermediate step first (that
</I>&gt;<i> is, real-world implementation of ThePlan) and then at some unspecified time
</I>&gt;<i> after that to take further steps (to adopt The Prime Directive and implement
</I>&gt;<i> Blinap/Isonomea, or whatever).
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Your formulation of the hypothesis omits the possibility of doing all of
</I>&gt;<i> this sort of research (testing these sorts of comparative hypotheses) in our
</I>&gt;<i> virtual worlds laboratory, before taking any steps at all with respect to
</I>&gt;<i> real-world social systems.
</I>
Umm, you skipped a step there: The Plan includes an explicit migration
path, but I don't see one for Blinap or the Prime Directive except
through something like the Plan that first unifies world government,
thereby making the military issue go away and making the economic
system *much* simpler to tweak.  The Plan's economic and military
systems are really just a few tweaks on our current systems and so
would be relatively easy to integrate with them.  I.e., The Plan will
work fine with just a few Localities and only a few hundred thousand
people, yet will allow interaction with all existing capitalist
economies.  It seems to me a much more difficult problem for Blinap or
the Prime Directive to work well in that intermediate mode.  But once
a unified economic system is in place, those things could much more
easily be adopted (e.g., by industry/domain rather than by Locality,
and with a much more educated and adaptable population than what we
have to work with now).

&gt;<i> I suggest to you that it is both good science and good engineering to test
</I>&gt;<i> first (in the laboratory), and only *after* thorough comparative testing in
</I>&gt;<i> the laboratory to then propose implementing *anything* in the real world.
</I>
Agreed, but this wasn't my point.  My point was just referring to what
the vision statement for Metagovernment should contain.  I don't think
it's necessary for participants in this group to be set on making
major changes to our social and economic systems (as we are), but
merely to be interested in modifying how our political systems work.

    Scott
