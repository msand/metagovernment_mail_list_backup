<PRE>Hi Scott,

 &gt;&gt;&gt;Ned&gt; You seem to be suggesting that we skip this virtual-worlds 
testing and comparing step, and go straight to trying to establish a 
one-world centralized government possessing overwhelming military power 
and full direct control of the global economy, with no virtual-worlds 
testing and comparing at all prior to commencing real-world 
implementation. Really?

 &gt;&gt;Scott&gt; Sort of: We don't have to &quot;virtual world&quot; test the new 
political system because that can be run in parallel with our existing 
systems (i.e., a direct democracy using the same inputs that the 
existing representative governments are getting, but hopefully providing 
different (better) outputs).

     &gt;Ned&gt; For those of us who are privy to only a single real world,
    this &quot;run parallel&quot; plan cannot show us which decision systems are
    &quot;better&quot;. At the point that the two or more decision systems have
    produced their parallel decisions from the same inputs, only one of
    those parallel decisions will be implemented in the real world. All
    of the other parallel decisions will remain untested, so that
    comparing the quality of decision outputs will be impossible.

     &gt;Ned&gt; Scientists do research in laboratories for good reason. The
    real world is exceedingly messy; extraneous factors abound. We can
    learn better and faster through experiments run in controlled
    environments, and through experiments that can be run to completion
    in parallel to allow comparison among results. Implementing parallel
    decisions on parallel virtual worlds would enable this.

 &gt;&gt;Scott&gt; I would assume adoption of the new system would be from small 
(HOAs, school boards, etc.) to large, but even this is not necessary. My 
belief is we could set up a system that would provide better results 
than the US congress relatively easily, for example ;-)

     &gt;Ned&gt; You would be able to show that your alternative decision
    system produced different decisions, but you would not be able to
    show that those different decisions produced &quot;better&quot; results. For
    that, you would need to implement each decision in its own parallel
    virtual world, and then measure and compare the results produced by
    the decisions. (And also, Congress and &quot;Scott's The System&quot; are not
    the only two dogs in the race -- you keep forgetting that. Your main
    competition is not Congress.)

 &gt;&gt;Scott&gt; Working on this part of the problem I think is the purpose of 
metagovernment.org.

     &gt;Ned&gt; I take your parsing of the problem domain to be one of the
    problems *in* that problem domain. You seem to think that
    &quot;government&quot; decision-matters are cleanly distinguishable from
    &quot;economic&quot; decision-matters, from &quot;environmental&quot; decision-matters,
    and so on. Really? If you do think that, please explain the
    distinguishing principles to me. (I would have thought that
    substantive &quot;government&quot; decisions inevitably have economic and
    environmental effects, and that it is precisely through comparing
    those effects that we will be able to select/synthesize our &quot;better
    than Congress&quot; decision system.)

     &gt;Ned&gt; (And also, &quot;metagovernment&quot; means &quot;more than just
    government&quot;, just as &quot;metaphysics&quot; means &quot;more than just physics&quot;.
    It means examining and dealing with the larger/deeper context in
    which the field is embedded. You want &quot;metagovernment.org&quot; to be
    just &quot;government.org&quot;. But perpetuating such &quot;silo thinking&quot; is (I
    suggest) precisely what we do not need at this juncture of human
    history.)

 &gt;&gt;Scott&gt; The Plan and [Isonomea] are much more comprehensive than that, 
though, and in particular I don't see any way to run the *economic* 
system in parallel with our existing systems. Which means those *do* 
need to be extensively simulated and virtual-world tested before people 
should be comfortable that throwing the switch won't cause chaos.

     &gt;Ned&gt; You (correctly) see that &quot;economic decisions&quot; produce effects
    when implemented, and that we need to determine and compare those
    effects in order to make informed choices among alternative economic
    systems. Oddly, you apparently do not see that &quot;government
    decisions&quot; also produce effects when implemented, and that we need
    to determine and compare those effects in order to make informed
    choices among alternative governance systems.

 &gt;&gt;Scott&gt; This is *not* the purpose of metagovernment.org. Maybe 
&quot;metaeconomics.org&quot; or &quot;metacapitalism.org&quot; or something ;-)

     &gt;Ned&gt; Here again is what appears to me to be &quot;silo thinking&quot;. To
    try to punch holes in those silos (to release those trapped), I will
    say this: the term &quot;democratic capitalism&quot; is internally contradictory.

     &gt;Ned&gt; Each and every time that a capitalist or a corporation makes
    a public-matter decision (that is, a decision that will affect not
    just the capitalist or corporation), democracy has been usurped.
     From the perspective of public-matter decision making, democracy
    and capitalism are mutually exclusive alternatives.

     &gt;Ned&gt; Moreover (warm fuzzy fairy tales aside), the most successful
    actual capitalists are generally strongly opposed to democratic
    influences, and will do what they can to neutralize and override
    such influences, particularly with respect to their own plans and
    interests. (I wonder if the most successful capitalists are
    typically SDAs ...)

     &gt;Ned&gt; Bottom Line: Continuing to trust &quot;The Invisible Hand&quot; to make
    public-matter decisions will very likely produce the result that the
    biosphere will be rendered unsuitable for human habitation. (But
    what do we care -- we are not environmentalists, we are only
    concerned with government.)
