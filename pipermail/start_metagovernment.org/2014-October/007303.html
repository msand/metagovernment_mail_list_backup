Good recommendation.  It has an AI as benevolent dictator, but
curiously that doesn't actually *run* the government, what it does is
run an elaborate civil service test (derivative of the Mandarin exam,
I think), the high-scorers getting assigned to various government
positions (one of the sub-plots is that the bad guys figure out how to
cheat and install a president who isn't qualified).  But it's still a
strictly hierarchical system and there's no mention of what happens if
any of these appointed officials turn bad.  There are also lots of
authoritarians (although he doesn't call them that, you can tell from
their behavior) but he makes what I see as a fundamental mistake when
he claims that the difference between the Null-A and these others are
purely the result of education.  Unfortunately as it turns out
authoritarianism is mostly genetic or at least epigenetic (i.e., the
result of the environment affecting gene expression during gestation
and infancy).  You can maybe suppress the most problematic expressions
of it through education and social engineering, but it's always going
to be there in the affected individuals, ready to flare up in a
crisis.

There's also a brief description of a sort of libertarian paradise on
Venus, but not much on how it's actually supposed to work.  Like
libertarians here it just seems that he expects free people to just
magically behave appropriately.  Unfortunately as it turns out, they
don't, and I love this story about Ayn Rand's theories not working out
in the real world:
