Not all science is reductionist.  Not that there's anything *wrong*
with being reductionist unless maybe you're a mystic...

</I>
Yeah, outliers (like those infamous Quakers) are not really useful for
our purposes.

&gt;<i> You basically argue that we are doing engineering and engineering might then

</I>&gt;<i> out there where you can be asciencism  and still get results.
</I>
You maybe have too high a standard for what is science: Building
bridges that fall down *is* science by my definition, at least if you
take any time to try to figure out why they failed.  Engineering is
the phase when you know enough to build bridges that don't fall down.
And while I'd agree that the science of decisionmaking (and perhaps
indeed of all of psychology) is very primitive compared with &quot;hard&quot;
sciences, there is still much to be gained by taking the most robust
findings into consideration in our designs (e.g., Altemeyer, Milgram,
Aronson, Arrow, etc.).  Some of our new bridges will still fall down,
but hopefully what we know about social psychology and political
economics will cut a few years off the time it takes to build our
first usable bridge.

&gt;<i> Anyway putting &quot;set&quot; in quotations confuses me.  We spent 1000 years at
</I>&gt;<i> least getting a good definition and what we have is underneath the math
</I>&gt;<i> axioms which you might think underlies acience which underlies engineering
</I>&gt;<i> which you might think underlies this discussion.
</I>
A randomly-selected group of people is only a &quot;set&quot; in mathematical
sense, and the quotes are because you can't use pure mathematical
tools to predict or control human behavior.  Maybe statistics, but
that's not the kind of math you're referring to...

&gt;<i> On the end point, which text I did suppress, a good goal might be better
</I>&gt;<i> decisions.  So what values of better do you value?
</I>
Being an engineer, efficiency and effectiveness would have to top my
list.  I.e., there has to *be* a decision, it has to be achievable
with a reasonable expenditure of effort, and the resulting policy
would have to be implementable and achieve the desired result.  Note
that including consent/consensus as part of the design works strongly
against the first two, and is although it helps with the third, it
certainly isn't a necessary component.  As I've stated before (and
studies have shown), people will obey a law they don't like and
wouldn't vote for as long as they consider it to be moral.  Our job as
social engineers isn't to make everyone happy or give everyone warm
fuzzy feelings that their input is valued.  We just need to build
systems that are better than those we're currently using which are not
only corrupt and inefficient, but are so unreliable that they put our
very existence as a species at risk.
