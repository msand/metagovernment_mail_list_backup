</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my understanding/experience, generally it works best to work out the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vision first, to the point that one would be able to recognize a coded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instantiation of the vision. Otherwise, one generally winds up throwing
</I>&gt;<i> away
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a whole lot of code. (Even more than &quot;with a vision&quot;.)  (There are others
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who think that visions are a waste of time.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would be me ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At this point, it does not appear to me that there is a common vision
</I>&gt;<i> within
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the community. Which means, at this point there is no shared guidance or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; motivation for coding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.  And as for me I think that's fine: I'm not here to join a
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative development team.  Been there, done that, didn't work
</I>&gt;<i> out all that well.  IMHO it's just not how new ideas get established.
</I>&gt;<i> My experience is that the way it actually happens is that a very small
</I>&gt;<i> development team, perhaps even just one person, codes up a working
</I>&gt;<i> prototype that once it has been shown to be useful *then* gains
</I>&gt;<i> additional developers *very slowly*.  It's very much a case of too
</I>&gt;<i> many cooks spoiling the broth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Until then, my recommendation for the best use of Metagovernment is to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss the underlying philosophy, ideas for how to build these
</I>&gt;<i> systems, and a source of guinea pigs for running the prototypes on.
</I>&gt;<i> The recent runs of Vilfredo I think have been beneficial all around,
</I>&gt;<i> for example, because they not only improve that system but provide all
</I>&gt;<i> of us with information about what we should include (or not include)
</I>&gt;<i> in our own systems.  I.e., even if the output of these runs leaves
</I>&gt;<i> something to be desired (as is my opinion of the new MG home page)
</I>&gt;<i> it's still worth doing because of these secondary benefits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The particular project that we have been discussing on this thread (an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on-line open-source Virtual Worlds Social Systems Laboratory) is huge,
</I>&gt;<i> as in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;land a human on the moon&quot; huge. But, if we had the $160 billion that
</I>&gt;<i> Apple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is sitting on, we could probably get it up and running in a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> years
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and thereby maybe Save The World). (If anybody knows somebody at Apple
</I>&gt;<i> ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may be right, but then again, there have been a great many
</I>&gt;<i> examples where such projects have been complete disasters.  I was just
</I>&gt;<i> at DIA a few days ago picking up my wife and I asked one of the
</I>&gt;<i> information people about the automated baggage system that they spent
</I>&gt;<i> half a billion dollars on but end up scrapping after a couple of years
</I>&gt;<i> because it just wasn't reliable enough and was costing more to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain than it would cost to do it manually.  And here it is 20
</I>&gt;<i> years later and they're still handling baggage manually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think our best bet will be to adapt some existing (or soon to be
</I>&gt;<i> released) system, which is something a small team could do.  When the
</I>&gt;<i> time comes...
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
