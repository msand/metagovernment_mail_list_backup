<PRE>Do you remember this discussion ?.
I had a funny idea and I created a method, that might have solved it. We 
may use it next time, if you like it.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Deciding_how_to_decide">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Deciding_how_to_decide</A>

Now, I will be working on the concept that is described in the recent 
discussion with Max. I hope it caught your attention and I invite 
everybody to comment on it.

Kind regards
Michael

</I>&gt;<i>             Wow!
</I>&gt;<i>             a lot of interesting observation from Scott and from
</I>&gt;<i>             Pietro, unfortunately I cannot decipher Max entry due to
</I>&gt;<i>             too many subjective (metaphorical?) examples, I really can't!
</I>&gt;<i>             But the analysis by Scott is deep and i catch some insight
</I>&gt;<i>             that was put by parenthesis....
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;(none of us are trying to game this Home Page decision,
</I>&gt;<i>             are we?)&quot; This is something I had sensed too.
</I>&gt;<i>             I believe we agreed on a Condorcet ranking method and
</I>&gt;<i>             there is a lot of them out there, that is not the issue,
</I>&gt;<i>             in Airesis we use Schulze that is a Condorcet variation
</I>&gt;<i>             that bring a unambiguous decision.
</I>&gt;<i>             But the problem is not the voting method that by slight
</I>&gt;<i>             differences may bring the same result.
</I>&gt;<i>             The problem rely on the construction method, how or like
</I>&gt;<i>             Pietro say HOW we build the outcome of the proposal... in
</I>&gt;<i>             our case the text of the metagovernment home page! This is
</I>&gt;<i>             the Graal or Holy Grail of consensus building. In that
</I>&gt;<i>             sense I believe that Vilfredo did a great job because we
</I>&gt;<i>             patiently use it enough to read trough all the
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;mutations&quot;, for this I think that Vilfredo will be better
</I>&gt;<i>             to build shorter sentences! Regarding Airesis, as I say
</I>&gt;<i>             before I will not guide you through an Airesis proposal, I
</I>&gt;<i>             know is working fine and more than a thousand people are
</I>&gt;<i>             using it on a monthly basis to decide the rules in their
</I>&gt;<i>             groups and take decisions. When the group will be ready to
</I>&gt;<i>             try it, it will. I suggest who ever try it to take screen
</I>&gt;<i>             shot of the wizard guided process to show the decision
</I>&gt;<i>             that must be addressed BEFORE opening a proposal. Another
</I>&gt;<i>             way is to decide them previously and whoever open the
</I>&gt;<i>             proposal follow the agreed quorums. Regardless if you do
</I>&gt;<i>             not test the platform you'll never know how it works. I
</I>&gt;<i>             will ask to some of my colleague to join the group as
</I>&gt;<i>             observer and facilitator once the first proposal is started.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Will be Simone Curini, Nicola Giulietti, Carlo Mion and
</I>&gt;<i>             Alessandro Rodi all of them have good English knowledge
</I>&gt;<i>             and are deeply involved in the Airesis project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             CC Simone, Nicola, Carlo and Alessandro
</I>&gt;<i>             Regards
</I>&gt;<i>             Jacopo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             PS the result of the test in Airesis will NOT be binding,
</I>&gt;<i>             at least we can relax and concentrate on the construction
</I>&gt;<i>             method.

</I>&gt;<i>                     vote.  Which puzzles me.  I've read thousands of
</I>&gt;<i>                     pages of the research in this area over the last
</I>&gt;<i>                     few months and yet never came across a single case
</I>&gt;<i>                     like we have here where people insist on voting on

</I>&gt;<i>                     fundamentally alter the decisionmaking process.
</I>&gt;<i>                      Indeed, I'd be willing to bet that we'd come up
</I>&gt;<i>                     with the same decision voting on each proposal
</I>&gt;<i>                     separately on Loomio and just picking the one with
</I>&gt;<i>                     the most yes votes.  Especially considering the
</I>&gt;<i>                     main benefit of these other voting algorithms is
</I>&gt;<i>                     to thwart people trying to game the system by
</I>&gt;<i>                     appealing to a subset of the voters and relying on
</I>&gt;<i>                     &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; to deal with the rest
</I>&gt;<i>                     (none of us are trying to game this Home Page
</I>&gt;<i>                     decision, are we?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                     Since none of them will deign to explain the
</I>&gt;<i>                     justification for their behavior I have very
</I>&gt;<i>                     little to go on, but my gut tells me that the main
</I>&gt;<i>                     problem is still the fantasy about collaborative
</I>&gt;<i>                     government and consensus, disagreement about which
</I>&gt;<i>                     is the very reason why the Home page was taken
</I>&gt;<i>                     down.  It also explains why Loomio gets such short
</I>&gt;<i>                     shrift because it just doesn't even claim to
</I>&gt;<i>                     support either even though it would work fine
</I>&gt;<i>                     (albeit somewhat inefficiently) for any decision
</I>&gt;<i>                     we have to make.  As I see it our main problem is
</I>&gt;<i>                     not choosing a voting method, it's that members of
</I>&gt;<i>                     this group can't even agree on what it means to
</I>&gt;<i>                     make a group decision.  A secondary problem being
</I>&gt;<i>                     that those members who insist on
</I>&gt;<i>                     collaboration/consensus *also* refuse to debate
</I>&gt;<i>                     that issue (e.g., *why* isn't a vote on Loomio
</I>&gt;<i>                     binding?) or indeed the issue of whether or not
</I>&gt;<i>                     the old decision rule (80% majority according to
</I>&gt;<i>                     Ed) is even still in effect.  Propose all the
</I>&gt;<i>                     clever things you want, but if you're not willing
</I>&gt;<i>                     to face the facts about human behavior (even *our*
</I>&gt;<i>                     behavior) this group will continue to shed members
</I>&gt;<i>                     who actually value getting things done over
</I>&gt;<i>                     handwaving, in which case we might as well ask Ed
</I>&gt;<i>                     to just take down the site and sell the domain to
</I>&gt;<i>                     somebody who actually wants to use it for
</I>&gt;<i>                     something productive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                     As for Airesis, I'm willing to give that a try,
</I>&gt;<i>                     but as I told Jacopo previously, it didn't seem to
</I>&gt;<i>                     be working correctly last time I tried it, and the
</I>&gt;<i>                     language barrier goes both ways (certainly his
</I>&gt;<i>                     English is vastly superior to my Italian!)  If he
</I>&gt;<i>                     wants to run a full beta-test of the software,
</I>&gt;<i>                     count me in, but *he* will have to organize it and
</I>&gt;<i>                     lead us through the process or it just isn't going
</I>&gt;<i>                     to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                     Another proposal: It occurs to me that another one

</I>&gt;<i>                     we seem to be expecting some fancy new software to
</I>&gt;<i>                     magically reach inside each of our brains and
</I>&gt;<i>                     extract (or worse, manufacture) consensus.  Ain't

</I>&gt;<i>                     involved now we could collaboratively design the

</I>&gt;<i>                     vote.  If you agree, please post your list and
</I>&gt;<i>                     I'll volunteer to integrate with the understanding

</I>&gt;<i>                     therefore have a mandate to make a binding
</I>&gt;<i>                     decision without them.  The only remaining issue
</I>&gt;<i>                     would be to establish quorum, which I'd propose to
</I>&gt;<i>                     use a majority of the people who have posted to
</I>&gt;<i>                     the list in the last 2 months (since the Home Page
