<PRE>Thank you Ben, likewise up to the goosebumps I felt on my skin :-), We are
expecting to meet soon with Pia Martini and some other member of
DemocracyOS so I believe that there is real merging energy of the different
group toward setting the standard for democracy platform interoperability,
lets keep this goal up in our priority. I will add in CC Felipe Munoz,
Stefano Stortone (author of a PB platform)  and my friends from
Metagovernment, this may serve to establish 3 way or even more group
coordination.  We are making history!
Kind Regards
Jacopo

&gt;<i> Jacopo, wonderful to talk with you today - it's always great to connect

</I>&gt;<i> Your notes look like an excellent encapsulation of the discussion -
</I>&gt;<i> nothing to add from my end.

</I>&gt;<i> Look forward to moving forward together!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had the privilege to meet Benjamin today the 11th of October 2014 via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hangouts and discuss the potential collaboration between the two platform.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each of us represented the reference projects in the best interest of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world not of the related project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There was a brief presentation of each projects and the values that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> share and we had a complete match on the values.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We both agree that there is no silver bullet for the realization of a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We share the same common denominator of the necessity of extended or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> total interoperability of the platform.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With surprise we realize that we are both discussing with DemocracyOS the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need for interoperability, Benjamin mention also that they are seeking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaboration with other platform and I ask him to list them here and to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which extent.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ( I close the windows and lost the note we share in the chat!!)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Benjamin meet with Pietro Speroni and with Giovanni Allegretti and we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> share the same idea on the need of a participatory budgeting module, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mention the module architecture we are seeking to deliver and the vision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was shared.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Both platform are developed in Ruby and both platform are released in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AGPL3.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Loomio that is released in beta will officially release a final version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in November.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Airesis is in the testing phase of the 4.0 version that will be released
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when our testing will be completed and the platform sufficiently stable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While Airesis is developed by us as a full platform, Loomio is considered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more as a module in a framework.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Loomio team is definitely better in collecting funds, in contrast our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political situation is definitely worst, I mention how the M5S have twisted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the direct participation into a closed platform, while NZ i definitely a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better place for this kind of development.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I mention the structure of Tecnologie Democratiche Association and I did
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not ask how they are structured.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The development process of the two platform is decided in the respective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform in an identical way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Benjamin and I agreed to bring the discussion further in the direction of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the development of Open API and we agree that as soon as any of the group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> produce a quality document in this regard we should share the knowledge and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  establish direct analyst and programmer communication in order to further
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explore and implement interoperability. At this time both head developers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are completely absorbed by their  internal tasks and we identified end of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> November early December as the best time to reopen discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My final judgment of the meeting is an A+ or in our standard a 10 e lode.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I ask Benjamin to comment on this report, add as pleased and disclose the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full report to the Airesis and Loomio mailing list. (Benjamin you can send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it to me and I will publish in our ML)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Most Kind Regards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jacopo
