<PRE>Hi Scott,
what experience do you have about sociocracy? And I mean direct real
experience?
Were you ever inside an organization using it? Was everybody trained into
using it? Did you read a book? A pamphlet? The wikipedia page?

I am making no mistery of where do I stand in terms of experience. Can you
be so transparent as well?

</I>&gt;<i> (big snip, nice description of how it works)

</I>
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE: IF YOU DON'T KNOW SOCIOCRACY READ MY DESCRIPTION ABOVE,
PLEASE


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now that I have explained how the process of simple decision making works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let me explain why I consider this method superior to any other method I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have seen so far (I exclude Vilfredo which is pretty similar). Objections
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are considered. No one can have a proposal been chucked up his throat. On
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the other side this veto power can only be used for reasonable reasons.
</I>&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is important that any personal mythology, belief system, unreasonable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assumptions, personal biases, are either suspended. Or somehow made
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; explicit, and a person accepts not to act based on it. Apparently to do
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people need to be at a certain level of maturity
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And here it is, the second major flaw in sociocracy:
</I>


&gt;<i> An expectation
</I>&gt;<i> that people will behave reasonably
</I>

True! I agree this is a flaw, but it works. And I cannot see how ANY system
could work without having this expectation AND not being an autocracy of
some kind.
And matter of fact, it does work. But also it does require some training
from the participants.


&gt;<i> and that there is a moderator
</I>&gt;<i> available to help them &quot;see&quot; the flaws in their reasoning.
</I>

False! Moderators (which are only called facilitator for a reason) do NOT
help you see through flaws in your reasoning. They only make sure we, as a
circle, follow the correct procedure (now there is this phase, now there is
that phase). I do not have enough experience to know what facilitators do
when people start to act unreasonable (we all have done it), maybe Gustav
could chip in here. Maybe they just need to be trained enough to spot it
and adjourn the session when everybody is more relaxed and less stressed
out.


&gt;<i> This is
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the same problem that I mentioned before is causing such
</I>&gt;<i> problems on that German Pirate Party list: There are certain members
</I>&gt;<i> of that development team who are apparently *obsessed* with the idea
</I>&gt;<i> that a moderator will step in and &quot;correct&quot; behavior that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> comply with some standard.
</I>
And the list of possible violations is
&gt;<i> quite extensive.  One of the favorite targets is the &quot;killer phrase&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> or &quot;killer argument&quot; (Totschlagargumente, which Google comically
</I>&gt;<i> translates as &quot;manslaughter argument&quot;).  Unfortunately Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> inexplicably doesn't have an English description for this concept (the
</I>&gt;<i> link to &quot;thought terminating cliche&quot; isn't really right), but you can
</I>&gt;<i> get a good idea by running Google translate on the German page:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totschlagargument">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totschlagargument</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My main problem with the German team's obsession with correcting this
</I>&gt;<i> behavior (through censure) is that it gives extraordinary power to the
</I>&gt;<i> moderators,
</I>

Sorry, but facilitators in sociocracy do NOT have this power. I think you
are projecting based upon limited information and no real experience.

but also imposes a huge burden on them (a system based on
&gt;<i> this would make the East German Stasi look like a model of efficiency
</I>&gt;<i> by comparison ;-)
</I>

What I saw was very efficient, lean and effective.


&gt;<i> But it's also a major burden on everyone else who
</I>&gt;<i> has to just sit and watch this process because it's just a waste of
</I>&gt;<i> their time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, this was not my experience. There was a bit of a learning curve, but
eventually it seemed to run smoothly.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also it is VERY important to note that there is no time where people
</I>&gt;<i> vote if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they &#8220;like&#8221; a proposal. No counting of the votes. If you like a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not is irrelevant. The only thing relevant is: &#8220;do you have reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objections to it&#8221; that shows how it would hinder us or not help us in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reaching our aim. As such all the neutral people, and also people that
</I>&gt;<i> might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not like a proposal still will not stop it. This is VERY powerful, as in
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; step sidesteps all the majority versus minority elements of voting
</I>&gt;<i> theory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also removes the incredibly powerful force of *competition* as a
</I>&gt;<i> tool to shape a solution.
</I>

Agreed. Which is why I think Vilfredo is potentially more powerful. Also &quot;I
think&quot; there is nothing in classic sociocracy to stop someone to work on an
alternative solution, or to have more than one being developed. You just
need to have a policy to decide how to handle them.



&gt;<i> In which case you end up with something
</I>&gt;<i> like the new MG home page, weak and probably completely ineffective
</I>&gt;<i> for its main purpose of recruiting new members.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Vilfredo versus Sociocracy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;...Thus Vilfredo is inherently parallel, while
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sociocratic discussion is linear (or circular).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And as a result inherently inefficient because everyone has to sit and
</I>&gt;<i> listen to everyone else's debates rather than just being able to read
</I>&gt;<i> a digest (e.g., the top rated 2 or 3 comments: As you can probably
</I>&gt;<i> tell, I hate meetings and consider them an archaic tradition).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Let me guess, you never tried Sociocracy. And by tried I mean with people
really trained in using it.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question about sociocracy implementations: All the examples I've seen
</I>&gt;<i> assume people sitting in a room.  Is there an electronic
</I>&gt;<i> implementation?
</I>

Not yet, that I know off. Vilfredo was very well received when I presented
it, and it might merge through some API with some other sociocratic
software being under development.



&gt;<i> How does moderation work in that context?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If Vilfredo was to be the system,  it would be an AI.
