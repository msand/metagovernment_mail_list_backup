<PRE>Wonderful to news Jacopo, Ben, and others. Exciting times ahead.  :)
Good luck with the budgeting module.  I&#8217;m curious what you imagine this will look like&#8230;..?

&gt;<i> Thank you Ben, likewise up to the goosebumps I felt on my skin :-), We are expecting to meet soon with Pia Martini and some other member of DemocracyOS so I believe that there is real merging energy of the different group toward setting the standard for democracy platform interoperability, lets keep this goal up in our priority. I will add in CC Felipe Munoz, Stefano Stortone (author of a PB platform)  and my friends from Metagovernment, this may serve to establish 3 way or even more group coordination.  We are making history!
</I>&gt;<i> Kind Regards

</I>&gt;<i> Jacopo, wonderful to talk with you today - it's always great to connect with likeminded people working toward the same goal.

</I>&gt;<i> Your notes look like an excellent encapsulation of the discussion - nothing to add from my end. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Look forward to moving forward together!

</I>&gt;<i> I had the privilege to meet Benjamin today the 11th of October 2014 via Hangouts and discuss the potential collaboration between the two platform. 
</I>&gt;<i> Each of us represented the reference projects in the best interest of the world not of the related project.
</I>&gt;<i> There was a brief presentation of each projects and the values that we share and we had a complete match on the values.
</I>&gt;<i> We both agree that there is no silver bullet for the realization of a new governance.
</I>&gt;<i> We share the same common denominator of the necessity of extended or total interoperability of the platform.
</I>&gt;<i> With surprise we realize that we are both discussing with DemocracyOS the need for interoperability, Benjamin mention also that they are seeking collaboration with other platform and I ask him to list them here and to which extent.
</I>&gt;<i> ( I close the windows and lost the note we share in the chat!!)
</I>&gt;<i> Benjamin meet with Pietro Speroni and with Giovanni Allegretti and we share the same idea on the need of a participatory budgeting module, I mention the module architecture we are seeking to deliver and the vision was shared.
</I>&gt;<i> Both platform are developed in Ruby and both platform are released in AGPL3.
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio that is released in beta will officially release a final version in November.
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis is in the testing phase of the 4.0 version that will be released when our testing will be completed and the platform sufficiently stable.
</I>&gt;<i> While Airesis is developed by us as a full platform, Loomio is considered more as a module in a framework.
</I>&gt;<i> The Loomio team is definitely better in collecting funds, in contrast our political situation is definitely worst, I mention how the M5S have twisted the direct participation into a closed platform, while NZ i definitely a better place for this kind of development.
</I>&gt;<i> I mention the structure of Tecnologie Democratiche Association and I did not ask how they are structured.
</I>&gt;<i> The development process of the two platform is decided in the respective platform in an identical way.
</I>&gt;<i> Benjamin and I agreed to bring the discussion further in the direction of the development of Open API and we agree that as soon as any of the group produce a quality document in this regard we should share the knowledge and  establish direct analyst and programmer communication in order to further explore and implement interoperability. At this time both head developers are completely absorbed by their  internal tasks and we identified end of November early December as the best time to reopen discussion
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My final judgment of the meeting is an A+ or in our standard a 10 e lode.
</I>&gt;<i> I ask Benjamin to comment on this report, add as pleased and disclose the full report to the Airesis and Loomio mailing list. (Benjamin you can send it to me and I will publish in our ML)
</I>&gt;<i> Most Kind Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Jacopo
