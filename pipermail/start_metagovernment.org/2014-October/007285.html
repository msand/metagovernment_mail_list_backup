<PRE>Hi all,

After the online meeting and being on the list for a while I have some
thoughts about Metagovernment as a whole. I will start with the conclusion
and then put how I got their after.

I propose this as the mission statement of metagovenment.

&quot;&quot;&quot;
To provide a neutral forum where individuals and organisations can come
together and discuss how they can better apply open governance to their
situation.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all what I think we all agree.

 -   There is a better way to do open government that hasn't been thought
of yet.

Then, what we disagree.

  -  How to implement and what this government is.

Lastly, why this makes sense.

  -  We all come from different situations and motives.

For me I think this is great system because if you go back to the first
part it &quot;hasn't been thought of yet&quot;. A thread running right now about
Sociocracy brought up the fact that we should be adapting the system to the
people not the people to the system. Putting aside wether we agree with
that statement or not it made me think of a similar statement.

'''
The governing model should fit the situation. We should not fit the
situation to the governing model.
'''

While I don't think this is a hard rule to follow I do believe that one
system may benefit or need different forms of open government than another.
Someday we come up with the &quot;grand theory of everything&quot; but until then we
only have what we have. What we have are people or organisations pioneering
the use of open governance in the situation they are in. With that in mind
I came up with definition I would like to propose.

&quot;&quot;&quot;
To provide a neutral forum where individuals and organisations can come
together and discuss how they can better apply open governance to their
situation.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

I believe this can help us frame our discussion not around what is right
and wrong in a global sense, but what is right and wrong for each person
and goal that comes to the list. It is inviting to others when we say,
&quot;come to us and we can help you with your idea or passion&quot;. Instead of,
&quot;come to us and we will tell you what to do&quot;.

Thoughts?

Cheers,
James
