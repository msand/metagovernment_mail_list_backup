<PRE>Thanks for the responses Scott. I concede my arguments for the flat tax,
there are faults with it that I did not fully consider. I was merely
looking at it from a simplicity standpoint.



I also agree with your statement that we need to design the system around
the presumption that people are primarily out for themselves, that people
will will not support something unless it benefits them or their loved
ones. However I believe that this is where active discussion can come in to
resolve any issue. Before anything goes to a vote it is first put through
a debate forum, where the individual presents the idea that they think has
the best chance of being passed. They pander to the room, rationalizing why
the rest of the population should support their idea, giving incentive for
others to get on board. In this way the temperature of the room is taken
and we get a sense of how the public feels about the proposal before it
goes to a vote. This gives a chance for opposing views to voice their
opinions as to why they are against the idea, suggestions as to how they
might gain support for the idea can be presented and incorporated into the
proposal.



Using the road example again. The corn farmer says he wants new roads to
help him do business with the city more effectively, he does his research
and says new roads will save so many gallons of petrol per year
and reduce the amount of wear on vehicles that cost so many dollars to
repair every year. He budgets the money that this will save him at
$2000 annually. Most people say fine but what's in it for them? The corn
farmer can then come in and say &quot;if the project goes through he'll be able
to cut 5 cents off every dozen ears of corn he sells, bringing the price to
$8.35 a dozen&quot;. This provides a meaningful incentive for people to support
the project, they get something out of it. It's important to have these
long nuanced conversations to fully explore each idea and get everyone's
opinions out in the open, then we can work on compromises. Once everyone's
had their say, all valid criticism has been addressed and there isn't any
significant opposition to the idea, then it goes to a vote.



Everything is connected in one way or another and if the dots are able to
be connected in a way that people realize that a project does in fact have
benefits for them as well, they'll support it, or at least not oppose it.
Again, the annual budget has to be spent on something. At each level every
project is only allowed to be a certain amount of the total annual budget,
this ensures that many projects are passed throughout the year and that
only the most logical ones that are proven to support the largest amount of
population go through.



If there's even a small benefit that people can rationalize with no
negative consequences then they shouldn't have a problem supporting it
right?



I think it's important to encourage co-operation where ever possible, to
try and get over this idea that it's us versus them. I believe this system
helps bridge the gaps and bring people together in a meaningful way.
Looking forward to your response.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; manifesting that relationship.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well the rural wouldn't really be able to influence the city to much
</I>&gt;<i> because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they would have much lower numbers. Conversely say a farmer wanted a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; road to help him do business. I don't see the city particularly having a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem with it, because it's not a giant project. Hopefully people would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recognize the connection between the farm and getting food in the city
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to help this process. There's not much benefit to voting against it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's not like your getting extra money if you vote no, the project money
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will just be spent else where.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is just not how it plays out in my experience.  Here in Boulder
</I>&gt;<i> we're going through *exactly* this scenario with roads in the County,
</I>&gt;<i> which the County government is trying not to pay for rebuilding.  They
</I>&gt;<i> want the rural subdivision residents to pay, and even passed a law
</I>&gt;<i> imposing a special tax on them to do so.  But the rural residents
</I>&gt;<i> filed a lawsuit that the County lost and so had to reimburse millions
</I>&gt;<i> of dollars that they'd already collected.  And we still don't know
</I>&gt;<i> who's going to pay to fix those roads because the County spent all
</I>&gt;<i> that money on other things (mostly social services and some purchases
</I>&gt;<i> of open space).  The County people rightly claim that they pay sales
</I>&gt;<i> taxes to the various cities (because that's where all the businesses
</I>&gt;<i> are) who use that money not to improve all roads, but only the roads
</I>&gt;<i> in the City.  This kind of stuff happens constantly here, not just
</I>&gt;<i> with roads, but with school districts, mining rights (fracking is big
</I>&gt;<i> here), and water projects.  Any time you have multiple overlapping
</I>&gt;<i> jurisdictions there is great inefficiency in the system because
</I>&gt;<i> everyone just points fingers at the other guy and it takes expensive
</I>&gt;<i> and timeconsuming lawsuits to come up with a solution (lawsuits, I
</I>&gt;<i> must point out, that the lawyers who are the people primarily making
</I>&gt;<i> these laws in the first place, all benefit from).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my system only has two levels, Locality and Globality to avoid all
</I>&gt;<i> this inefficiency.  I've read many proposals with only the Local
</I>&gt;<i> level, but IMHO there has to be at least two levels because there has
</I>&gt;<i> to be an authority to coordinate projects between Localities and there
</I>&gt;<i> are some things (like defense, monetary system, and natural monopolies
</I>&gt;<i> like health care insurance) that are just too inefficient to run
</I>&gt;<i> separately at the local level.  States and Counties go away, and good
</I>&gt;<i> riddance: I've read various sets of statutes at those two levels and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not really completely sure why, but the quality of the codes at
</I>&gt;<i> those levels is just inferior to that even at local levels, at least
</I>&gt;<i> for cities above about 100K or so population.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, again, &quot;hoping&quot; that people will vote to support the common
</I>&gt;<i> interest is just naive and represents a fundamental misunderstanding
</I>&gt;<i> of human nature.  There is actually a very limited amount of altruism
</I>&gt;<i> like this available and if you design your system without accounting
</I>&gt;<i> for that parameter it'll either just fail (if you assume too much) or
</I>&gt;<i> be suboptimal (if you assume too little).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
