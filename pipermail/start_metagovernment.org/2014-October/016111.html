<PRE>Please, who want to use Vilfredo, use it. Who wants to post his opinion 
in mailing list, do so.
I will try to put it together than.

Just please express you opinion or vote and let us do, what we want to 
do. We want to create a community portal and you will be always able 
discuss these ideas there or one moment later here.

Is here somebody who is entirely against
&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to map and support the 
development of tools and projects for democratization of global 
governance.&quot; ?

Kind regards
MIchael

</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I think the answer is yes.  But you'll get a chance to
</I>&gt;<i> fix this by adding your own proposal in the next round.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But this brings up what I think is a design flaw in the current
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo: The lack of a measure of *effectiveness* of the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> All it seems to currently do is have people assess the *accuracy* of
</I>&gt;<i> the proposals with the result being that there is a strong force
</I>&gt;<i> applied to weaken them as much possible to avoid setting off anyone's
</I>&gt;<i> BS detector.  The result is like the new MG Home page, something
</I>&gt;<i> that's technically accurate but completely ineffective for its
</I>&gt;<i> (assumed) purpose.  In a Chinese philosophy sense, it's all &quot;yin&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> no &quot;yang&quot;.  There needs to be an opposing (or complementary, if you're
</I>&gt;<i> a Taoist) force that would work to make the statements stronger and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore more effective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been trying to think of how this would work and have a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) There needs to be some &quot;goal&quot; specified along with the original
</I>&gt;<i> question: How are we going to assess whether the output of the process
</I>&gt;<i> is a success or not?  In the case of the Home page, I would have
</I>&gt;<i> assumed it is primarily supposed to be a recruiting tool, to get
</I>&gt;<i> people to read the rest of the site and join the mailing list.  In one
</I>&gt;<i> sense the &quot;real world&quot; can be counted on to provide this feedback, but
</I>&gt;<i> that's too inefficient: By the time that feedback arrives the
</I>&gt;<i> organization may be dead (e.g., if some company used Vilfredo to
</I>&gt;<i> determine a feature list for their product or a marketing plan, they
</I>&gt;<i> need to know it will work *before* they launch because that is a
</I>&gt;<i> bet-the-company decision).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) There needs to be two types of feedback, one on accuracy one on
</I>&gt;<i> effectiveness.  While I'm still more a &quot;ratings&quot; rather than &quot;yes/no&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> kind of guy, I think you can do it with a simple measure of whether
</I>&gt;<i> the participant believes the proposal would meet the goal or not.  Not
</I>&gt;<i> sure how to integrate these two measures (e.g., combine at each phase,
</I>&gt;<i> run parallel Pareto fronts, or wait until the end when the integration
</I>&gt;<i> and final vote occurs), but fortunately it's not my project so I don't
</I>&gt;<i> have to run the experiments to see which works best ;-)
