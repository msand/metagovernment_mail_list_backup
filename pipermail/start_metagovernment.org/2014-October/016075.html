(big snip, nice description of how it works)

&gt;<i> Now that I have explained how the process of simple decision making works
</I>&gt;<i> let me explain why I consider this method superior to any other method I
</I>&gt;<i> have seen so far (I exclude Vilfredo which is pretty similar). Objections
</I>&gt;<i> are considered. No one can have a proposal been chucked up his throat. On
</I>&gt;<i> the other side this veto power can only be used for reasonable reasons. It
</I>&gt;<i> is important that any personal mythology, belief system, unreasonable
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions, personal biases, are either suspended. Or somehow made
</I>&gt;<i> explicit, and a person accepts not to act based on it. Apparently to do this
</I>&gt;<i> people need to be at a certain level of maturity
</I>
And here it is, the second major flaw in sociocracy: An expectation
that people will behave reasonably and that there is a moderator
available to help them &quot;see&quot; the flaws in their reasoning.  This is
exactly the same problem that I mentioned before is causing such
problems on that German Pirate Party list: There are certain members
of that development team who are apparently *obsessed* with the idea
that a moderator will step in and &quot;correct&quot; behavior that doesn't
comply with some standard.  And the list of possible violations is
quite extensive.  One of the favorite targets is the &quot;killer phrase&quot;
or &quot;killer argument&quot; (Totschlagargumente, which Google comically
translates as &quot;manslaughter argument&quot;).  Unfortunately Wikipedia
inexplicably doesn't have an English description for this concept (the
link to &quot;thought terminating cliche&quot; isn't really right), but you can
get a good idea by running Google translate on the German page:
 <A HREF="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totschlagargument">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totschlagargument</A>

My main problem with the German team's obsession with correcting this
behavior (through censure) is that it gives extraordinary power to the
moderators, but also imposes a huge burden on them (a system based on
this would make the East German Stasi look like a model of efficiency
by comparison ;-)  But it's also a major burden on everyone else who
has to just sit and watch this process because it's just a waste of
their time.

&gt;<i> Also it is VERY important to note that there is no time where people vote if
</I>&gt;<i> they &#8220;like&#8221; a proposal. No counting of the votes. If you like a proposal or
</I>&gt;<i> not is irrelevant. The only thing relevant is: &#8220;do you have reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> objections to it&#8221; that shows how it would hinder us or not help us in
</I>&gt;<i> reaching our aim. As such all the neutral people, and also people that might
</I>&gt;<i> not like a proposal still will not stop it. This is VERY powerful, as in one
</I>&gt;<i> step sidesteps all the majority versus minority elements of voting theory.
</I>
And also removes the incredibly powerful force of *competition* as a
tool to shape a solution.  In which case you end up with something
like the new MG home page, weak and probably completely ineffective
for its main purpose of recruiting new members.

&gt;<i> Vilfredo versus Sociocracy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>...Thus Vilfredo is inherently parallel, while
</I>&gt;<i> Sociocratic discussion is linear (or circular).
</I>
And as a result inherently inefficient because everyone has to sit and
listen to everyone else's debates rather than just being able to read
a digest (e.g., the top rated 2 or 3 comments: As you can probably
tell, I hate meetings and consider them an archaic tradition).

Question about sociocracy implementations: All the examples I've seen
assume people sitting in a room.  Is there an electronic
implementation?  How does moderation work in that context?
  Regards,
     Scott
