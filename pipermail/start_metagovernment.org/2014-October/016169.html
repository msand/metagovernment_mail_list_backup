That would be me ;-)

Agreed.  And as for me I think that's fine: I'm not here to join a
collaborative development team.  Been there, done that, didn't work
out all that well.  IMHO it's just not how new ideas get established.
My experience is that the way it actually happens is that a very small
development team, perhaps even just one person, codes up a working
prototype that once it has been shown to be useful *then* gains
additional developers *very slowly*.  It's very much a case of too
many cooks spoiling the broth.

Until then, my recommendation for the best use of Metagovernment is to
discuss the underlying philosophy, ideas for how to build these
systems, and a source of guinea pigs for running the prototypes on.
The recent runs of Vilfredo I think have been beneficial all around,
for example, because they not only improve that system but provide all
of us with information about what we should include (or not include)
in our own systems.  I.e., even if the output of these runs leaves
something to be desired (as is my opinion of the new MG home page)
it's still worth doing because of these secondary benefits.

&gt;<i> The particular project that we have been discussing on this thread (an
</I>&gt;<i> on-line open-source Virtual Worlds Social Systems Laboratory) is huge, as in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;land a human on the moon&quot; huge. But, if we had the $160 billion that Apple
</I>&gt;<i> is sitting on, we could probably get it up and running in a couple of years
</I>&gt;<i> (and thereby maybe Save The World). (If anybody knows somebody at Apple ...)
</I>
You may be right, but then again, there have been a great many
examples where such projects have been complete disasters.  I was just
at DIA a few days ago picking up my wife and I asked one of the
information people about the automated baggage system that they spent
half a billion dollars on but end up scrapping after a couple of years
because it just wasn't reliable enough and was costing more to
maintain than it would cost to do it manually.  And here it is 20
years later and they're still handling baggage manually.

I think our best bet will be to adapt some existing (or soon to be
released) system, which is something a small team could do.  When the
time comes...
  Regards,
    Scott
