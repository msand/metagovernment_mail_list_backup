Not crazy about the name: It sounds to me like &quot;government by the
sexiest&quot; (i.e., Eros/Erotic&quot; as the root)

Also not crazy about the concept.  Do the representatives have to take
the test before each vote to ensure they are qualified to make
decisions in that domain?  It also seems to me an open invitation for
authoritarians to take over: Remember, authoritarians (and social
dominators) are the people who *want* to do this job and are willing
to jump through hoops to get it.  Unfortunately once they get into
power, their innate prejudices and obsolete moral codes lead them to
start wars and commit horrible acts against their own people.  Unless
your system includes a way to either screen them out or draft enough
neurotypicals to outvote them, it'll end up being no better than our
current representative governments (i.e., our systems fail not because
the representatives are unskilled or uneducated, it's because they're
easily corruptible and the system is designed in such a way to allow
special interests to exploit this characteristic).

Speaking of which, as part of my utopias/dystopias survey I recently
finished HG Wells' &quot;A Modern Utopia&quot;.  The leaders in that system are
called &quot;Samurai&quot; and they are self-selected: Nobody votes them into
(or out of) office, they just have to follow &quot;The Rule&quot; to demonstrate
that they're qualified.  &quot;The Rule&quot; being a very odd set of criteria
including being required to take cold showers, wear special clothes,
be teetotalers, and avoid any occupation that involves buying or
selling things.  It wasn't exactly clear to me what any of these
things had to do with being good at government, and worse, these are
exactly the kind of arbitrary rules that Authoritarians would be happy
to follow but the neurotypicals would not (i.e., it's exactly the
opposite of what *I* claim is the way to ensure good government).  It
also didn't seem very &quot;Utopian&quot; to me: There are no pets, there seemed
to be very few fun things to do, and the jail system sounded just like
the one in the movie &quot;Escape from New York&quot;.  Now I'm on to &quot;Looking
Backward&quot; which so far seems to be more entertaining but even worse
WRT gaining any useful ideas for how to structure a government in
Utopia...
  Regards,
    Scott
