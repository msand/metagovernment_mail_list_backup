&gt;<i> Pietro, I find this intro on sociocracy pretty good:

</I>&gt;<i> It might help you, but also should help everyone else.
</I>
A good overview, although the &quot;simulations&quot; lack a little real-world
feel to them (somehow they managed to create corporations with no
assholes in them!)

I also would like to correct my previous analysis of the depth chart:
Seems there must be *two* reps from a lower circle to a higher circle
to provide bidirectional feedback.  It also occurs to me that circles
will frequently have less than the full 40-member complement,
depending on geographical and subject-area boundaries.  Which means
you need to add at least a couple to my level predictions (i.e., a
global government would be 8 or more levels deep, which is definitely
*way* too many).

(snip)

&gt;<i> Thus, sociocracy offers a lot of freedom to choose what and how to do stuff,
</I>&gt;<i> while still retaining the right for anyone in the community to ask for a
</I>&gt;<i> decision revocation if they have rational objections. It takes more time
</I>&gt;<i> than usual for decisions to take place, but that's also why certain
</I>&gt;<i> decisions are more often than not being delegated (while still being
</I>&gt;<i> continuously analyzed and - if necessary - reviewed by the community). Which
</I>&gt;<i> is fine by me.
</I>
Agreed, sort of: looks to me like as long as the &quot;consent&quot; rule is
followed there is a lot of flexibility in the way decisions are made.
But again, as with consensus, this requires a world (or at least an
organization) without assholes.  We don't live in that world...

&gt;<i> [Jacopo]&gt; 2 does direct democracy need executive officers? Because if it
</I>&gt;<i> does I did not understand even what Direct Democracy is!
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't really. I may be wrong, but I believe that Athenian direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy was a social system which had a very different way of dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary powers activities seen nowadays.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I think different people will define direct democracy in different
</I>&gt;<i> ways, the common ground being that it should be a kind of social
</I>&gt;<i> organization model where people directly participate as much as possible in
</I>&gt;<i> the political decisions of the community. I think it is not out of the realm
</I>&gt;<i> of possibility that these decisions could extend into activities of what we
</I>&gt;<i> know as the Executive and Judiciary powers. However, the usual way that
</I>&gt;<i> people refers to direct democracy nowadays is that it should substitute the
</I>&gt;<i> representative system observed within the Legislative power.
</I>
Agreed, but I see no mechanism for a judicial branch in sociocracy.
The executive branch I think still exists because there remains a
hierarchy and although the executives (CEO, department heads, foremen,
etc.) have greatly reduced power compared with traditional
organizations, they still seem to me to have the authority to direct
action after a decision has been made.

The big impedance mismatch between sociocracy and what is required for
civil government in general is even more clear to me after reading
that article: Like religious groups corporations are a *lot* more
homogeneous than the general population.  Although they lack the
normative power of religion, they have something even better: A common
purpose.  People are willing to sacrifice a *lot* in the name of a
common purpose, which is why abuse of the population is so much easier
in wartime.  And in a corporation, it's always wartime ;-)

Which brings up another question WRT the purpose of metagovernment:
Are we all interested in *any* type of organization, or only those
that can be applied to governing free populations and not just
homogeneous organizations?

(snip)

&gt;<i> Also, sociocracy was formulated as a system for organizing a very real (and
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat successful) business, and it is being used today within very real
</I>&gt;<i> businesses (with varying degrees of success, I would believe). But I am not
</I>&gt;<i> sure how it would translate into a governance system in the public sector,
</I>&gt;<i> as I have no experience whatsoever with that. As a public sector employee
</I>&gt;<i> myself I believe it would be very very hard, because I think it would
</I>&gt;<i> require an extensive change in mindset from too many people for it to really
</I>&gt;<i> work...
</I>
And again, even public sector is far more homogeneous than the general
population because again you have at least *some* common goals.  I've
spent a lot of time debating libertarians and even a few reactionaries
on FaceBook over the past few weeks and can now say with some
certainty that getting any of them to agree to a system like this is
just out of the realm of possibility.  But they are far more receptive
to the idea of direct democracy and I think if you provided them with
a system that allowed them to work in it *without* having their
(sometimes quite astounding) prejudices constantly being challenged,
they'd probably use it.  We need to design a system to work with
people however they come to it, not one that requires a lot of
education, particularly if it also requires anyone to sacrifice their
prejudices.  Most people are just unwilling or unable to do that.

&gt;<i> However, it should work really well for organizations such as
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment!  :)
</I>
I think how long it took us to come up with the horribly watered-down
Home page in the last round is a counter-example.  The concept of
&quot;consent&quot; I think is a pretty apt description of how Vilfredo was
working (and indeed how we were instructed to use it) toward the end
there.  I for one would have preferred a more forceful statement, even
if I didn't agree with all of it, than what we ended up with.  My
opinion is that this kind of homeopathic result is just characteristic
of consent/consensus based systems.
