When I consider what needs to happen for us to avoid the myriad of looming catastrophes, and the timing within which it needs to happen, I think that developing a platform *outside* the constraints of contemporary political, religious, and economic structures&#8230;one that can skillfully focus on very specific solutions...is our only realistic hope.

Creating renewable energy technologies, replanting forests, educating children in third world countries, (and so on), isn't dependent on regional or global politics and economics so much as it is on the creative focus of individuals, and smalls groups like us.

What Elon Musk and his team have done for humanity and the environment, in just a few brief years, is way beyond what any polity has been able to accomplish through elected representation. The initiative the X-Prize foundation is launching for the education of illiterate children around the world will have a far greater cascade (in so many different domains) than any initiative the U.N. is capable of forwarding toward that end.  

In my mind, the only way we will bring about real *transformation*, requisite to both the timing and scale of urgency we are facing, is by developing an entirely new model/structure/process/platform for human evolution.  

I think we must begin building something that can empower a very large number of people, (and organizations), in a very short period of time.  If we involve contemporary political, religious, and economic institutions, we are just asking for (more of the same) delay and dysfunction&#8230;..too much entrenched polarity, negative momentum, greed, distrust, and apathy.  The current system is a dinosaur.  In my mind, the sooner we let go the better.

I believe we could begin this effort by looking at what really needs to happen and when. If we ask, 'what are our fundamental priorities?', I don&#8217;t think creating better systems of governance is tops on the list. Would be nice...but how long will that take?  I&#8217;d rather focus on advancing permaculture as an alternative to commercial agribusiness in order to save the bees, or towards developing technologies for cleaning up the mess that BP has left us with in the Gulf of Mexico, or providing water filtration systems for the billion or so people that live without potable water on a daily basis, &#8230;&#8230;and so on.  Those are issues that really matter&#8230;.to all of us.

In my mind, the only thing that will get the job done, from where we are currently positioned, is a very large segment of the population empowered to work synergistically towards solutions that connect us and provide for the whole of life. We don&#8217;t need a *democracy* to do these things.  We just need to create a platform that&#8217;s crowdsourced and funded, horizontal, and self-organizing.  One that is set it up to evolve and sustain it&#8217;s own process without a hierarchy determining it&#8217;s orientation and administration.

In the not to distant future the smart phone will be our ballot box and we&#8217;ll be making decisions globally through a hybridized social network. Corporations will be member owned and operate with a charter that has a heart and soul.  They will manage the infrastructure of our society.  Politicians will fade into the dark history of our troubled adolescence.   

The singularity is near.  I say, let&#8217;s create something (together) that has the potential to move us to the stars&#8230;.without leaving a wake of destruction on this lovely, beautiful planet we call home.  :)
