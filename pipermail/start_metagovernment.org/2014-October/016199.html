<PRE>Sorry I couldn't jump into this discussion sooner. After years of grappling with the democracy problem, I've proposed a very radical new approach. The KEY was solving the freedom problem. No matter how people juggle the elements of current democracy, after a vote is taken to select a SINGLE approach, all of those who don't agree with it get their freedom of choice denied. I solved that riddle. You can read about it on my website A3society.org/democracy  . Briefly, this new approach uses voting in a very different way. Rather than creating one choice that can be voted yes or no, or two polarized approaches to choose from, it creates a SMORGASBORD bill with many options. Each option is tagged with a cost and related restrictions and limitations. When people &quot;vote&quot;, they vote separately on each option. The votes are &quot;private&quot; from public view, but recorded. There is no longer anything like a bill. After the vote is taken, EVERYONE GETS WHAT THEY CHOSE! Everyone pays the cost that was stated in the &quot;bill&quot; and must comply with its limits and restrictions.

Please don't react to this with yes and no thinking. Try to follow where it goes. There would be no need for legislatures like we have. This is direct democracy in action. There is no longer any structure for political parties. There is no longer any structure for legislature corruption. There is no long any structure for 49% of the voters to be denied their choice. The need to give decision makers an exam, as noted in a comment below, is no longer even in the picture.

The first challenge that comes up is, of course, how does this address what appear to be single option decisions? For example: should we build a bridge or not? Should we go to war? Should a shopping mall be allowed a permit? But in each of these &quot;apparent&quot; single option cases, they are not so single optioned. Take the U.S. and the current ISIS disaster. This does not have to be treated like a single issue. Sure, there's the &quot;bomb them&quot; crowd. Let them vote to do that. Remember, there's a price tag. So, each &quot;bomb&quot; vote might have a $50,000 price tag that the voter must commit to pay. The vote, however, would also allow the &quot;negotiate&quot; voters to chose their option, which may have a different cost, like $2,000. HOWEVER, this process would also allow voters who want to approach the problem through &quot;humanitarian aid&quot; to choose that option, and select from a range of support costs: $100, $500, $1000, &quot;pick your contribution&quot;. This last option makes it clear that we have to approach this new world with totally different thinking. What is the &quot;value&quot; for a voter in choosing a $100 support package vs. $1000? Do they get future travel vouchers to the war area after it recovers? Maybe business vouchers? This will surely force us to be smarter about what we are doing.

Hello,

For a while I was looking for some similar concept on the internet, but without success. Do you know something similar ?
I am working on the concept on our wiki, you may comment there too, I am watching the page.

</I>&gt;<i> I thought that it may be easier to give potential decision-makers an exam before they may decide.
</I>&gt;<i> E.g. everyone creates one multiple choice question and publishes it with correct answer. 200 questions are randomly taken for the exam for potential decision-makers. The best 5 decision-makers than decide the thing that needs to be decided.
</I>&gt;<i> It may have some interesting advantages. It may force people into thinking and studying. It may take specialist into decision making too. There are no official boundaries and it is still localized. No age limit.  The question do not need to be translated. If we select randomly the decision makers from top 10% in the exam, the motivation may rise. It can be tuned or mixed with existing structures for better results and easier transition.
</I>&gt;<i> Still I should e.g. think more how make public sector respect the decisions and how to allocate resources for the decisions.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here i am coming from a view point that voting is not as important as useful discussions on a decision.  More idiots talking is not improvement and more anger leads only to desire but not to understanding or love that gives hope.  In spiritual structures love is the big item but see David deutsch.  And in others hope is the big item which tends around                         Christian flocks.  And expectation is big around say theosophy in the Erickson thread.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Between anger and idiots everyone gets punched in the nose and more anger gets gened and no understanding.  I tend to think of using the NSA dataset (very expensive to access) to translate between the value structures in a way that avoids the nose punches via a kind of censorship.  Sometimes I am a nice guy and so I think of an interactive conversation between the submitter and the dataset until both the dataset and the submitter reach an agreement.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A complex moderation system based simply on style issues and human discussion on the style could be a hurdle to general publication and cheap but we know the control of that barrier will become a strategic goal.
