<PRE>Hi Mark, (I may not have understood your question; ask again if I missed 
...)

In my understanding/experience, generally it works best to work out the 
vision first, to the point that one would be able to recognize a coded 
instantiation of the vision. Otherwise, one generally winds up throwing 
away a whole lot of code. (Even more than &quot;with a vision&quot;.)  (There are 
others who think that visions are a waste of time.)

At this point, it does not appear to me that there is a common vision 
within the community. Which means, at this point there is no shared 
guidance or motivation for coding.

Those individuals and sub-groups that are coding each have their own 
visions. The Active Projects and Related Projects pages list some of those:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Map">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Map</A>

The particular project that we have been discussing on this thread (an 
on-line open-source Virtual Worlds Social Systems Laboratory) is huge, 
as in &quot;land a human on the moon&quot; huge. But, if we had the $160 billion 
that Apple is sitting on, we could probably get it up and running in a 
couple of years (and thereby maybe Save The World). (If anybody knows 
somebody at Apple ...)
