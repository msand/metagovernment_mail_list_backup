<PRE>I am not adding inactive related projects to the list. I also remove my 
inactive projects from active projects list.
I think the lists are too long now, if they are ordered alphabetically.

Maybe that we are self-censored. The group is defined by mailing list 
and there are many visions in the group, but only one specific vision is 
on the page that seems to be official. If nothing else, it is confusing.

Kind regards
Michael
