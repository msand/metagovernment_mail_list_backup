This is just not how it plays out in my experience.  Here in Boulder
we're going through *exactly* this scenario with roads in the County,
which the County government is trying not to pay for rebuilding.  They
want the rural subdivision residents to pay, and even passed a law
imposing a special tax on them to do so.  But the rural residents
filed a lawsuit that the County lost and so had to reimburse millions
of dollars that they'd already collected.  And we still don't know
who's going to pay to fix those roads because the County spent all
that money on other things (mostly social services and some purchases
of open space).  The County people rightly claim that they pay sales
taxes to the various cities (because that's where all the businesses
are) who use that money not to improve all roads, but only the roads
in the City.  This kind of stuff happens constantly here, not just
with roads, but with school districts, mining rights (fracking is big
here), and water projects.  Any time you have multiple overlapping
jurisdictions there is great inefficiency in the system because
everyone just points fingers at the other guy and it takes expensive
and timeconsuming lawsuits to come up with a solution (lawsuits, I
must point out, that the lawyers who are the people primarily making
these laws in the first place, all benefit from).

So my system only has two levels, Locality and Globality to avoid all
this inefficiency.  I've read many proposals with only the Local
level, but IMHO there has to be at least two levels because there has
to be an authority to coordinate projects between Localities and there
are some things (like defense, monetary system, and natural monopolies
like health care insurance) that are just too inefficient to run
separately at the local level.  States and Counties go away, and good
riddance: I've read various sets of statutes at those two levels and
I'm not really completely sure why, but the quality of the codes at
those levels is just inferior to that even at local levels, at least
for cities above about 100K or so population.

And, again, &quot;hoping&quot; that people will vote to support the common
interest is just naive and represents a fundamental misunderstanding
of human nature.  There is actually a very limited amount of altruism
like this available and if you design your system without accounting
for that parameter it'll either just fail (if you assume too much) or
be suboptimal (if you assume too little).
  Regards,
    Scott
