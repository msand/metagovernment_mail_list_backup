&gt;<i> Scott you have been too pessimistic while Steve is optimistic.
</I>
Sort of: I'm apparently more optimistic about the timeframe ;-)

&gt;<i> I am pessimistic but I see how fast labor and production are changing so
</I>&gt;<i> fast.
</I>
In a case of synchronicity, which seems to strike me a lot lately
(maybe something to do with my relatively unfettered circumstances or
aging brain), but shortly after I flamed Steve (sorry Steve!) I
started the next book on my list, &quot;Biosociology&quot; by Walsh.  It's an
effort by a sociologist to try to rescue the field by tying it more
closely to biology, particularly genetics, evolution, and
neuroscience.  But I wouldn't even call it &quot;sociology&quot; since it really
deals more with the individual, putting it squarely in the field of
&quot;evolutionary psychology&quot;.  Anyway, it's a very good book, and I
highly recommend it, particularly if you don't have time to read a
whole bunch of other books (he says a lot of the same stuff Pinker
says, but about 10 times more efficiently ;-)

Anyway, a couple of things jumped out at me, the first being his
thrashing of his &quot;optimistic&quot; colleagues, who he labels as
&quot;unconstrained visionaries&quot;, for being naive and for their irrational
rejection of genetics as a strong factor in the development of
individuals and culture (yeah, it's no wonder I like the book! ;-)
The second is are his repeated comments about how both political
liberals and conservatives have got it wrong (liberals using the wrong
principles, conservatives using the wrong methods).  Which is another
perspective that is near and dear to me: It doesn't sound very
exciting, but my prediction is that the next generation of democracy
will be the rise of the moderates, enabled by us putting the tools in
their hands to enable them to efficiently do a job they don't really
want to do and indeed may not even be particularly qualified for.

&gt;<i> 3d printing is going to put out of work so many people that is hard to
</I>&gt;<i> imagine today. But shared production tool ownership will be distributed. The
</I>&gt;<i> consumistic system will disappear as we know it because recycling will be
</I>&gt;<i> the model. Is now just a matter to get the new energy in place.
</I>&gt;<i> I do believe in a continuously evolving governance up to the perfection. But
</I>&gt;<i> we are not ready, is a matter of 2 generation. As soon as the disconnected
</I>&gt;<i> will disappear the connected will engage and they will make the changes that
</I>&gt;<i> we where not able to agree upon.
</I>
Again, I call that naive: The incompetent have been with us since we
climbed out of trees (and probably before that).  To expect now that
technology will wave a magic wand and somehow eliminate them is
setting yourself (and all of us) up for failure.

&gt;<i> I think the best think we should do is to connect people to a decisional
</I>&gt;<i> platform on a daily basis, more or less what I do for Airesis. We are going
</I>&gt;<i> to have soon the 4.0 and by April next year we will have anonymous vote
</I>&gt;<i> auditing. By using the software we identify all the problem we explore here.
</I>&gt;<i> Mathematical formulas are going to help to reach the common sense not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily the consensus.
</I>
I agree that this is the more reasonable goal.  The more I learn about
this stuff, the more comfortable I am with the fact that the
revolution is going to happen without a lot of people, the same as all
previous revolutions.  About the best we can do is make one thing
different: We won't have to kill off or imprison a significant portion
of the population to achieve it.  There are still going to be a lot of
people who are not going to be happy with the new system (in mine it's
the 25% who are authoritarian (which is mostly those who identify as
&quot;social conservatives&quot;).  But this is just the way it has to be
because they've been running the show for the last 10,000 years or so
and haven't done such a great job of it so it's time to take the reins
out of their hands.

&gt;<i> So as the time goes i get every day more optimistic.
</I>&gt;<i> As I monitor the political stage I see that the current leaders are not
</I>&gt;<i> competent and so, thousand of people already know that, I believe the change
</I>&gt;<i> will happen swiftly and this will be created by an economic crash.
</I>
I hope you're wrong about this too. The great danger is that in this
scenario the resulting scarcity of resources activates our
authoritarian mode with the result not that we take inventory of our
situation and pick a new system to get us out of it (as your optimism
would predict), but instead fall back on an older failsafe: Turn
control over to a dictator who will go out and start killing people in
the name of protecting us from adversity.
  Regards,
    Scott
