Agreed.  And I personally think this is the bigger issue: A bad County
commissioner or sheriff could make *your* life living hell, but he's
unlikely to be much danger to our species as a whole.  Unlike, say, a
psychopath who manages to gain control over a nuclear state.

</I>
I think not, but we do have to make it possible to run the system on
cell phones.  Those are becoming ubiquitous even in outlying areas in
third-world countries.  They may not have enough bandwidth (or screen
space) to allow everyone to put their 2 cents in on every proposal,
but if they can at least set up their &quot;Goals&quot; section and designate a
handful of proxies, even if they only do it one time they'll have
vastly more control than what they have now (who cares if you can vote
for new &quot;delegates&quot; every two years if none of them can be counted on
to vote like you'd want?)

&gt;<i> How to prevent Sybil attack ? There is still quite some number of people who
</I>&gt;<i> do not have ID. In real life is it solved by Election ink. How do we solve
</I>&gt;<i> it ?
</I>
This whole problem goes away with radical transparency, specifically
open voting.  You don't have to worry about anyone creating fake
accounts because they could only create one for an existing person and
anyone (including that person) could verify whether the correct vote
was recorded for them.

&gt;<i> I think we need to solve these questions. When you do not solve it, I tend
</I>&gt;<i> to see your projects just as utopias or visions and others may too.
</I>
Agreed, although being specific about requiring something that people
are not familiar with has it's own downsides, even if you've got logic
and all the experimental data on your side.  I'm still amazed when I
see the advocates of some new e-democracy system fall down this
rathole, because it just dooms them to failure, and for no good reason
other than to quiet down a few authoritarians who would have no qualms
about rigging the system to benefit themselves if given the chance
(e.g., this whole voter-ID thing we're going through in the US is just
shameful).

&gt;<i> I was solving these questions and I have solved them somehow. I felt sorry
</I>&gt;<i> that it did not catch your attention, but maybe I have forgotten to tell you
</I>&gt;<i> about it :D
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway here is it.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/EvoA">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/EvoA</A>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think ?
</I>
Again, looks like it's primarily concerned with representative
government, which for me is a non-starter as a feature of the
next-generation political system.
  Regards,
     Scott
