<PRE>Dear Jacopo,
dear all,

thanks for including me in this ML.
Actually, I can't remember whether it was Benjamin I met in San Francisco,
together with Alanna, at the #PBConf two weeks ago. Were you?

In any case, this email came at the right moment. I was in California and I
came back to Italy with a firm believe we need to work of that (how don't
know how, but we must!). Jacopo knows how I strongly believe on
Participatory Budgeting as a way to undermine the current democracy and
rebuild a new one. So I am the first who can sustain any effort to spread
it.

The point is that, yes, we didn't find the panacea to solve all the global
problems already - there are still many ideas of PB and democracy too! -
but we must join forces anyway, at least to take all advantage of the
progress which can from one or another of ours experiments: what will
happen if I (had to) start developing my software and then I realize that
the Jacopo's is working so much better that is worthy to divert and going
to help him? Or if I would like to take a piece of someone else's job to
integrate to my software and viceversa (the login, a particular
deliberative tool such as Loomio or within Airesis)? To sum up, is
interoperability
enough - no matter how useful it is anyway - or do you think that another
step ahead could be possible, towards a kind of &quot;common language&quot;, a common
&quot;code&quot; to adopt, thus avoiding any risk of duplication? Jacopo well know
what I am talking about, unfortunately. We made a Conference
&lt;<A HREF="http://codicidellademocrazia.partecipate.it/">http://codicidellademocrazia.partecipate.it/</A>&gt;to debate on that issue, and
it is still difficult to find a common ground, to work together.

I am sorry but I am not a programmer, I am a political scientist. I am
usually very naive on such stuffs and I am glad to share them with you all.
But the experience of the last years tells me that a &quot;meta-language&quot;, a
common framework, is necessary...at least to keep walking together, even if
not necessarily to the same path.

In any case, I do strongly believe we need to find a common &quot;democratic&quot;
ground anyway, then promote and pursue, implementing, it. It must be done
in both digital and &quot;analogical&quot; way. Building a software is probably not
enough, we need to build up also a movement who can spread such idea of
democracy (and thus the software which can facilitate it). Similarly to
what is happening for the OpenData: I believe this issue won't have the
impact on democracy we are looking for, but the broad interest and
knowledge on it is gathering lots of energies towards its aims.

Hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
Stefano S.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Each of us represented the reference projects in the best interest of

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We share the same common denominator of the necessity of extended or

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> With surprise we realize that we are both discussing with DemocracyOS
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the need for interoperability, Benjamin mention also that they are seeking
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> collaboration with other platform and I ask him to list them here and to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which extent.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ( I close the windows and lost the note we share in the chat!!)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Benjamin meet with Pietro Speroni and with Giovanni Allegretti and we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> share the same idea on the need of a participatory budgeting module, I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mention the module architecture we are seeking to deliver and the vision
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> was shared.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Both platform are developed in Ruby and both platform are released in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> AGPL3.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Loomio that is released in beta will officially release a final version
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in November.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Airesis is in the testing phase of the 4.0 version that will be released
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when our testing will be completed and the platform sufficiently stable.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> While Airesis is developed by us as a full platform, Loomio is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> considered more as a module in a framework.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The Loomio team is definitely better in collecting funds, in contrast
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> our political situation is definitely worst, I mention how the M5S have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> twisted the direct participation into a closed platform, while NZ i
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> definitely a better place for this kind of development.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I mention the structure of Tecnologie Democratiche Association and I did
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not ask how they are structured.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The development process of the two platform is decided in the respective
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> platform in an identical way.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Benjamin and I agreed to bring the discussion further in the direction
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the development of Open API and we agree that as soon as any of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> group produce a quality document in this regard we should share the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> knowledge and  establish direct analyst and programmer communication in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> order to further explore and implement interoperability. At this time both
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> head developers are completely absorbed by their  internal tasks and we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> identified end of November early December as the best time to reopen
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My final judgment of the meeting is an A+ or in our standard a 10 e lode.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I ask Benjamin to comment on this report, add as pleased and disclose
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the full report to the Airesis and Loomio mailing list. (Benjamin you can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> send it to me and I will publish in our ML)
