<PRE>Hmm.  &quot;near&quot;implies a metric.  Scalar klicks puts the ISS staff in my
state.  Try thinking about geography and transport.  You need  yardsticks
that change as they move around in whatever space you want to think about.
Also I assure you rural West power structures generally hate the urban
centers.  Even 50 miles away.  Figure we have to work hard to avoid
manifesting that relationship.  By the way my municipality has about 800
people.  My county a bit more than a 100,000.  To tjhink about getting
700,000 people together in a state with a few million people is bemusing.

&gt;<i> Hello all, this seems to be a concern for a few of us of how to properly
</I>&gt;<i> manage distribution at a larger scale operation. Sorry for the lack of
</I>&gt;<i> proper terminology in this piece. Also the numbers used are probably all
</I>&gt;<i> wrong but the concept I think is sound. I invented a system of taxation
</I>&gt;<i> that should work for this global governance project. Please correct any
</I>&gt;<i> problems I overlooked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll start off by making a few presumptions, this is to introduce the idea
</I>&gt;<i> in a global scale mindset. Everyone is plugged into a global system of
</I>&gt;<i> governance, everyone's residence, annual income, everything is documented.
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone has an equal say in which laws, projects etc. get passed by way of
</I>&gt;<i> online forum or some mode of decision making process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For simplicity sake, everyone has a flat tax in the world. 20% of
</I>&gt;<i> everyone's annual earnings go towards the governing body to be used for
</I>&gt;<i> public projects big and small, from installing a new bench in a public park
</I>&gt;<i> to sending a spaceship to mars. All the money comes from the 20% of
</I>&gt;<i> humanities annual earnings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, every individual is part of one group at every level. I've label each
</I>&gt;<i> group for simplicity but each group is defined by the numbers more then the
</I>&gt;<i> title, municipal (700 thousand people), state (15 million people), federal
</I>&gt;<i> (300 million people), global (7 billion people). The group that a
</I>&gt;<i> particular individual is involved in exists within the boundaries of every
</I>&gt;<i> individual, so your municipality would simply be the closest 700 thousand
</I>&gt;<i> people to your specific residence in the world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every year the budget is set based on the collected tax, the taxes are
</I>&gt;<i> distributed between the groups (a federal group would have a higher budget
</I>&gt;<i> then a municipal group because more people are contributing to it), every
</I>&gt;<i> group receives the same budget ( e.g. every municipality has a 30 million
</I>&gt;<i> dollar budget, every state has 2 billion, etc.), every individual is able
</I>&gt;<i> to see the budget in each of their groups and witness it become diminished
</I>&gt;<i> over the year as funds get diverted to projects passed by the people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, an individual has a project they'd like to do through the use of tax
</I>&gt;<i> dollars. They pick their point on the map where the project is to be
</I>&gt;<i> constructed/implemented, then depending on which level they want to funds
</I>&gt;<i> to come from (might choose a larger group like federal if the project is
</I>&gt;<i> larger in scale) the project is opened up to the closest number of people
</I>&gt;<i> in proximity to the project for discussion and voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> E.g. Somebody wants to use 2 million dollars of the municipal budget to
</I>&gt;<i> construct a new gym for a high school, they appeal at the municipal level
</I>&gt;<i> to fund the project, the closest 700 thousand people to the actual gym then
</I>&gt;<i> get to debate the idea and vote on whether to grant the funds to complete
</I>&gt;<i> the project. If the idea passes then 2 million is taken out of the budget
</I>&gt;<i> for those 700 thousand people regardless of whether they voted for it or
</I>&gt;<i> not. Then another guy proposes another project on the other side of town
</I>&gt;<i> that includes some of the people that voted on the gym project as well (it
</I>&gt;<i> will not include all of them, just the ones that are within the proximity
</I>&gt;<i> of both projects) this project passes as well and more funds are taken out
</I>&gt;<i> of budget of the affected individuals. Once the budget is used up it can no
</I>&gt;<i> longer fund projects within the area, it must appeal to a larger group or
</I>&gt;<i> wait for next year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the gist of it, I can go into more detail but I just wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> introduce the idea and see what you guys thought of it.  There is proper
</I>&gt;<i> distribution of resources that get to be spent by the immediate community.
</I>&gt;<i> It also includes a form of checks and balance approach with the larger
</I>&gt;<i> groups being able to veto any project that might affect them as well. This
</I>&gt;<i> model destroys the notion of set borders, it morphs for every project to
</I>&gt;<i> include the most immediately affected people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers.
