<PRE>Scott you have been too pessimistic while Steve is optimistic.
I am pessimistic but I see how fast labor and production are changing so
fast.
3d printing is going to put out of work so many people that is hard to
imagine today. But shared production tool ownership will be distributed.
The consumistic system will disappear as we know it because recycling will
be the model. Is now just a matter to get the new energy in place.
I do believe in a continuously evolving governance up to the perfection.
But we are not ready, is a matter of 2 generation. As soon as the
disconnected will disappear the connected will engage and they will make
the changes that we where not able to agree upon.
I think the best think we should do is to connect people to a decisional
platform on a daily basis, more or less what I do for Airesis. We are going
to have soon the 4.0 and by April next year we will have anonymous vote
auditing. By using the software we identify all the problem we explore
here. Mathematical formulas are going to help to reach the common sense not
necessarily the consensus.
So as the time goes i get every day more optimistic.
As I monitor the political stage I see that the current leaders are not
competent and so, thousand of people already know that, I believe the
change will happen swiftly and this will be created by an economic crash.
Peace
Jacopo

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My guess is that whatever system humans puts together for the next
</I>&gt;<i> iteration of *Democracy*, it&#8217;s going to look more and more like what&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> happening at *Valve*.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my mind, it will be self-organizing, very creative, employ the
</I>&gt;<i> assistance of AI, &#8230;.and will most likely be way more complex than we can
</I>&gt;<i> possibly imagine from our current vantage point. Scaling won&#8217;t be an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> We will be so connected and empowered technologically that coming to
</I>&gt;<i> decisions in large groups will be relatively simple and routine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you're wrong, because I think we can't wait that long ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In a decade or two, I don&#8217;t think there will be much *government*, per
</I>&gt;<i> say. That job will be (is being) taken over by the Corporate model of
</I>&gt;<i> managing our affairs. The Corporate model will be taken over by the
</I>&gt;<i> Cooperative model. The Cooperative model will run on a continually evolving
</I>&gt;<i> platform/network/program/intelligence for managing the mission of our
</I>&gt;<i> self-organization. The mission is *All for All*.  This will be (is being)
</I>&gt;<i> driven by the same shift in consciousness that bring all of us to this
</I>&gt;<i> list&#8230;.and will be built on the bits and pieces now developing among us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No offense intended, but this strikes me as being naive to the point
</I>&gt;<i> of being delusional.  You seem to have completely ignored the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that Valve or any corporation simply doesn't have to deal with the
</I>&gt;<i> issues that we face when trying to enable the general population to
</I>&gt;<i> make better decisions.  Resource redistribution I consider to be the
</I>&gt;<i> most significant of these: There *are* no poor, undereducated,
</I>&gt;<i> disabled, old, very young, mentally ill, or otherwise disadvantaged
</I>&gt;<i> individuals at Valve so they are simply spared the difficult decisions
</I>&gt;<i> about how they're going to provide for those people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You've *also* made two other fundamental mistakes.  The first is the
</I>&gt;<i> assumption that cooperation is a viable alternative to competition as
</I>&gt;<i> a governing principle except in extremely homogeneous domains.  This
</I>&gt;<i> is just wrong, as been shown countless times in countless areas.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> against human (and indeed animal) nature, something we ignore at our
</I>&gt;<i> peril.  Maybe think of your proposal as a type of prohibition, which
</I>&gt;<i> is another example of an &quot;enlightened&quot; principle that just never works
</I>&gt;<i> out in the real world.  People simply don't follow laws that they
</I>&gt;<i> consider immoral, and while we can count on a certain amount of help
</I>&gt;<i> from human's instinctive conceptions of fairness (which other animals
</I>&gt;<i> share, telling us that it's a deeply embedded one), you can't
</I>&gt;<i> legislate morality which is what your proposal, and any sort of
</I>&gt;<i> cooperative design, would require.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second is the classic &quot;humans as a blank slate&quot; assumption that
</I>&gt;<i> sociologists are particularly prone to.  Unfortunately they've all
</I>&gt;<i> been proven wrong at every turn and this is in large part why
</I>&gt;<i> sociology in general is ranked at the very bottom of the social
</I>&gt;<i> sciences (which in turn are ranked at the bottom of all sciences) in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of prestige and perceived rigor and effectiveness.  The fact is
</I>&gt;<i> that sociocracy is just another feeble expression of this philosophy,
</I>&gt;<i> a watered-down Marxism that has no more chance of being successful
</I>&gt;<i> (and of course note that sociocracy *is* a product of sociologists).
</I>&gt;<i> Like morality, you can't legislate altruism, or educate it into
</I>&gt;<i> people, which is something your Cooperative model requires.
</I>&gt;<i> Particularly when it not only fails to meet the morality requirements
</I>&gt;<i> but also lacks simple engineering efficiency (e.g., the pace of
</I>&gt;<i> development and improvement in a domain is highly correlated with the
</I>&gt;<i> degree of competition).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As together we choose, together it will be.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problem is, we need a better system *now* even if we can't *all* agree
</I>&gt;<i> on it.  If 25% of the population has to get dragged into a new thing
</I>&gt;<i> that they're just instinctively not comfortable with, well, we just
</I>&gt;<i> need to ease their pain as much as possible without allowing them a
</I>&gt;<i> blocking vote.  Insisting on &quot;consensus&quot; or &quot;consent&quot; from them is
</I>&gt;<i> just another way of guaranteeing preservation of the status quo.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
