<PRE>Hi Scott,

In 
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-October/007353.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-October/007353.html</A>

    directly from where we are currently to there without any
    intermediate steps.

So you say. I say: putting *any* sort of significantly new social policy 
or sub-system directly into service in the real world without first 
testing and developing it and comparing it extensively &quot;in the 
laboratory&quot; would be foolish, and reasonable people will -- for good 
reason -- be highly unlikely to agree to such a course of action.

We now have technologies available that enable us to collaboratively 
create (if we choose) an online Virtual Worlds game/environment, that 
can be as realistic as it needs to be (from the perspective of fully 
implementing, testing, demonstrating, comparing, and popularizing new 
social system visions).

Now that the possibility exists to create a near-perfect laboratory 
environment within which to test and compare social system visions, I 
take it to be utterly irresponsible for anyone to suggest that *ANY* 
significant social system change be made in the real world without first 
testing it, demonstrating it, and comparing it in that laboratory 
environment.

In ThePlan (page 77, as part of the implementation schedule), you 
express one piece of this idea:

    Design and implement &quot;virtual world&quot; simulations of The Plan, and
    test them to find exploits and to help refine reasonable Goals and
    preliminary tax rates (i.e., these might be games like SimCity or
    Second Life, but with challenges from the real-world thrown in such
    as natural and human-caused disasters, child-rearing,
    sickness/accidents/deaths, etc.). Develop and test military and
    international political simulations to help refine Planish policies
    and tactics.

What is missing from this passage is the understanding that the social 
system of The Plan (fully operational and operating in its own virtual 
world) must experimentally prove itself against other bright new visions 
(each also fully operational and operating in its own virtual world), in 
order to legitimately win the hearts and minds of the general public. 
(We are talking science, Baby! The scientific method fully embraces 
competition among competing visions, with those competitions settled on 
the field of actual experimentation, not just on the field of listserv 
word-wars, Loomio votes, or propaganda/advertising campaigns.)

So, with all of the foregoing as preamble, let us revisit your criticism 
of The Prime Directive, of Blinap, and of Isonomea:

    directly from where we are currently to there without any
    intermediate steps.

Your hypothesis is that it would/will be &quot;better&quot; (the metrics of 
&quot;better&quot; are unspecified) for us (humanity) to take an intermediate step 
first (that is, real-world implementation of ThePlan) and then at some 
unspecified time after that to take further steps (to adopt The Prime 
Directive and implement Blinap/Isonomea, or whatever).

Your formulation of the hypothesis omits the possibility of doing all of 
this sort of research (testing these sorts of comparative hypotheses) in 
our virtual worlds laboratory, before taking any steps at all with 
respect to real-world social systems.

I suggest to you that it is both good science and good engineering to 
test first (in the laboratory), and only *after* thorough comparative 
testing in the laboratory to then propose implementing *anything* in the 
real world.
