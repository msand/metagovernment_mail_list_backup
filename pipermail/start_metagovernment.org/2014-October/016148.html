<PRE>Hi Scott, (continuing our chat ...)

Scott&gt; I like the way this [The Prime Directive] is totally outside the 
box (doesn't even contain the word government!) And I'd even sign on 
because I agree with it in principle. But, like Blinap, it may be a bit 
of a stretch to go directly from where we are currently to there without 
any intermediate steps.

Ned&gt; Your hypothesis is that it would/will be &quot;better&quot; (the metrics of 
&quot;better&quot; are unspecified) for us (humanity) to take an intermediate step 
first (that is, real-world implementation of ThePlan) and then at some 
unspecified time after that to take further steps (to adopt The Prime 
Directive and implement Blinap/Isonomea, or whatever).

Scott&gt; Yes.

Ned&gt; Your formulation of the hypothesis omits the possibility of doing 
all of this sort of research (testing these sorts of comparative 
hypotheses) in our virtual worlds laboratory, before taking any steps at 
all with respect to real-world social systems.

Scott&gt; Umm, you skipped a step there: The Plan includes an explicit 
migration path, but I don't see one for Blinap or the Prime Directive 
except through something like the Plan that first unifies world 
government, thereby making the military issue go away and making the 
economic system *much* simpler to tweak.

Ned&gt; The Isonomea project also includes an explicit migration path. That 
path *BEGINS* with creating the Virtual Worlds game/environment (that 
anyone/everyone in the world can play), and then testing and comparing 
proposed new social system arrangements thoroughly in that virtual 
environment, before making *ANY* changes in the real world.

    Ned&gt; You seem to be suggesting that we skip this virtual-worlds
    testing and comparing step, and go straight to trying to establish a
    one-world centralized government possessing overwhelming military
    power and full direct control of the global economy, with no
    virtual-worlds testing and comparing at all prior to commencing
    real-world implementation. Really?
