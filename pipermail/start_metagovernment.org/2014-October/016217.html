If you're into politics I'd also recommend John Dean's book
&quot;Conservatives without Compassion&quot; which is what Altemeyer says
inspired him to produce that book.  It covers much of the same
material, but with application to the actual US political scene,
particularly neocon behavior during the Bush presidency.  But IMHO
there's no real need to go back through Altemeyer's other books or
papers: I have, and this last book is the most readable and complete
of the collection.

</I>
There will certainly be issues where authoritarians in different
Localities will cancel each other out, but that doesn't mean we can
ignore their influence.  Firstly because this general dissent will
mean smaller majorities will be seen for proposals that affect
multiple Localities differently (i.e., there goes that consensus thing
again).  Secondly, especially during early part of the transition,
there will be cases where all the SDAs in all the Localities will vote
as a block (trade policy being a likely area).  To prevent the
adoption of irrational (tribalistic) policies it's still going to
require massive participation from the rest of the population to
overwhelm SDA biases.

&gt;<i> I was also thinking about the filters a little bit more. The thing is that
</I>&gt;<i> we are unable to enter most of the useful filters into the voting mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> ( and that is maybe right, it is so easy to make a mistake). On the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand we might be able to enter a mechanism that allows to create personal
</I>&gt;<i> filters. We may allow the citizen to say that anybody who suits some
</I>&gt;<i> conditions can in some proportion decide for her. You may see it as a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal for improvement of proxies. E.g. when you will not have enough
</I>&gt;<i> time, you will bind your vote with condition, that the group of people who

</I>&gt;<i> say that in all proposals that contain the word &quot;chemistry&quot;, you will be
</I>&gt;<i> represented just by people who have certain degree in chemistry (from
</I>&gt;<i> certain universities)(you may make your amygdala test to apply too).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think ?
</I>
An interesting proposal.  It would be nice to have the flexibility to
designate different proxies/delegates for proposals in different
domains.  One thing I'm definitely planning is to provide the option
of a weighted list of proxies.  This will handle the situation where a
single proxy doesn't vote on a particular proposal and when multiple
proxies vote in opposition to each other (it'll be your own little
&quot;instant runoff&quot; system).  I'm also trying to figure out how to
prioritize proposals by an individual's interests.  Sort of like what
FaceBook does, but the categories would be explicitly specified in a
user's &quot;Goals&quot; section (e.g., &quot;I want to see everything concerning
land use policy in my Locality&quot; or &quot;I want to see any animal-rights
proposals at the top of my feed&quot; or &quot;don't bother me with anything
related to taxes as I let my proxies handle all that stuff&quot;).

A lot of this type of stuff we'll just have to establish by
prototyping.  Flexibility is nice, but not when it makes the system so
complicated that the majority of people (who will want to minimize
their time investment) can't figure out how to use it effectively.
  Regards,
    Scott
