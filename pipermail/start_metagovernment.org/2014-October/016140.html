&gt;<i> My (here proposed) answer to this question is that it might be good to start

</I>&gt;<i> a list of such filter-principles to use in vetting candidate visions would

</I>&gt;<i> would potentially have lasting and general usefulness. (Scott will want to
</I>&gt;<i> have &quot;effective&quot; and &quot;efficient&quot; and maybe &quot;Paleolithic&quot; on that list.)
</I>
Minor quibble: Paleolithic (&quot;stone age&quot;) is probably not the best way
describe my proposal.  A better term is EEA-matching (Era of
Evolutionary Adaptation), that interval that humans evolved to best
fit their environment.  That said, it is correct that this is mostly
the Paleolithic and/or Pleistocene eras we're talking about, but I
recommend Wade's &quot;A Troublesome Inheritance&quot; for evidence that
significant evolution has occurred even in the last few thousand
years.

&gt;<i> In the interest of grounding this discussion with an example: were we to
</I>&gt;<i> decide to undertake &quot;The Metagovernment Vision Project&quot;, and to execute the
</I>&gt;<i> plan here proposed, and to use Vilfredo as our synthesis/decision tool, my
</I>&gt;<i> first filter-principle proposal (to Vilfredo) would be THE PRIME DIRECTIVE:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be acceptable, a candidate vision (social system or sub-system) must be
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly, intentionally designed to eliminate Power Over Other People in
</I>&gt;<i> every way possible. By design, there must be no concentrations of power
</I>&gt;<i> entailed, caused, or permitted within or by the envisioned social
</I>&gt;<i> (sub-)system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for this is simple. It does not matter through what means power
</I>&gt;<i> is initially concentrated (through political, criminal, police, military,
</I>&gt;<i> economic, financial, religious, or whatever other means) -- the end result
</I>&gt;<i> will always be the same because power is fungible: any form of concentrated
</I>&gt;<i> power can be used to acquire more power of any kind. As soon as there is any
</I>&gt;<i> concentration of power of any kind produced by any social sub-system, the
</I>&gt;<i> overall social system will commence to morph toward further concentration of
</I>&gt;<i> power: the existence of concentrations of power sets up positive feedback
</I>&gt;<i> loops that lead to further concentration of power.
</I>
I like the way this is totally outside the box (doesn't even contain
the word government!)  And I'd even sign on because I agree with it in
principle.  But, like Blinap, it may be a bit of a stretch to go
directly from where we are currently to there without any intermediate
steps.  In particular, eliminating financial and military power are
just things I don't think we're ready for yet.  Maybe we should
restrict the metagovernment vision to dealing with political power
(leaving eliminating religious power to the individual projects,
because I think we *are* also ready for that one).

&gt;<i> (Given that Vilfredo always wants to start with a question, I guess we would
</I>&gt;<i> have to play Jeopardy to come up with a question to which this proposal
</I>&gt;<i> would appropriately respond ...)
</I>
I'd still recommend we try out a rank-order system instead.  Everyone
generate a list of what they want, we use that tool to rank order
them, then pick the top 5 to generate a proposal.  Which we can then
work on in Vilfredo if it still needs tweaking.
  Regards,
    Scott
