<PRE>Michael,

To your first point, the word &#8220;vote&#8221; is a problem. Votes become choices. So, a person is &#8220;never&#8221; denied the ability to vote for something. But, with this system in full play, people would be guided by &#8220;option selection&#8221; support software that tells them how much money they&#8217;ve committed with ALL of their choices. The government is NOT a &#8220;philanthropy for all&#8221;. So, people will have to make tradeoffs. It depends on what people want. Let&#8217;s use healthcare as an example. People now choose medical insurance on a sliding scale. Better coverage costs more money. So, as a society, we could decide with high agreement, say 80%, through straw polls, that the &#8220;government&#8221; should only offer 3 options. The low number might be desirable to people to keep the system simple. In that case, the costs for all plans would be in a range that the 80% can afford. Wealthy people would just go outside the system for additional coverage, which would be allowed. In practice, the straw polls would ask people: how many levels make sense to you? How much can you afford? And, remember, the major difference with this approach is that the cost benefit analysis is TOTALLY transparent, and people get what they choose.

What will be the &#8220;effect&#8221;? For a start, there will no longer be government budget problems. Every program balances. Transportation &#8211; same story. Fares balance expenses plus capital costs. On the other side of the equation, no one gets charged for transportation to pay for other programs. No one gets charged &#8220;income tax&#8221; to subsidize transportation.

The &#8220;nuclear warfare&#8221; issue is perfect. People &#8220;protest&#8221; against it. But how do they &#8220;vote&#8221; against it? Getting a &quot;direct vote&quot; referendum with that question would almost certainly result in most people voting to support a U.S. stockpile of weapons. Without it, the Russians would just take over our country. What my approach does is force everyone to understand the issues better and create smaller options that we can actually do something about. For example, Iran keeps pushing to build nukes. What if the world asked them, &#8220;tell us what you want to: a. stop; b. agree to a 1 year moratorium with negotiations; c. agree to a 2 year moratorium with financial support to build new universities etc.&#8221; Once these kinds of questions are asked, we can find out what they value and greatly expand the list. THEN, the anti-nukes get some real choices, which, of course, they have to financially stand behind.

When people say the costs involved CAN&#8217;T be determined, in most cases it&#8217;s not true. It&#8217;s because our society is made up of people who are not very good at understanding complex issues. The governments, which could answer the questions, don&#8217;t want to  answer them either. If they did,  their hands would be tied about what should be done and their corruption scam would be blown.

Do I understand it correctly, that only those, who will have enough money will be able to vote for some choices ? What will be the effect on public transport ? Healthcare ?

What about externalities ? e.g. I vote against nuclear warfare. I do not pay for it OK, but I still get the externality, the risk. Would you like to internalize the externality ? How will you find a price ? Similar examples are production of chemical substances, agricultural externalities and externalities in transport.

Kind regards

&gt;<i> Sorry I couldn't jump into this discussion sooner. After years of grappling with the democracy problem, I've proposed a very radical new approach. The KEY was solving the freedom problem. No matter how people juggle the elements of current democracy, after a vote is taken to select a SINGLE approach, all of those who don't agree with it get their freedom of choice denied. I solved that riddle. You can read about it on my website A3society.org/democracy  . Briefly, this new approach uses voting in a very different way. Rather than creating one choice that can be voted yes or no, or two polarized approaches to choose from, it creates a SMORGASBORD bill with many options. Each option is tagged with a cost and related restrictions and limitations. When people &quot;vote&quot;, they vote separately on each option. The votes are &quot;private&quot; from public view, but recorded. There is no longer anything like a bill. After the vote is taken, EVERYONE GETS WHAT THEY CHOSE! Everyone pays the cost that was stated in the &quot;bill&quot; and must comply with its limits and restrictions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't react to this with yes and no thinking. Try to follow where it goes. There would be no need for legislatures like we have. This is direct democracy in action. There is no longer any structure for political parties. There is no longer any structure for legislature corruption. There is no long any structure for 49% of the voters to be denied their choice. The need to give decision makers an exam, as noted in a comment below, is no longer even in the picture.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first challenge that comes up is, of course, how does this address what appear to be single option decisions? For example: should we build a bridge or not? Should we go to war? Should a shopping mall be allowed a permit? But in each of these &quot;apparent&quot; single option cases, they are not so single optioned. Take the U.S. and the current ISIS disaster. This does not have to be treated like a single issue. Sure, there's the &quot;bomb them&quot; crowd. Let them vote to do that. Remember, there's a price tag. So, each &quot;bomb&quot; vote might have a $50,000 price tag that the voter must commit to pay. The vote, however, would also allow the &quot;negotiate&quot; voters to chose their option, which may have a different cost, like $2,000. HOWEVER, this process would also allow voters who want to approach the problem through &quot;humanitarian aid&quot; to choose that option, and select from a range of support costs: $100, $500, $1000, &quot;pick your contribution&quot;. This last option makes it clear that we have to approach this new world with totally different thinking. What is the &quot;value&quot; for a voter in choosing a $100 support package vs. $1000? Do they get future travel vouchers to the war area after it recovers? Maybe business vouchers? This will surely force us to be smarter about what we are doing.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> E.g. everyone creates one multiple choice question and publishes it with correct answer. 200 questions are randomly taken for the exam for potential decision-makers. The best 5 decision-makers than decide the thing that needs to be decided.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It may have some interesting advantages. It may force people into thinking and studying. It may take specialist into decision making too. There are no official boundaries and it is still localized. No age limit.  The question do not need to be translated. If we select randomly the decision makers from top 10% in the exam, the motivation may rise. It can be tuned or mixed with existing structures for better results and easier transition.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still I should e.g. think more how make public sector respect the decisions and how to allocate resources for the decisions.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here i am coming from a view point that voting is not as important as useful discussions on a decision.  More idiots talking is not improvement and more anger leads only to desire but not to understanding or love that gives hope.  In spiritual structures love is the big item but see David deutsch.  And in others hope is the big item which tends around Christian flocks.  And expectation is big around say theosophy in the Erickson thread.

I tend to think of using the NSA dataset (very expensive to access) to translate between the value structures in a way that avoids the nose punches via a kind of censorship.  Sometimes I am a nice guy and so I think of an interactive conversation between the submitter and the dataset until both the dataset and the submitter reach an agreement.
