<PRE>Hi Mark,

I have just started working on one tiny part of the app (which is partly 
why I will not be spending much time chatting). I agree with you: we 
need the app to start using it.

</I>&gt;<i>         of a stretch to go directly from where we are currently to
</I>&gt;<i>         there without any intermediate steps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So you say. I say: putting *any* sort of significantly new social
</I>&gt;<i>     policy or sub-system directly into service in the real world
</I>&gt;<i>     without first testing and developing it and comparing it
</I>&gt;<i>     extensively &quot;in the laboratory&quot; would be foolish, and reasonable
</I>&gt;<i>     people will -- for good reason -- be highly unlikely to agree to
</I>&gt;<i>     such a course of action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     We now have technologies available that enable us to
</I>&gt;<i>     collaboratively create (if we choose) an online Virtual Worlds
</I>&gt;<i>     game/environment, that can be as realistic as it needs to be (from
</I>&gt;<i>     the perspective of fully implementing, testing, demonstrating,
</I>&gt;<i>     comparing, and popularizing new social system visions).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Now that the possibility exists to create a near-perfect
</I>&gt;<i>     laboratory environment within which to test and compare social
</I>&gt;<i>     system visions, I take it to be utterly irresponsible for anyone
</I>&gt;<i>     to suggest that *ANY* significant social system change be made in
</I>&gt;<i>     the real world without first testing it, demonstrating it, and
</I>&gt;<i>     comparing it in that laboratory environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In ThePlan (page 77, as part of the implementation schedule), you
</I>&gt;<i>     express one piece of this idea:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Design and implement &quot;virtual world&quot; simulations of The Plan,
</I>&gt;<i>         and test them to find exploits and to help refine reasonable
</I>&gt;<i>         Goals and preliminary tax rates (i.e., these might be games
</I>&gt;<i>         like SimCity or Second Life, but with challenges from the
</I>&gt;<i>         real-world thrown in such as natural and human-caused
</I>&gt;<i>         disasters, child-rearing, sickness/accidents/deaths, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i>         Develop and test military and international political
</I>&gt;<i>         simulations to help refine Planish policies and tactics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     What is missing from this passage is the understanding that the
</I>&gt;<i>     social system of The Plan (fully operational and operating in its
</I>&gt;<i>     own virtual world) must experimentally prove itself against other
</I>&gt;<i>     bright new visions (each also fully operational and operating in
</I>&gt;<i>     its own virtual world), in order to legitimately win the hearts
</I>&gt;<i>     and minds of the general public. (We are talking science, Baby!
</I>&gt;<i>     The scientific method fully embraces competition among competing
</I>&gt;<i>     visions, with those competitions settled on the field of actual
</I>&gt;<i>     experimentation, not just on the field of listserv word-wars,
</I>&gt;<i>     Loomio votes, or propaganda/advertising campaigns.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So, with all of the foregoing as preamble, let us revisit your
</I>&gt;<i>     criticism of The Prime Directive, of Blinap, and of Isonomea:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Scott wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>         I like the way this is totally outside the box (doesn't even

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Your hypothesis is that it would/will be &quot;better&quot; (the metrics of
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;better&quot; are unspecified) for us (humanity) to take an
</I>&gt;<i>     intermediate step first (that is, real-world implementation of
</I>&gt;<i>     ThePlan) and then at some unspecified time after that to take
</I>&gt;<i>     further steps (to adopt The Prime Directive and implement
</I>&gt;<i>     Blinap/Isonomea, or whatever).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Your formulation of the hypothesis omits the possibility of doing
</I>&gt;<i>     all of this sort of research (testing these sorts of comparative
</I>&gt;<i>     hypotheses) in our virtual worlds laboratory, before taking any
</I>&gt;<i>     steps at all with respect to real-world social systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I suggest to you that it is both good science and good engineering
</I>&gt;<i>     to test first (in the laboratory), and only *after* thorough
</I>&gt;<i>     comparative testing in the laboratory to then propose implementing
</I>&gt;<i>     *anything* in the real world.
