<PRE>On Sun, Oct 12, 2014 at 4:30 PM, Ned Conner &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">npconner at earthlink.net</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; For those of us who are privy to only a single real world, this &quot;run

</I>
Depends on how you measure &quot;quality&quot;: For example, if our new People's
Congress decides not to spend 2 trillion dollars on a new nuclear
submarine fleet (as our &quot;real&quot; congress has), we don't really need a
virtual world simulation that shows conclusively how many shipbuilding
jobs won't happen or how much our taxes will go down.  Merely being
able to conclusively state that cancelling that project represents the
Will of The People is all the &quot;quality&quot; we need.

&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; Scientists do research in laboratories for good reason. The real world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is exceedingly messy; extraneous factors abound. We can learn better and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> faster through experiments run in controlled environments, and through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experiments that can be run to completion in parallel to allow comparison
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> among results. Implementing parallel decisions on parallel virtual worlds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would enable this.
</I>
Agreed.  But it may simply be a luxury (or perhaps a marketing tool)
we can't afford.  To some extent we have to rely on faith that a
direct democracy is superior to a representative democracy and act
(and convince other people to act) accordingly.  The economic
simulations I propose in The Plan I think are much less ambitious than
what you are proposing.  We'll be able to determine whether or not
people can game the system with only a few dozen participants in a
very primitive virtual world (I'm thinking something along the lines
of the first generation of Sim City or Warcraft).  The primary reason
for doing more would be to use that data for marketing.  But I'm
inclined to think we'll be a lot more successful marketing the new
system as a religion than marketing it the way you would paper towels
(independent research shows that it's 50% less corrupt than ordinary
governments!)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Scott&gt; I would assume adoption of the new system would be from small
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (HOAs, school boards, etc.) to large, but even this is not necessary. My
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> belief is we could set up a system that would provide better results than
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the US congress relatively easily, for example ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; You would be able to show that your alternative decision system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> produced different decisions, but you would not be able to show that those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different decisions produced &quot;better&quot; results. For that, you would need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implement each decision in its own parallel virtual world, and then measure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and compare the results produced by the decisions. (And also, Congress and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Scott's The System&quot; are not the only two dogs in the race -- you keep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forgetting that. Your main competition is not Congress.)
</I>
No, obviously the main competition is skepticism and apathy.  But,
again, I think you're setting the bar too high: We don't have to have
a &quot;best buy&quot; rating from Consumer Reports to be successful, everyone
knows the existing systems have serious problems, all we need to do is
provide a legitimate alternative and market it properly to win.

&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; I take your parsing of the problem domain to be one of the problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *in* that problem domain. You seem to think that &quot;government&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision-matters are cleanly distinguishable from &quot;economic&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision-matters, from &quot;environmental&quot; decision-matters, and so on. Really?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you do think that, please explain the distinguishing principles to me. (I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would have thought that substantive &quot;government&quot; decisions inevitably have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economic and environmental effects, and that it is precisely through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comparing those effects that we will be able to select/synthesize our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;better than Congress&quot; decision system.)
</I>
You're right, of course.  Theoretically.  Then again, I still believe
that Marx was right, theoretically.  Turns out he didn't understand
human nature, which turns out to be necessary out in the real world.
Changing both our political and economic systems at the same time IMHO
is just one of those things that people won't be willing to do.
Fortunately we can fix the majority of the problems we face, and maybe
almost all of them, by merely fixing the political system.

&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; (And also, &quot;metagovernment&quot; means &quot;more than just government&quot;, just as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;metaphysics&quot; means &quot;more than just physics&quot;. It means examining and dealing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the larger/deeper context in which the field is embedded. You want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;metagovernment.org&quot; to be just &quot;government.org&quot;. But perpetuating such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;silo thinking&quot; is (I suggest) precisely what we do not need at this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> juncture of human history.)
</I>
I wouldn't propose to exclude economic systems from the list of
subjects we can discuss here.  I'm just saying that my position in the
debate is that this group has enough on its plate without that....

&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; You (correctly) see that &quot;economic decisions&quot; produce effects when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented, and that we need to determine and compare those effects in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order to make informed choices among alternative economic systems. Oddly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you apparently do not see that &quot;government decisions&quot; also produce effects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when implemented, and that we need to determine and compare those effects in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order to make informed choices among alternative governance systems.
</I>
Again, it's not that I don't *see* it, it's just than I'm an engineer
by nature and so I'd rather get an imperfect or incomplete system
actually implemented than design a perfect one that only exists in
theory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Scott&gt; This is *not* the purpose of metagovernment.org. Maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;metaeconomics.org&quot; or &quot;metacapitalism.org&quot; or something ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; Here again is what appears to me to be &quot;silo thinking&quot;. To try to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> punch holes in those silos (to release those trapped), I will say this: the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> term &quot;democratic capitalism&quot; is internally contradictory.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; Each and every time that a capitalist or a corporation makes a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public-matter decision (that is, a decision that will affect not just the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capitalist or corporation), democracy has been usurped. From the perspective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of public-matter decision making, democracy and capitalism are mutually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exclusive alternatives.
</I>
Again, I agree with you *in theory*.  But as a practical matter my
inclination is that the two are compatible enough that we don't have
to change both systems at the same time, especially when changing just
the political system fixes most of the problems we face with the
economic system (it being used to game the political system being by
far the biggest of these, with inequality being a distant second, and
all the other problems (inefficiency, negative impacts on morale,
etc.) being almost negligible).

&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; Moreover (warm fuzzy fairy tales aside), the most successful actual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capitalists are generally strongly opposed to democratic influences, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will do what they can to neutralize and override such influences,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particularly with respect to their own plans and interests. (I wonder if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most successful capitalists are typically SDAs ...)
</I>
Oh, they definitely are.  As are the best military personnel, and
possibly even the best bureaucrats.  This isn't a problem, though, and
may even be an advantage because it enables them to perform those
roles better than neurotypicals: It's restricting SDA influence on the
*political* system that has to be our major concern because that's
where their prejudice and irrationality are causing the most serious
problems.

&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; Bottom Line: Continuing to trust &quot;The Invisible Hand&quot; to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public-matter decisions will very likely produce the result that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> biosphere will be rendered unsuitable for human habitation. (But what do we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> care -- we are not environmentalists, we are only concerned with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government.)
</I>
Don't get me wrong, I'm an environmentalist too, but IMHO the solution
to a degrading environment isn't the government (as it exists) and
especially isn't the economic system.  It's primarily a religious
issue: The People have to *believe* that dealing it with is the right
thing to do.  Once that is in place, it pretty much doesn't matter
which government or economic system you have in place as the necessary
changes will be made.  But this is why it's not something I think it's
necessary or productive to discuss here even though allowance for it
should be part of all of our system designs: Metagovernment for me is
not a religious or marketing organization and so I'd prefer to
concentrate on more nuts-and-bolts kinds of things here.

    Scott
