This will be (is being) driven by the same shift in consciousness that bring all of us to this list&#8230;.and will be built on the bits and pieces now developing among us.

&gt;<i> You seem to have completely ignored the fact

</I>&gt;<i> most significant of these: There *are* no poor, undereducated,
</I>&gt;<i> disabled, old, very young, mentally ill, or otherwise disadvantaged
</I>&gt;<i> individuals at Valve so they are simply spared the difficult decisions
</I>&gt;<i> about how they're going to provide for those people.
</I>
Resource distribution decisions are made routinely by corporations. One could even say they are very good at making them...(and probably for better at it than any government). The issue is that (for the most part) the mission of the corporate model is based on a fairly narrow or short sighted self-interest.  (resource distribution for the organization)  As we continue to understand our connection and interdependence at a global scale, I believe we&#8230;(the makers and owners of corporations) will continue to respond commensurate to this realization.

&gt;<i> You've *also* made two other fundamental mistakes.  The first is the
</I>&gt;<i> assumption that cooperation is a viable alternative to competition as
</I>&gt;<i> a governing principle except in extremely homogeneous domains.  
</I>
What happens when a group of competitive individuals comes to the realization that it is in their best interest to cooperate? I would say that they begin to form an &quot;extremely homogeneous domain&#8221;.   Unless they are just plain stupid&#8230;.in which case they continue to complete and ultimately destroy themselves and their environment.  Oh well, it&#8217;s a huge universe.  No great loss.

&gt;<i> This is just wrong, as been shown countless times in countless areas.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> against human (and indeed animal) nature, something we ignore at our
</I>&gt;<i> peril.  
</I>
Our world is incredibly complex and continually evolving.  We are positioned at the vanguard of this endeavor.  Why hang on so to historical interpretations of our capabilities?  Why limit *us* to such a baseline prescription of possibility?  

&gt;<i> People simply don't follow laws that they
</I>&gt;<i> consider immoral, and while we can count on a certain amount of help
</I>&gt;<i> from human's instinctive conceptions of fairness (which other animals
</I>&gt;<i> share, telling us that it's a deeply embedded one), you can't
</I>&gt;<i> legislate morality which is what your proposal, and any sort of
</I>&gt;<i> cooperative design, would require.
</I>
If people &quot;simply don&#8217;t follow laws they consider immoral&quot;&#8230;.then we won&#8217;t need to &quot;legislate morality&#8221;&#8230;.will we?  :)

&gt;<i> Like morality, you can't legislate altruism, or educate it into
</I>&gt;<i> people, which is something your Cooperative model requires.
</I>&gt;<i> Particularly when it not only fails to meet the morality requirements
</I>&gt;<i> but also lacks simple engineering efficiency (e.g., the pace of
</I>&gt;<i> development and improvement in a domain is highly correlated with the
</I>&gt;<i> degree of competition).
</I>
I&#8217;m not interested in legislating anything. I&#8217;m just connecting the dots that I *see*.  It&#8217;s a totally subjective exercise. From my orientation, the real world is far too big and complex for any of us to accurately describe given our very limited (human) architecture. In my mind, it&#8217;s a bit foolish to frame what we see as truth (especially if we label it in terms of right or wrong).  It&#8217;s all our *story*&#8230;. narratives upon narratives of our very limited perceptions and ensuing interpretations.   

And given that how we *see* has some effect on what (seems to) show up&#8230;why not see, or imagine, or tell the best story possible?  

Or conversely, why hang on to such a limited perception of our (or really your) nature.  When it comes down to it&#8230;.it&#8217;s all projection.   Quantum science has *proven* that.  :)


&gt;&gt;<i> As together we choose, together it will be.  :)
</I>
&gt;<i> Problem is, we need a better system *now* even if we can't *all* agree
</I>&gt;<i> on it.  
</I>
I agree. 

&gt;<i> If 25% of the population has to get dragged into a new thing
</I>&gt;<i> that they're just instinctively not comfortable with, well, we just
</I>&gt;<i> need to ease their pain as much as possible without allowing them a
</I>&gt;<i> blocking vote.  Insisting on &quot;consensus&quot; or &quot;consent&quot; from them is
</I>&gt;<i> just another way of guaranteeing preservation of the status quo.
</I>
You can lead a horse to water&#8230;.but you can&#8217;t make them drink.
And if they don&#8217;t drink&#8230;what happens?
