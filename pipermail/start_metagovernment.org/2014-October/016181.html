</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I consider what needs to happen for us to avoid the myriad of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> looming catastrophes, and the timing within which it needs to happen, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think that developing a platform *outside* the constraints of contemporary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political, religious, and economic structures&#8230;one that can skillfully focus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on very specific solutions...is our only realistic hope.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Creating renewable energy technologies, replanting forests, educating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> children in third world countries, (and so on), isn't dependent on regional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or global politics and economics so much as it is on the creative focus of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individuals, and smalls groups like us.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What Elon Musk and his team have done for humanity and the environment,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in just a few brief years, is way beyond what any polity has been able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accomplish through elected representation. The initiative the X-Prize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> foundation is launching for the education of illiterate children around the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world will have a far greater cascade (in so many different domains) than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any initiative the U.N. is capable of forwarding toward that end.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my mind, the only way we will bring about real *transformation*,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requisite to both the timing and scale of urgency we are facing, is by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developing an entirely new model/structure/process/platform for human
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evolution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think we must begin building something that can empower a very large
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of people, (and organizations), in a very short period of time.  If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we involve contemporary political, religious, and economic institutions, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are just asking for (more of the same) delay and dysfunction&#8230;..too much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entrenched polarity, negative momentum, greed, distrust, and apathy.  The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current system is a dinosaur.  In my mind, the sooner we let go the better.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe we could begin this effort by looking at what *really* needs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to happen and when. If we ask, 'what are our fundamental priorities?', I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don&#8217;t think creating better systems of governance is tops on the list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would be nice...but how long will *that* take?  I&#8217;d rather focus on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advancing permaculture as an alternative to commercial agribusiness in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order to save the bees, or towards developing technologies for cleaning up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the mess that BP has left us with in the Gulf of Mexico, or providing water
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filtration systems for the billion or so people that live without potable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> water on a daily basis, &#8230;&#8230;and so on.  Those are issues that really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> matter&#8230;.to all of us.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my mind, the *only* thing that will get the job done, from where we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are currently positioned, is a very large segment of the population
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> empowered to work synergistically towards solutions that connect us and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide for the whole of life. We *don&#8217;t* need a *democracy* to do these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things.  We just need to create a platform that&#8217;s crowdsourced and funded,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> horizontal, and self-organizing.  One that is set it up to evolve and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sustain it&#8217;s own process without a hierarchy determining it&#8217;s orientation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and administration.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the not to distant future the smart phone will be our ballot box and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we&#8217;ll be making decisions globally through a hybridized social network.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Corporations will be member owned and operate with a charter that has a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heart and soul.  They will manage the infrastructure of our society.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Politicians will fade into the dark history of our troubled adolescence.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The singularity is near.  I say, let&#8217;s create something (together) that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has the potential to move us to the stars&#8230;.without leaving a wake of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> destruction on this lovely, beautiful planet we call home.  :)
