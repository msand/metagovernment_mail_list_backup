Current draft of my book is always available at
<A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf">http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf</A>

That version is 0.4 and I'm busy on 0.5.  The intro and the
organization of government isn't much different between the two, but
the new version has greatly expanded sections on education and
child-rearing (including lots more references) and a new section on
the relationship between laws and moral codes.  I'm also working on
some more meta-level projects including converting it from a book
(which apparently people don't read anymore ;-)  into a web site and a
renaming project for some of the key components.

&gt;<i> Do you support direct democracy with proxies ? How do you create topics and
</I>&gt;<i> how do you prioritize them ?
</I>
Yes, and I'm not inclined to produce a general discussion forum
(though I'd like to keep the design flexible enough to allow for that)
but instead concentrate on the actual business of making law and
policy.  Which means someone first produces a *complete* proposal
(like a bill in congress) which people then attach their comments and
suggested revisions to.  FB/Reddit/Slashdot/etc. aren't organized this
way, but that's because they're for entertainment purposes.  As a
replacement-government project we actually need to get stuff done, not
just facilitate endless chatter.  The opposite the of goals of those
sites, in a real governing system if you don't have anything useful to
contribute, STFU, although you can of course vote on the completely
analysed proposal at the end.

&gt;<i> Could you compare your ideas with WPE <A HREF="http://www.tgde.org/">http://www.tgde.org/</A> ?
</I>
I believe before you try to tackle my stuff you really need to
understand Authoritarianism and the best way to do that is to read Bob
Altemeyer's book (yeah, I realize that this runs smack into that
&quot;nobody reads books anymore&quot; problem ;-)
<A HREF="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/">http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/</A>

Doing that you will gain an appreciation for why I believe that any
representative-based government is fatally flawed: The people that
rise to serve in those types of systems are just inherently incapable
of doing the job properly.  It's just the nature of their
personalities which I think is made astoundingly clear in Altemeyer's
Global Change Game experiment, which I rank up there with the Milgram
experiment in terms of its importance.  Unfortunately it has received
less than a ten-thousandth as much coverage, IMHO mostly because of
political correctness issues (i.e., singling out 25% of the population
as the source of the majority of our problems just goes against the
zeitgeist, unlike Milgram which purports to show that everyone could
become a Nazi which for some reason is so much more comforting ;-)

    Scott
