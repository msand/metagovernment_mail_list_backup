<PRE>Pietro, I find this intro on sociocracy pretty good:
<A HREF="http://governance.server306.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Creative-Forces-of-Self-Organization1.pdf.">http://governance.server306.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Creative-Forces-of-Self-Organization1.pdf.</A>
It might help you, but also should help everyone else.

Some important takes on whats been said...

[Jacopo]&gt;Please, in trying to make sense of all this super-interesting
discussion I ask if someone can confirm my understanding:
[Jacopo]&gt;1 sociocracy without hierarchy is very close if not equal to
direct democracy?
[Pietro]&gt;Absolutely not. DIrect democracy is based on voting, and doing
what the majority wants. Sociocracy uses a different system not related
with voting.
[Scott]&gt;Umm, I think the proposal was to keep the social organization of
[Scott]&gt;sociocracy but add some sort of global decisionmaking option (i.e.,
a
[Scott]&gt;vote, as in direct democracy).  In which case my claim (and I think
[Scott]&gt; Gustav's) is that it's not sociocracy anymore....

Pietro is correct in  a way, although in sociocracy the members of each
circle (subgroup of the community) are entirely free to decide a matter
through voting if no one objects to it. They are actually free to decide
which kind of decision-making model they will use for each process within
the circle, as long as no one objects to it. For instance, they may decide
that Jacopo will have sole and full decision authority for fixing toilets.
Therefore, it is also entirely possible within the sociocratic organization
for people to establish that certain matters should only be decided through
referendum voting of all people inside the community, or any other kind of
decision-making process. The trick is that anyone within the circle still
retains the right to revoke any decision taken, if there is a sensible and
argued objection.

For instance, if Scott decides that Jacopo is taking too long to solve the
issue of fixing the mirror of the toilet, then he may bring the subject in
the next meeting and should also come up with an alternative way of dealing
with the problem. Jacopo will tell the reason for the delay and the group
will discuss the situation. In the end Scott may take back his alternative
proposal, or the group (including Jacopo and Scott) will decide for an
alternative way of dealing with toilet fixing that no one really objects to
it (in the sense that everyone can live with that decision, not in the
sense that everyone agrees that the solution is the optimal one).

Thus, sociocracy offers a lot of freedom to choose what and how to do
stuff, while still retaining the right for anyone in the community to ask
for a decision revocation if they have rational objections. It takes more
time than usual for decisions to take place, but that's also why certain
decisions are more often than not being delegated (while still being
continuously analyzed and - if necessary - reviewed by the community).
Which is fine by me.



[Jacopo]&gt; 2 does direct democracy need executive officers? Because if it
does I did not understand even what Direct Democracy is!
It doesn't really. I may be wrong, but I believe that Athenian direct
democracy was a social system which had a very different way of dealing
with the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary powers activities seen
nowadays. Anyway, I think different people will define direct democracy in
different ways, the common ground being that it should be a kind of social
organization model where people directly participate as much as possible in
the political decisions of the community. I think it is not out of the
realm of possibility that these decisions could extend into activities of
what we know as the Executive and Judiciary powers. However, the usual way
that people refers to direct democracy nowadays is that it should
substitute the representative system observed within the Legislative power.



[Max]&gt; My.  I will trump your scientism with my pythogorian mysticism.
 Woo.  Woo.
[Scott]&gt;I'm thinking this isn't playing fair: Unless you're going to reject
[Scott]&gt;science as the basis of engineering

Scott, although I believe a lot of the sociocratic model comes more from
empirical evidence of trial and error within the business management area,
it has also a lot of its background from scientifically studied theories of
complex systems, such as those from cybernetics. It's principles tries to
mimic, or at least come in agreement with, reality-based self-organizing
complex systems (be it chemical, biological or social, although each one is
in an entirely different category in terms of complexity). Thus, it tries
to be a &quot;natural&quot; system of organization of complex systems, which is what
human communities are. It is far from perfect, but so is humanity. I
believe there is no scientific chest of gold to be found after the rainbow
for governance systems. Thare are only acceptable governance systems around
which each community can agree to follow (or not!). There is some history
background on sociocracy on the link above.

Also, sociocracy was formulated as a system for organizing a very real (and
somewhat successful) business, and it is being used today within very real
businesses (with varying degrees of success, I would believe). But I am not
sure how it would translate into a governance system in the public sector,
as I have no experience whatsoever with that. As a public sector employee
myself I believe it would be very very hard, because I think it would
require an extensive change in mindset from too many people for it to
really work...

However, it should work really well for organizations such as
Metagovernment!  :)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Axiom of choice says every collection is a set.  If this applies to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mundane world then every arbitrary collection is not only homogeneous
</I>&gt;<i> but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; includes all the items that are homogeneous, excluding none improperly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In theory: In practice you'll find that a randomly chosen &quot;set&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i> people are pretty much non-homogeneous in their political outlook and
</I>&gt;<i> behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suppose I need to say the axiom does have physical reality.  But the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; matter is a bit complex.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But all the collections you will come across are homogeneous and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understanding and usefulness of this is limited by the computational
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capability of the universe.  Notice that the word in question then become
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meaningless in scientism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As this whole exercise is for the purposes of engineering...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You might want to think about how 5000 people can get together and reach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus by treating that as outside of scientism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, it's in the realm of fantasy or wishful thinking.  Unless maybe
</I>&gt;<i> they're all members of a religious cult or something, in which case
</I>&gt;<i> homogeneity is enforced by cultural norms (as indeed it was in the
</I>&gt;<i> soviets).  My proposal is that we're not cultural engineers, nor
</I>&gt;<i> should we aspire to be: We need to design systems that work with
</I>&gt;<i> people as they come to it, not try to change them to fit the system.
</I>&gt;<i> Which is what I see the consent/consensus aficionados trying to do.
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone is following that debate on the AG list (a German list for
</I>&gt;<i> the Pirate Party) you'll appreciate the irony of how subgroups intent
</I>&gt;<i> on developing consensus-based systems are hoist by their own petard.
