</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The ability to have a rational discussion about religion or morals

I like the brain scan idea (as used in my book) better.  You can
actually see the activation in the amygdala (the emotional center of
the brain) is more highly activated in authoritarians (usually
described as &quot;social conservatives&quot; in these studies) in situations
where a situation calls for making a decision that involves a conflict
between the rational and emotional modes of operation.  But I only
prescribe this technique for distinguishing sexual orientation
(particularly pedophiles) as a condition of their marriage or
employment, not for trying to exclude authoritarians from voting
because I consider the latter to be impractical and potentially even
dangerous WRT social stability.

&gt;<i> I see your honorable goal of making government easy. On the other hand I see
</I>&gt;<i> that we cannot consider universe or just the known nature easy. I do not see
</I>&gt;<i> how can be doing good decisions in this universe easy.
</I>
I agree my proposal is far from ideal.  But it does have two advantages:
1) It's way better than the current system because it bypasses the
whole corruption issue (same with most direct democracy proposals),
and as a bonus drastically reduces the influence of authoritarians
(not usually a feature in most direct democracy systems, which tend
toward your mericracy philosophy which would allow them through the
filter).
2) It's implementable.  Which is important because even if it's only a
stepping stone on the way to a better system, at least it gets us out
of the hole we're currently in.

&gt;<i> The idea of outvoting seems to be easiest for this purpose. If I would like
</I>&gt;<i> to arrange something like that I would select random people (for
</I>&gt;<i> effectiveness), test them as socially acceptable and finally let them vote
</I>&gt;<i> with Condorcet.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think ?
</I>
This is actually discussed in my book.  It's a proposal that's been
rattling around political science for decades (I remember a poly sci
prof of mine seriously recommending this back in 1980 or so).  The big
problem is that it's impractical to get a truly random sample because
of self selection biases, i.e., authoritarians will put their names on
the list and then volunteer to serve when called, whereas
neurotypicals will avoid both.  It'll be like jury duty, where anyone
with half a brain can get out of serving with a few well chosen words.
For example, I was called a few months ago for a multi-day drug trial,
and when I answered the question about what I do in my spare time I
gave an outline of the book I'm working on and was instantly excused
for cause by the judge.  I actually expected to make it through the
first round and then be excluded by the prosecutor (I also have a PhD,
which is something prosecutors try to avoid because apparently we tend
to cause hung juries), but it didn't even come to that.

The second problem is the relatively poor level of education of our
populations, particularly WRT probability and statistics, lack of
awareness of our instinctive miscalibration when it comes to
low-probability events, and our blindness of our tendencies towards
superstition and conspiracy theories.  IMHO even though a truly random
sampling system (like Blinap) is far superior to any mass-voting
system both in terms of efficiency and in terms of inherent bias, The
People I think won't be ready for such a system until they become much
better educated and have considerable hands-on experience with
automated voting and budgeting systems.
  Regards,
    Scott
