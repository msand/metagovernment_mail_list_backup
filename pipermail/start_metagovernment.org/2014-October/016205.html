I think this concept is subsumed under &quot;meritocracy&quot;, although as I
point out in my book whoever created that word did it wrong: It should
I think be &quot;mericracy&quot;.

&gt;<i> ok, what authoritarians do not want to do in order to get power ?

The ability to have a rational discussion about religion or morals
would be a great filter.  For example I'm working on a moral code
section for my book and ran across this page on Richard Dawkins' site:
<A HREF="https://richarddawkins.net/2014/07/are-there-emotional-no-go-areas-where-logic-dare-not-show-its-face/">https://richarddawkins.net/2014/07/are-there-emotional-no-go-areas-where-logic-dare-not-show-its-face/</A>

Unfortunately he I think doesn't recognize authoritarian behavior when
he sees it and so goes off on a tangent about people generally not
being able to think clearly when in fact the problem is much more
localized than that.

But I'd say the odds of being able to impose a system that filters
like this (including your mericracy example) are very low because
authoritarians and social dominators wouldn't stand for it. And
unfortunately those are exactly the kinds of people you don't want to
screw with because they will have no qualms about establishing a
&quot;Fourth Reich&quot; via violent overthrow of the government if they're
pushed.  Which is why my proposal is to drown them in Neurotypical
input instead: They are a minority after all and it's fair game to
override their prejudice with the will of the moderate majority of the
population, at least as long as you're willing to concede that
consensus is not a viable decision rule.  The only trick there is
making the system easy (i.e., efficient) enough that they can run the
government with a modest investment of time (my target is an hour a
week).

    Scott
