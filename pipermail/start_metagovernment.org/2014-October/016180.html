<PRE>Metagovernment weeds out all religion to a degree and runs on pure
logistics an actual vote on the affected area. so if that area has a
certain religious set of views it will follow suit without any predejust.
but areas where atheism rules the same applies. logistics rule. its pure
perfection. if every human being has equal say no one can really complain
it is true equality.

</I>&gt;<i> When I consider what needs to happen for us to avoid the myriad of looming
</I>&gt;<i> catastrophes, and the timing within which it needs to happen, I think that
</I>&gt;<i> developing a platform *outside* the constraints of contemporary political,
</I>&gt;<i> religious, and economic structures...one that can skillfully focus on very
</I>&gt;<i> specific solutions...is our only realistic hope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Creating renewable energy technologies, replanting forests, educating
</I>&gt;<i> children in third world countries, (and so on), isn't dependent on regional
</I>&gt;<i> or global politics and economics so much as it is on the creative focus of
</I>&gt;<i> individuals, and smalls groups like us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What Elon Musk and his team have done for humanity and the environment, in
</I>&gt;<i> just a few brief years, is way beyond what any polity has been able to
</I>&gt;<i> accomplish through elected representation. The initiative the X-Prize
</I>&gt;<i> foundation is launching for the education of illiterate children around the
</I>&gt;<i> world will have a far greater cascade (in so many different domains) than
</I>&gt;<i> any initiative the U.N. is capable of forwarding toward that end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my mind, the only way we will bring about real *transformation*,
</I>&gt;<i> requisite to both the timing and scale of urgency we are facing, is by
</I>&gt;<i> developing an entirely new model/structure/process/platform for human
</I>&gt;<i> evolution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we must begin building something that can empower a very large
</I>&gt;<i> number of people, (and organizations), in a very short period of time.  If
</I>&gt;<i> we involve contemporary political, religious, and economic institutions, we
</I>&gt;<i> are just asking for (more of the same) delay and dysfunction.....too much
</I>&gt;<i> entrenched polarity, negative momentum, greed, distrust, and apathy.  The
</I>&gt;<i> current system is a dinosaur.  In my mind, the sooner we let go the better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe we could begin this effort by looking at what *really* needs to
</I>&gt;<i> happen and when. If we ask, 'what are our fundamental priorities?', I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think creating better systems of governance is tops on the list. Would be
</I>&gt;<i> nice...but how long will *that* take?  I'd rather focus on advancing
</I>&gt;<i> permaculture as an alternative to commercial agribusiness in order to save
</I>&gt;<i> the bees, or towards developing technologies for cleaning up the mess that
</I>&gt;<i> BP has left us with in the Gulf of Mexico, or providing water filtration
</I>&gt;<i> systems for the billion or so people that live without potable water on a
</I>&gt;<i> daily basis, ......and so on.  Those are issues that really matter....to all of
</I>&gt;<i> us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my mind, the *only* thing that will get the job done, from where we
</I>&gt;<i> are currently positioned, is a very large segment of the population
</I>&gt;<i> empowered to work synergistically towards solutions that connect us and
</I>&gt;<i> provide for the whole of life. We *don't* need a *democracy* to do these
</I>&gt;<i> things.  We just need to create a platform that's crowdsourced and funded,
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal, and self-organizing.  One that is set it up to evolve and
</I>&gt;<i> sustain it's own process without a hierarchy determining it's orientation
</I>&gt;<i> and administration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the not to distant future the smart phone will be our ballot box and
</I>&gt;<i> we'll be making decisions globally through a hybridized social network.
</I>&gt;<i> Corporations will be member owned and operate with a charter that has a
</I>&gt;<i> heart and soul.  They will manage the infrastructure of our society.
</I>&gt;<i> Politicians will fade into the dark history of our troubled adolescence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The singularity is near.  I say, let's create something (together) that
</I>&gt;<i> has the potential to move us to the stars....without leaving a wake of
</I>&gt;<i> destruction on this lovely, beautiful planet we call home.  :)
