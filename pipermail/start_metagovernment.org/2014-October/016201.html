I've just read the relevant sections of Bruce's book (he'll send it to
you if you ask) which contain a lot more information on this proposal.
But I must admit I still don't see how it would work for most
real-world examples.

&gt;<i> The first challenge that comes up is, of course, how does this address what
</I>&gt;<i> appear to be single option decisions? For example: should we build a bridge
</I>&gt;<i> or not? Should we go to war? Should a shopping mall be allowed a permit? But
</I>&gt;<i> in each of these &quot;apparent&quot; single option cases, they are not so single

</I>&gt;<i> them vote to do that. Remember, there's a price tag. So, each &quot;bomb&quot; vote
</I>&gt;<i> might have a $50,000 price tag that the voter must commit to pay.
</I>
Still not getting it.  War is generally a kind of thing that these
sorts of piecemeal solutions don't really work as Vietnam, the Korean
war, and the first Gulf war I think clearly show: By failing to follow
through all you do is make the situation worse.  Damaging 20% of
ISIS's capability to make war is only going to piss them off and make
*us* a target.  But the bridge example is maybe better: Do you propose
to make only part of a bridge, or scale it down to only support
pedestrian traffic in hopes of getting consensus?

There's another problem, not discussed in the example above but
covered in detail in the book: The design calls for representative
government to find these multi-modal solutions.  These are people who
have clearly demonstrated that they can barely make simple binary
choices.  How could we expect them to perform better by making their
job vastly more difficult?

The only way I can see this working is along the lines of toll-roads,
where those who can afford to pay (and also want to pay) get to pay
the bill in exchange for some service denied to everyone else.  IMHO
these types of things are heinous because they are inherently unfair
economically and generally inefficient to boot.  For example, you
ought to see the toll-roads around Denver: They're practically empty
even during rush hour, whereas the interstates are gridlocked (which
is why I use the toll roads only if I'm unable to arrange my trips to
avoid rush hour traffic, which fortunately I'm almost always able to
do).  The situation is worse in places like New Jersey where the toll
roads are primary sources of revenue, and they don't maintain (and
occasionally even randomly shut down) the alternative routes.  Why
people put up with this kind of abuse, I have no idea other than maybe
that they are just unaware that there are more efficient ways of doing
things.
  Regards,
    Scott
