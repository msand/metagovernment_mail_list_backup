I hope you're wrong, because I think we can't wait that long ;-)

&gt;<i> In a decade or two, I don&#8217;t think there will be much *government*, per say. That job will be (is being) taken over by the Corporate model of managing our affairs. The Corporate model will be taken over by the Cooperative model. The Cooperative model will run on a continually evolving platform/network/program/intelligence for managing the mission of our self-organization. The mission is *All for All*.  This will be (is being) driven by the same shift in consciousness that bring all of us to this list&#8230;.and will be built on the bits and pieces now developing among us.

No offense intended, but this strikes me as being naive to the point
of being delusional.  You seem to have completely ignored the fact
that Valve or any corporation simply doesn't have to deal with the
issues that we face when trying to enable the general population to
make better decisions.  Resource redistribution I consider to be the
most significant of these: There *are* no poor, undereducated,
disabled, old, very young, mentally ill, or otherwise disadvantaged
individuals at Valve so they are simply spared the difficult decisions
about how they're going to provide for those people.

You've *also* made two other fundamental mistakes.  The first is the
assumption that cooperation is a viable alternative to competition as
a governing principle except in extremely homogeneous domains.  This
is just wrong, as been shown countless times in countless areas.  It's
against human (and indeed animal) nature, something we ignore at our
peril.  Maybe think of your proposal as a type of prohibition, which
is another example of an &quot;enlightened&quot; principle that just never works
out in the real world.  People simply don't follow laws that they
consider immoral, and while we can count on a certain amount of help
from human's instinctive conceptions of fairness (which other animals
share, telling us that it's a deeply embedded one), you can't
legislate morality which is what your proposal, and any sort of
cooperative design, would require.

The second is the classic &quot;humans as a blank slate&quot; assumption that
sociologists are particularly prone to.  Unfortunately they've all
been proven wrong at every turn and this is in large part why
sociology in general is ranked at the very bottom of the social
sciences (which in turn are ranked at the bottom of all sciences) in
terms of prestige and perceived rigor and effectiveness.  The fact is
that sociocracy is just another feeble expression of this philosophy,
a watered-down Marxism that has no more chance of being successful
(and of course note that sociocracy *is* a product of sociologists).
Like morality, you can't legislate altruism, or educate it into
people, which is something your Cooperative model requires.
Particularly when it not only fails to meet the morality requirements
but also lacks simple engineering efficiency (e.g., the pace of
development and improvement in a domain is highly correlated with the
degree of competition).

&gt;<i> As together we choose, together it will be.  :)
</I>
Problem is, we need a better system *now* even if we can't *all* agree
on it.  If 25% of the population has to get dragged into a new thing
that they're just instinctively not comfortable with, well, we just
need to ease their pain as much as possible without allowing them a
blocking vote.  Insisting on &quot;consensus&quot; or &quot;consent&quot; from them is
just another way of guaranteeing preservation of the status quo.
  Regards,
    Scott
