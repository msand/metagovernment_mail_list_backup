Hey, better we think of them and design to account for them than to
have a new system fail after deployment....

&gt;<i> Imagine that you are planet manager (god) and your asset is a planet like
</I>&gt;<i> Earth.
</I>
Let me stop you right there: At least as it's described in the
Matchism manifesto, the managers serve at the discretion of The
People, not by Divine Right. In fact one of the items in my proposal
queue is &quot;Replace Donald Trump with Charlie Baker&quot; (Baker is the
Republican governor of Massachusetts and has maintained the highest
approval ratings among US governors over his two terms, whereas Trump
hasn't broken 50% and is unlikely to ever do that).

&gt;<i> If I imagine a job like that, my first idea when I look at the planet is:
</I>&gt;<i> Well, try to lower fertility and increase education with some mild means and
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully people will make peace, improve liberty, equality and
</I>&gt;<i> relationships.
</I>
Whether or not these things are related I think is pretty much
speculation at this point: Certainly the countries with the lowest
birth rates *aren't* doing the best overall. Japan, for example, is a
financial disaster exactly because they haven't balanced costs
associated with caring for (or at least appeasing) seniors with the
needs of younger people. IMHO the primary need to reduce the
population stems almost exclusively from the need to protect the
environment (which wasn't on your list).

&gt;<i> Now, tell me, why are we not looking for acceptable systems that will lower
</I>&gt;<i> fertility and increase education?
</I>
We have these already. The problem is that The People, who could (and
I believe would) push for greater adoption of these things if they
were forced to make the decisions themselves, have never been given
the opportunity to do so. Instead you've got SDAPs deciding to spend
the money on &quot;national defense&quot; and other programs designed to enrich
their cronies than on free birth control or a total redesign of our
educational systems.

&gt;<i> What would you do as planet manager?
</I>
The correct answer here is &quot;Implement The Will of The People&quot; ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
