<PRE>The new submission requirements and formatting/content guidelines for the UN 2.0 Challenge just arrived (finally):

<A HREF="https://globalchallenges.org/en/terms">https://globalchallenges.org/en/terms</A>

Some interesting changes:
1. Content and Format of Competition Entries

2.1 The Task
The participant must design a governance model able to effectively address the most pressing threats and risks to humanity. In other words, the task is not to come up with direct solutions to specific problems. Rather, it is to design a general model for decision-making, with the aim of generating such solutions and the ability to do so, and possessing the resources to effectively implement them.

The governance model must also be such that it can be implemented within the foreseeable future. This requires that it be acceptable to major states and the wider international community. A significant measure of civic acceptance is also required. This requirement eliminates models that rely on time-consuming and controversial changes in the political system of individual states, e.g. models that postulate that all states should be democracies

Furthermore, the governance model must involve a minimum of limitations to the sovereignty of nation-states, meaning that it should involve only such limitations as are necessary to ensure that national decisions do not seriously harm the vital interests of inhabitants of other countries, or of humanity as a whole. In other words, decisions within the governance model must not deal with the internal affairs of individual states.


2.2 Assessment criteria

(e) General Security

The governance model must guarantee international security and prevent disputes from escalating into war or other large-scale armed violence. Nations and ethnic groups must be guaranteed protection from external attack and must receive assistance in handling internal disputes fairly.

(e) Trust and Insight

The trust enjoyed by a successful governance model and its institutions relies on transparency and considerable insight into power structures and decision-making.

(f) Flexibility

AIn order to be able to fulfil its objectives effectively, a successful governance model must contain mechanisms that allow for revisions and improvements ofto be made to its structure and components.

(g) Protection against the Abuse of Power

A control system must be in place to take action if the organization oversteps its mandate, e.g. by unduly interfering with the internal affairs of nation states or favoring the special interests of individuals, groups, organizations, states or groups of states.

(h) Accountability and Transparency

It is a fundamental requirement of a successful governance model that it performs the tasks it has been charged with, and that decision-makers can be held accountable for their actions. This includes mechanisms against abuse of power, which can invalidate decisions and actions that exceed the mandate of the governance model, and which can step in when it is clear that decision-makers and relevant institutions are not doing their job correctly. This requires transparency and extensive insight into power structures and decision-making processesthe governance model must include the power to hold the decision-makers accountable for their actions.

</I>&gt;<i> This kind of hair-splitting goes on in the Open Source market all the

</I>&gt;<i> basically nothing the &quot;IP owner&quot; can do to prevent you from competing

</I>&gt;<i> retain some control over commercial use, but that'd also dramatically
</I>&gt;<i> shrink the potential market for the product (most companies won't
</I>&gt;<i> touch GPL licensed software).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This rule definitely applies to our purposes (i.e., creating a
</I>&gt;<i> decisionmaking system that is designed to replace some component of
</I>&gt;<i> actual government): No one is going to trust your system if they don't
</I>&gt;<i> have free reign to look at it, modify it, and fork it if necessary,
</I>&gt;<i> which requires some sort of open source license and a complete absence
</I>&gt;<i> of patent protection for it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not really care. But you might develop something and your users end up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paying money to the owner that is not you.  Or a wonder idea and they patent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it and prohibit actual use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Patent I think is a separate issue, the proper way to solve that one
</I>&gt;<i> being to eliminate software patents (this is in my proposal queue
</I>&gt;<i> already ;-)  But with few exceptions IP in open source licensing is a
</I>&gt;<i> copyright issue, not a patent issue.
