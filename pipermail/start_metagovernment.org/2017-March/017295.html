</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I imagine a job like that, my first idea when I look at the planet is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, try to lower fertility and increase education with some mild means
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hopefully people will make peace, improve liberty, equality and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relationships.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whether or not these things are related I think is pretty much
</I>&gt;<i> speculation at this point:
</I>

Sure it is speculation. The example is simple mind-body distinction.
Fertility-body, education-mind.


&gt;<i> Certainly the countries with the lowest
</I>&gt;<i> birth rates *aren't* doing the best overall. Japan, for example, is a
</I>&gt;<i> financial disaster exactly because they haven't balanced costs
</I>&gt;<i> associated with caring for (or at least appeasing) seniors with the
</I>&gt;<i> needs of younger people. IMHO the primary need to reduce the
</I>&gt;<i> population stems almost exclusively from the need to protect the
</I>&gt;<i> environment (which wasn't on your list).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You are right, my point was environmental. Ecosystem (at certain
technological level) may carry just a limited population.
National accouts and solidarity of generations are less important than
ecological laws.
But here we are very close to discussion that is unbearable to most of
population and I do not think that they will be able to have reasonable
discussion about health cost, life and death any time soon. I believe that
they will preffer an authorian or psychopath to decide instead of them.
What do you think? Are they able to decide when to leave people to die?

Cheers
