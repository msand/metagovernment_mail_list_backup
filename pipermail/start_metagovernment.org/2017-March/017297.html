Nice diffs, thanks!

&gt;<i> The governance model must also be such that it can be implemented within the

This still seems to me a Catch 22: I can't think of any way to achieve
any of the kinds of changes they're looking for *except* by putting
restrictions on nations that e.g., dictators will simply refuse to
comply with. I don't know what they're expecting, but they've made a
fundamental mistake here if they think they're going to get anything
but variations on the &quot;UN&quot; theme if they try to enforce that rule.
Which of course is going to get them exactly nothing, as has been
demonstrated by the UN every time it has been tasked with resolving
some conflict.

But I do sympathize with their position: You can't really announce a
competition where all the entries that have any chance of succeeding
start out with &quot;The first thing we do, let's kill all the dictators&quot;.
Matchism included, although I'd propose that it's not necessarily the
*first* thing we need to do. But eventually when people catch on I
figure we'll toss off a drone strike against a Kim or Assad with nor
more thought than we give to bombing a wedding party in Yemen now.

     Scott
