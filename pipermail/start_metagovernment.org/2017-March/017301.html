<PRE>Yes, it&#8217;s pretty tall order they&#8217;ve put forward. It seems they're hedging the &quot;implementation requirements&quot; a wee bit with the (c) clause below.

I imagine with a $5 mil prize there will be a substantial number of submissions from some pretty bright people. I&#8217;m hoping they'll publish links to the other entries once the competition is over&#8230;.or at least to the top 2 dozen or so. I&#8217;m really curious to see what comes out of this.

Also, it seems like they're preserving the option of combining ideas from several entries into a single plan or model. Could be interesting&#8230;.

(c) Competition Entries will be assessed on the basis of how well they can be expected to fulfil the criteria listed in section 2.2 above. In some cases, ensuring that certain goals are met may make it harder to realize other goals. In such cases, trade-offs must be made. How well participants manage such trade-offs will be an important factor in the assessment.
