<PRE>Hi!

Let us assume...(still talking about &quot;prediction of goodness&quot;)

1. Good result is honest positive democratic feedback. (morality in
descriptive sense)
2. Good system creates good results.
3. Good processes makes good system.
4. Discussion-decision-implementation-effects is elementary process of a
system.

but the 1. is problematic.
It may work fine at municipal level.
It will fail at some moments imho, foreign policy might be a good example.
So I started searching for other definitions of &quot;good result&quot;.
I have not found for foreign policy, but for birth rate. Let us accept 1
but we should also add an condition imho and say that starvation must be
zero to accept the feedback. If it is not zero, I would say that the
processes ( those like in 4)  influencing birth rate we not good. I mean
bad result, no matter what democracy says.

You may see it as a small flaw, but I think it is something bigger. For
most common human flaws we do need to compensate and we will need to find
other definitions of &quot;good results&quot;.
This means different different equations for different areas.
The compensation must happen at the field of science. Such compensations
may be impossible in running political system.

Please do not confuse me with Scott. As I understand it Scott is designing
one system that compensates all flaws. I design mechanisms for evaluation
of systems. And I try to pair problematiques with systems.

Cheers
m.
