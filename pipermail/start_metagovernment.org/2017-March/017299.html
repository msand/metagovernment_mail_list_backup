<PRE>Just make human much much much more intelligent and more willing to use
their brain!  Or remove them from the picture.
The second is a little radical but the first is really what we need. I
encounter too much superficiality around me and is not about education, is
about mind laziness, I know educated people that do not want to think.
In Italy we use to say, NEEDS SHARPEN THE BRAIN and is another factor that
actual God place in our survival instinct.
Unfortunately our live is too short to remember past mistakes in history,
even the one that happen during our passage on earth so we are always on
the emergency stage of problem solving.
Anyway there is a simple rule that will solve all issues... Love your
neighbor as yourself
