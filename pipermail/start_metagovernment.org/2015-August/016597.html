<PRE>Free Market Democracy?
just yesterday I was confronted with a dilemma, serious and painful.
Tecnologie Democratiche, the association that oversee the development and
hosting of the Airesis platform will be forced to close down for lack of
funds if we do not find rapidly any sustainable solutions. Our software
work fine and deliver but the Public Administration is not taking into
consideration its use not even at the local level. The internal conflict of
interest with the administration is greater than the benefits. We get big
smiles
Does any of you have any Idea on how to subsidize an Edemocracy project?
Donation are coming in but are not sufficient and the lack of interest from
the general public, apart the volunteer that are giving great amount of
time and effort to keep it going.
&gt;<i>From my perspective the only way is to form an Edemocracy movement purely
</I>based on edemocracy. But all of you know that even there we need a lot of
money...
So, if some one can answer on Alexander question but also add some idea on
how to bring to the market Edemocracy without killing the purpose, I will
be very happy to get inspiration.
Maybe we should change the thread! A good Meme for Democracy will help!
Regards
Jacopo
