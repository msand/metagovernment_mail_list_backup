BS: You seem to think banks are some sort of magical organizations.
They're not, they're merely complicated. The problem isn't the
complexity, it's that the people running (and regulating) them *use*
this complexity to obscure what they're doing. Turn control over to
The People (who are by definition uncorruptable) and it will vastly
simplify the regulatory process because the people doing it aren't
working *against* the will of The People like they do now.

&gt;<i> I can go into detail and explain you what is wrong, but i don't even know
</I>&gt;<i> where to start.
</I>
Please do. But please also explain how you plan to regulate inflation
and currency exchange rates without central organizations like that.
Central banks are *necessary* to do those things in any non-trivial
economic system.

&gt;<i> =&gt; gaming the system by exploiting the personality characteristics of SDAPs
</I>&gt;<i> who are running central banks? ...it cannot be fixed. stop wishful thinking
</I>
Why not? Are you saying that The People are not capable of running
their government and economic systems and that they must rely on SDAPs
to do it for them?

&gt;<i> The SDAP problem will be fixed by building decentralised  alternatives where
</I>&gt;<i> rules are so different, that SDAPs cannot succeed any longer with their
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;methods&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Austerity is inherent to capitalism in its final stage - simplified its like
</I>&gt;<i> a game of monopoly, where the winner is &quot;generous&quot; to the losers just to
</I>&gt;<i> keep the game alive.
</I>
Again, not under Matchism: The People will decide exactly what the
acceptable margin of winning and losing is, then create the rules to
maintain those boundaries.

&gt;<i> fixing &quot;authoritarion behavior imposed by central banks &amp; monopolistic
</I>&gt;<i> behavior can be solved by rethinking money in a decentralised way. it's
</I>&gt;<i> already being done with blockchain technology and it actually doesnt matter
</I>&gt;<i> if you see it or not.
</I>
Talk about &quot;not possible&quot;: You're going to reprogram all of our brains
with your new concept of money?

&gt;<i> Removing SDAPs is impossible
</I>
Removing them from power is certainly not impossible, and in fact is
the natural result of a true direct democracy (one where *everyone*
votes, either directly or via a personality-matched proxy).

&gt;<i> Chaning everyones perception of money is easy.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Early birds experiment with blockchain technology and start to use it
</I>&gt;<i> amongst themselves
</I>
So the ability to track everyone's purchases is some sort of answer?
To what problem, exactly?

&gt;<i> 2. Once it gains traction (it currently is gaining traction) those who

</I>&gt;<i> 3. The old money will only be used by those who don't understand, but they
</I>&gt;<i> will feel how their money is not working any longer and without
</I>&gt;<i> understanding the details, they see how everything works better with this
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;new money&quot; and they will slowly switch, because it will increase their
</I>&gt;<i> wealth :-)
</I>
So, what, someone who understands blockchains will be able to track
where the bribes come and go from? That'd be nothing more than a
band-aid on the SDAP problem (and it can easily be thwarted by
creating opaque intermediaries). And, again, how do you propose to
regulate things like inflation and exchange rates without fiat
currency? Block chain looks to me like nothing more than a high-tech
version of the gold standard, and that's the economic equivalent of
Anthropogenic Climate Change denial (i.e., 97% of economists will tell
you it's just unworkable).
