<PRE>representative democracy or the U.S.A. is a fine government that needs
a control put on it to end the corruption or at least to shorten it.
FREE MARKET DEMOCRACY is a expression vote by representatives that is
not a government funded or controled group. FREE means FREE, of
corruption, of sovereigns, paid employees. The concept only lacks a
condition of FREE from some web limiter or designer or master. The web
can make such a thing possible. The expression of FREE people can only
happen in a FREE zone.
promote FREE MARKET DEMOCRACY trust yourself to govern yourself &quot;YOU&quot;
are SOCIETY

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally got around to this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2 months! That must be some kind of record! By comparison, this reply
</I>&gt;<i> is only a month late ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fair enough. I think editing posts are asking for trouble and confusion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though. Edits gives power to the proposer to try and manipulate the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion by restarting it each time they preform an edit. It's easier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the casual user to follow along if it's not changing ever week. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will flow smoothly because no one can just change what they said which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make the rest of the thread not make sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My conception is that proposals are not a &quot;conversation&quot;, they're more
</I>&gt;<i> like software upgrades (i.e., they will be few and far between). If
</I>&gt;<i> someone is doing a daily &quot;upgrade&quot; to the proposal or has to do more
</I>&gt;<i> than a handful of releases to get a usable product out, people will
</I>&gt;<i> quickly lose interest and the proposal will just wither and die.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But juries aren't an attainable position, they are assigned randomly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LOL! You've obviously never sat through a jury selection process. Last
</I>&gt;<i> time I was called (a few months ago, for a drug possession trial),
</I>&gt;<i> there were 80 people called to fill 12 spots and lots of maneuvering
</I>&gt;<i> to get out of serving. Having a PhD I had a huge advantage over them,
</I>&gt;<i> and a 15-second spiel about my belief that our &quot;war on drugs&quot; is a
</I>&gt;<i> clear demonstration of how social conservatives have coopted our legal
</I>&gt;<i> system for their own purposes ensured I would be excused (i.e. I
</I>&gt;<i> simply stated that their goal is to facilitate punishment rather than
</I>&gt;<i> to protect us all from criminal behavior,  a viewnI find alien and
</I>&gt;<i> barbaric but which is held by most Authoritarians). The people left
</I>&gt;<i> (who returned a unanimous guilty verdict, BTW) were the people who
</I>&gt;<i> *wanted* to serve. IMHO the people who serve on juries, just like the
</I>&gt;<i> people who desire to serve in representative government, are exactly
</I>&gt;<i> the wrong people to take on those roles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Say
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the site picks 10 random users and asked them to uphold the rules of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> site e.g. no hate speech. Get the 10 to decide if the post made qualifies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hate speech. If found guilty - time penatly from posting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, wrong people making the decision, wrong remedy when a
</I>&gt;<i> problematic post occurs. Why go to all the trouble to censor someone
</I>&gt;<i> when you can instead just give people the tools to filter them, which
</I>&gt;<i> avoids all the freedom of speech issues?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that I'm not opposed to this sort of &quot;sampling&quot; to try to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> bias in general, I'm just inclined to think that it's a weak method
</I>&gt;<i> because unless you find some way to *ensure* that everyone who's
</I>&gt;<i> called actually casts a vote, the &quot;randomness&quot; you seek is an
</I>&gt;<i> illusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have rules of the site, if you can't follow them you can't post, seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a equally valid method of dealing with trolls. This assumes we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guarantee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only one account per person though. Otherwise it's a lost cause either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Remember, this is not a &quot;site&quot; we're talking about, it's the
</I>&gt;<i> government. *Any* proposal that requires excluding people is a
</I>&gt;<i> non-starter IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But my argument is that it's better being an actual public job that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can see happen online. Getting multiple people to submit redrafts will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ensure the best summarization of proposals and encourage a standard of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> quality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've no problem with professionals (indeed paid professionals) doing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> most of the work. That's what the Managers are in the Matchism
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposal, and where I expect most of the proposals will come from. I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just have a problem with paying *everyone* to do this kind of work
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> because unless you have a very sophisticated bidding and management
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system (something like what Ned has proposed with Blinap) it just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seems to me to open up too many avenues for gaming the system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not everyone is getting paid, only the one's who are skilled re-drafters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The managers in your system are getting chosen and paid by the public as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well no? Same concept, experts in the field.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who picks the re-drafters?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The capitalist system's is driven by the profit motive in money that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theoretically would destroy everything around it to achieve that profit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system's driven by the motive of well being to the greatest number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people. I don't think that will need regulating the same way. Money is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a reward for some hard work not the end goal of every proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My problem with introducing payments for the people participating has
</I>&gt;<i> nothing do with the normal downsides of capitalism (exploitation of
</I>&gt;<i> resources, workers, etc.), it has to do with corruption: As soon as
</I>&gt;<i> you introduce a system where people expect to get paid for doing
</I>&gt;<i> things, they'll either stop doing them *unless* they get paid (turning
</I>&gt;<i> play into work) or find a way to game the system such that they end up
</I>&gt;<i> getting paid more than everyone else. What that results in is SDAPs
</I>&gt;<i> (who are the most susceptible to this type of influence) being in
</I>&gt;<i> charge. Which is exactly the problem with the systems we have now.
