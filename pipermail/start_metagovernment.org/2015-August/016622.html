<PRE>&gt;<i> 2 months! That must be some kind of record! By comparison, this reply

</I>


Ha yeah...made up for it this time though, reply in under 2 weeks!



&gt;<i> My conception is that proposals are not a &quot;conversation&quot;, they're more
</I>&gt;<i> like software upgrades (i.e., they will be few and far between). If
</I>&gt;<i> someone is doing a daily &quot;upgrade&quot; to the proposal or has to do more
</I>&gt;<i> than a handful of releases to get a usable product out, people will
</I>&gt;<i> quickly lose interest and the proposal will just wither and die.
</I>
How do you propose that a conversation occurs then? We need that initial
proposal/idea put out there to get the dialogue started and concentrated on
a specific area. Even if it's a poorly thought out proposal it's a starting
point that we can build off of and reference in the future should it fail
to be completed. Proposals should wither and die if they become complicated
or bogged down with post adoptions, it will still be available as
a precedent for the next proposal that tries to solve something similar.
It's the same concept as editing the proposal to make it better except this
method retains the discussion that already occurred on the old edition so
we can easily reference the key points later.



My problem with editing and filtering of posts as you suggest is it
disrupts the natural flow of discussion. Say if someone makes a point on a
proposal and then another person comes along and makes a comment on the
point that totally disproves the point, this is a important bit of
information for everyone to acknowledge. But the original poster of the
point can then come back, see that their post has been refuted and is now
doing harm against the side of the proposal they're arguing for, so then
they simply change the content of their point so the comment attached no
longer makes sense and it ends up being wasted text, and the bit of
information is lost.



As a general convention I think we should attempt to design a system that
lowers overall posting but still enables everyone an opportunity to
participate. Instead of filtering posts though I still think this can
be achieved by making the act of posting a bit of a challenging thing.
Have guidelines that ensure conversations stay on topic and are properly
structured, give each post a guideline to fill out, creating a familiar
format for each post to ensure easy reading and responding. My site
currently has a version of that in place, each new proposal must answer
some general questions of who, what, why, where, when, how before posting.
This helps shape proposals into sub-sections that can then be discussed
individually, so when a poster wants to post a proposal that's not fully
fleshed out yet, they are forced to consider those areas at least and it
creates a familiar structure that can then be worked on more easily.

&gt;<i> Note that I'm not opposed to this sort of &quot;sampling&quot; to try to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> bias in general, I'm just inclined to think that it's a weak method
</I>&gt;<i> because unless you find some way to *ensure* that everyone who's
</I>&gt;<i> called actually casts a vote, the &quot;randomness&quot; you seek is an
</I>&gt;<i> illusion.
</I>


Point about people finding there way on to juries is understood. If there
was also a penalty imposed on people for not participating in a jury when
they were called upon, that would help ensure the randomness. Users could
only be chosen if they were active on the forum to increase the likelihood
they would participate.

&gt;&gt;<i> Have rules of the site, if you can't follow them you can't post, seems
</I>like
&gt;&gt;<i> a equally valid method of dealing with trolls. This assumes we can
</I>guarantee
&gt;&gt;<i> only one account per person though. Otherwise it's a lost cause either
</I>way.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Remember, this is not a &quot;site&quot; we're talking about, it's the
</I>&gt;<i> government. *Any* proposal that requires excluding people is a
</I>&gt;<i> non-starter IMHO.
</I>
Posting is different than voting, no one should be excluded from voting for
proposals or comments ever, your voice will never be completed silenced,
the only thing that gets limited is their ability to make a mess of the
forum with posting.


&gt;&gt;<i> Not everyone is getting paid, only the one's who are skilled re-drafters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The managers in your system are getting chosen and paid by the public as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well no? Same concept, experts in the field.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who picks the re-drafters?
</I>


Currently how I envision it working best is anyone can take a shot at being
a re-drafter for any proposal. Then each user that has had an adopted post
in the proposal's discussion period would be able to cast a vote of
approval if they feel that their point was adequately included in the
re-draft. The user who's re-draft has the most approvals makes a bit
of side cash.

&gt;<i> As soon as you introduce a system where people expect to get paid for
</I>doing
&gt;<i> things, they'll either stop doing them *unless* they get paid (turning
</I>&gt;<i> play into work) or find a way to game the system such that they end up
</I>&gt;<i> getting paid more than everyone else. What that results in is SDAPs
</I>&gt;<i> (who are the most susceptible to this type of influence) being in
</I>&gt;<i> charge. Which is exactly the problem with the systems we have now.
</I>
I agree with this for the most part, but this is a simple prize for a
competition. The pay would not be so significant to be worth gaming. It's a
small reward that's there to encourage re-drafts for all proposals when the
time comes, not only the exciting ones, it's the same amount for every
proposal regardless.
