No, they are not.

</I>

I am aware of this.



&gt;<i> Turn control over to
</I>&gt;<i> The People (who are by definition uncorruptable)
</I>

So, if you &quot;turn over control to &quot;THE PEOPLE&quot; (which probably means
everyone directly, right?),
means actually changing the &quot;System of Central Banking&quot; quite essentially.


&gt;<i> and it will vastly
</I>&gt;<i> simplify the regulatory process because the people doing it aren't
</I>&gt;<i> working *against* the will of The People like they do now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What are you talking about?



&gt;<i> &gt; I can go into detail and explain you what is wrong, but i don't even know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where to start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please do. But please also explain how you plan to regulate inflation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&quot;THE PEOPLE&quot; will vote on an interest rate which can be negative, zero or
positive.
Maybe something simple like &quot;THE MEDIAN&quot; of what &quot;THE PEOPLE&quot; vote on, will
do just fine.
If this rule will become law, the media will make it a &quot;hot topic&quot; and
people will discuss it.
It's a single number and discussion about what it means to vote for a
certain number might
give material for endless discussions, but anyway...
... what's especially important is, that the &quot;INCOME&quot;, generated by the
&quot;inflation tax&quot; (which for transparency reasons,
I would express as a calculated loss of buying power, so it's easier for
everyone to grasp than doing the math themselves),
will be equally distributed to all &quot;THE PEOPLE&quot;, which will cause a &quot;BASIC
UNCONDITIONAL INCOME&quot;


&gt;<i> and currency exchange rates without central organizations like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Currency Exchange Rates should be subject to FX markets and every tourist
can to a minor degree participate.
I don't see the reason to put forth regulations.
Yes i know, this will take basically all the power from institutions and
give it to the people instead, which are &quot;THE SOUVEREIGN&quot;

Central banks are *necessary* to do those things in any non-trivial
&gt;<i> economic system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's not true. And if not put forth by the current establishment,
blockchain technology will prove in the near future.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; =&gt; gaming the system by exploiting the personality characteristics of
</I>&gt;<i> SDAPs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who are running central banks? ...it cannot be fixed. stop wishful
</I>&gt;<i> thinking
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not? Are you saying that The People are not capable of running
</I>&gt;<i> their government and economic systems and that they must rely on SDAPs
</I>&gt;<i> to do it for them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

No. You seem to suggest, that &quot;THE PEOPLE&quot; will or should be in control,
but you defend &quot;central banking&quot; and &quot;banks&quot; as they exist today.
That's paradox. You should decide what you actually want to say.


&gt;<i>  [....]
</I>
&gt;<i> fixing &quot;authoritarion behavior imposed by central banks &amp; monopolistic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavior can be solved by rethinking money in a decentralised way. it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already being done with blockchain technology and it actually doesnt
</I>&gt;<i> matter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you see it or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Talk about &quot;not possible&quot;: You're going to reprogram all of our brains
</I>&gt;<i> with your new concept of money?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

No. The market will do it. Everyone will decide for themselves.
Talking doesn't convince nobody. That's my experience.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Removing SDAPs is impossible
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Removing them from power is certainly not impossible, and in fact is
</I>&gt;<i> the natural result of a true direct democracy (one where *everyone*
</I>&gt;<i> votes, either directly or via a personality-matched proxy).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
People already vote with money every day.
It's not perfect, but in this system, everyone is asked every day to vote
on whatever suits him by BUYING something.
This is real power and makes the economy and the world spin.
The rest is just &quot;Fairytale Stories&quot; that will be a thing of the past in
the future, but for now, people are still early in their &quot;wake up process&quot;.
But those who woke up already building alternatives.
1. Look at the &quot;Open Source Movement&quot;
2. Look at existing Blockchain Systems and similar approaches to get out of
the old broken ways.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Chaning everyones perception of money is easy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Early birds experiment with blockchain technology and start to use it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; amongst themselves
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the ability to track everyone's purchases is some sort of answer?
</I>&gt;<i> To what problem, exactly?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No. Blockchains are not more and not less than decentralised databases.
Everyone can see whats going on, and doesn't need to trust the word of a
bank.
Whether an account is &quot;associatable&quot; with a person or not depends on the
process of proofing whether an actual real person controls an account or
not.
I guess this will be some kind of &quot;OPT IN&quot; mechanism that will &quot;win the
hearts&quot; of everyone, because it will make sense to them.

Otherwise, I don't understand what you are referring to.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Once it gains traction (it currently is gaining traction) those who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand join
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. The old money will only be used by those who don't understand, but
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will feel how their money is not working any longer and without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understanding the details, they see how everything works better with this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;new money&quot; and they will slowly switch, because it will increase their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wealth :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, what, someone who understands blockchains will be able to track
</I>&gt;<i> where the bribes come and go from?
</I>

The UK started to teach every kid in the entire nation how to program and
other countries will sooner or later follow.
There are tons of reports that you can google that estimate 50-80% of
todays jobs will be automated or taken over
by machines in the next 5-10 years, depending on whom you follow.
Every job will involve some sort of knowledge about programming. It's the
literacy of the future and it doesn't care if someone believes it or not.



&gt;<i> That'd be nothing more than a
</I>&gt;<i> band-aid on the SDAP problem (and it can easily be thwarted by
</I>&gt;<i> creating opaque intermediaries).
</I>

Who cares - it doesn't need to be perfect, it only needs to be better than
what we have right now and it sure will be, because its technically
possible.



&gt;<i> And, again, how do you propose to
</I>&gt;<i> regulate things like inflation and exchange rates without fiat
</I>&gt;<i> currency?
</I>

Blockchain is a decentralised database on which you can build all kinds of
currencies with all kinds of rules and you can change and adapt them if
majority of people having wallets agree to do so. Literacy will spread
steadily, because more people giving it a try and make it work - that will
create positive news to those who did not use it yet. A force that PULLS
people towards trying it.
In the same time, the corrupted ways we currently have will make people
using the old institutions unsatisfied and eventually looking for
alternatives. They complain already - so this is some kind of &quot;negative
force&quot; that PUSHES people towards blockchain alternatives - first to become
curious, then to try and eventually to switch over.



&gt;<i> Block chain looks to me like nothing more than a high-tech
</I>&gt;<i> version of the gold standard, and that's the economic equivalent of
</I>&gt;<i> Anthropogenic Climate Change denial (i.e., 97% of economists will tell
</I>&gt;<i> you it's just unworkable).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So you don't understand it.
1. Blockchain technology does not mean BITCOIN.
2. check for example &quot;ethereum.org&quot; they offer decentralised contracts and
have a &quot;crypto coin&quot; with built in inflation - there will never be a max
number of coins.
3. you can build whatever currency you want and people already started to
play with it - there are zillions of so called &quot;altcoins&quot; (alternative
coins - which are not bitcoin)
