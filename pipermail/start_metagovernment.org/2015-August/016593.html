<PRE>A expression vote is not the the government asking for a vote. A
expression is not a vote, it is outside of government control or for
that matter anyones control, only the expressor is involved. The web
can make this possible but they probably need money or they will lay
down and not do a thing. My concept is a cheap in mailbox yes or no
expression device that is mailman activated just like the mail that I
get out of the box.
promote FREE MARKET DEMOCRACY trust yourself to govern yourself &quot;YOU&quot;
are SOCIETY

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you're interested in this, I recommend Owen
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Flanagan's &quot;The Really Hard Problem: Meaning in a Material World&quot; as a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> good overview, where he talks a lot about &quot;eudamonia&quot;: What is &quot;a good
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> life&quot;? He, and other philosophers, seem to generally agrees with me
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that you can't answer that by just asking people if they are satisfied
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or happy or whatever. Living a good life requires more than that, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> indeed directly conflicts with it in many cases.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here we should distinguish between decision making process and outcome.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In decision making process I proposed to maximize pleasure in initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the other hand when it comes to out later outcomes I am for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happiness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I'm thinking this is an extremely limiting perspective for
</I>&gt;<i> formulating public policy. And probably for decisionmaking in general.
</I>&gt;<i> Fear of making a bad choice is vastly more powerful (hence the
</I>&gt;<i> existence of conservatives), and I'd even be willing to bet you could
</I>&gt;<i> motivate more people by providing them with a sense of purpose than by
</I>&gt;<i> promising (or even delivering) that they'll &quot;enjoy&quot; the process of
</I>&gt;<i> governing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not that I disagree with the conclusions of the paper: It seems to me
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fairly obvious that people prefer to have more control over the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems that they must function in, and using the political power of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> natives vs. foreigners in Switzerland seems to me about the best place
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to look at this issue. I expect the effect size to be far larger once
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we develop a general proxy-based direct democracy decisionmaking
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is possible that proxies are good solution. It is based on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assumption that deciding is boring or too dificult for most of people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe simply too timeconsuming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As you know I am trying to challenge this assumption with my project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://participedia.net/en/methods/parties-global-agora">http://participedia.net/en/methods/parties-global-agora</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have made some advance, I will try to update the page soon.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Later I will probably allow for some proxies in my project too, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first of all I would like to try to boost participation and spread of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Higher participation rates has got to be a design goal in *any* system
</I>&gt;<i> that effectively deals with SDAPs: Their participation rates are just
</I>&gt;<i> naturally higher and you need to either suppress that or bring in more
</I>&gt;<i> Neurotypicals to compensate. But a matched-proxy based system is the
</I>&gt;<i> only thing I've been able to come up with that will achieve the vast
</I>&gt;<i> increase in effective participation rates we need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not think so. I do not talk here just about &quot;final solution&quot;. I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talking about implementation strategy here as well. At the moment when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my movement has a few people, budget is important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I actually don't worry about this issue much: The cost of running a
</I>&gt;<i> system capable of supporting even thousands of users is negligible
</I>&gt;<i> (other than the software development itself, of course), and when
</I>&gt;<i> you're able to run significantly above that number you'll have no
</I>&gt;<i> trouble collecting the user contributions (or grants, or whatever)
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to scale it up.
