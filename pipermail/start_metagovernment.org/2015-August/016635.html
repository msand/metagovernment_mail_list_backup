And yet, the words &quot;decision&quot; and&quot;public policy&quot; don't appear anywhere
in the article! Nor in any of your other references. How does
blockchain, or any other economic tool, help us decide whether to
approve the Iran deal or formulate a reasonable immigration policy or
decide what kind of criminal justice system we should have or any
other of the thousands of decisions a government must make?

This whole thread is now OT WRT to government and I recommend we
collectively decide to discourage any further discussions of economic
systems here because they really don't have anything to do with
replacing our current broken forms of government (that is, they have
nothing to do with decisionmaking). Promotion of them IMHO is only
makes clear that one doesn't really understand the distinction between
economic and public policy decisionmaking systems and is a distraction
to those of us who do (i.e., it's like arguing in favor of democracy
over communism, which is a dead giveaway you're a noob). It's hard for
me to tell whether Alexander is just blinded by his zealotry or
whether he is just as inherently naive as those who follow any other
rigid ideology. I do know that he has not provided reasonable answers
to any of my questions about how money can be used to make public
policy decisions.

Back to the original topic, I've been fascinated by Trump's
anti-immigration rants and as a bit of synchronicity just watched
Giant (a 1950s film starring Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson) which I
didn't know was in large part about the conflict in Texas culture
about how to treat &quot;wetbacks&quot; (the only term they use for Hispanics in
the movie, even though many of their descendants lived in Texas long
before white people had even &quot;discovered&quot; America). The &quot;leaders&quot; in
that movie (billionaire oil and cattle men) are stereotypical SDAP, as
of course is Trump, and it just makes me wonder how people still fail
to see that it doesn't matter what your economic system is
(capitalist, socialist, or communist), the problem is a decisionmaking
system that puts people like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Putin, Bush,
Netanyahu, and yes, Trump, in charge. Back to the original subject,
memetics, what does it take to get people to realize that it's SDAPs
that are the problem and to insist on a form of government that
specifically deals with that? How to we take the great skill people
have at identifying &quot;wetback&quot; or &quot;Jew&quot; or whatever and train it to
recognize SDAP instead?

    Scott
