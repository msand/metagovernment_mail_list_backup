I'm sure I'm misunderstanding your point, but how do you propose that
any organization runs without management? The problem isn't the
concept of management, it's who has the ultimate responsibility for
defining the goals that management is tasked with achieving. In our
current systems, the executive branch *also* has the ability to define
these goals. Worse, the legislative branch, which should bear sole
responsibility for defining the goals, is composed largely of SDAPs
(Social Dominators, Authoritarians, and Psychopaths) whose idea of the
purpose of government is very different from the average
Neurotypical's.

    Scott
