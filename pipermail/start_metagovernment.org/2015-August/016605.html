<PRE>Thank you Scott!! very glad to see that I am in tune with your vision but
is not easy to work unpaid and sustain  a family and a a revolutionary idea
in our society, at least I can speak for the Italian Situation.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Free Market Democracy?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just yesterday I was confronted with a dilemma, serious and painful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tecnologie Democratiche, the association that oversee the development and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hosting of the Airesis platform will be forced to close down for lack of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; funds if we do not find rapidly any sustainable solutions. Our software
</I>&gt;<i> work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fine and deliver but the Public Administration is not taking into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consideration its use not even at the local level. The internal conflict
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interest with the administration is greater than the benefits. We get big
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; smiles
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very sorry to hear this, but then, I can't say I'm surprised:
</I>&gt;<i> eDemocracy, at least to the extent that it facilitates Direct
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy, represents an existential threat to the powers-that-be. Any
</I>&gt;<i> project that becomes even the least bit successful will immediately be
</I>&gt;<i> shunned by them, and if it is possible, they will work to cut of
</I>&gt;<i> funding or any other form of support. Counting on government funding
</I>&gt;<i> from the start will only hasten the project's demise IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
we are now on the 5th year from the beginning of the project and we have
not get a penny from the government, at the European level we fail on two
proposal and we see that the way is managed does fall almost in power abuse
over the discretionality and absolute immunity  of their decisions.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does any of you have any Idea on how to subsidize an Edemocracy project?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually it must be subsidized by The People. My plan is to
</I>&gt;<i> institute a voluntary &quot;tax&quot; of some small yet significant amount (say,
</I>&gt;<i> 1% of income) that people will have a moral obligation to pay if they
</I>&gt;<i> participate in the system. That of course only handles the transition
</I>&gt;<i> from start-up phase to actual implementation as THE government, i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> after it has sufficient momentum that a significant number of people
</I>&gt;<i> start to believe that it will actually (eventually) become the
</I>&gt;<i> government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
we need far less to function properly and we ask for a membership fee in
the association Tecnologie Democratiche (TD) that include a certification
of the user, done by presenting a document and by contact via
teleconferencing each new member.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for how to get to that point, one obvious answer would seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> crowdfunding. I'm a little skeptical that this will really work for
</I>&gt;<i> early-stage funding, however. You'd either have to have a really good
</I>&gt;<i> sales pitch or a big name behind you to convince people that it's
</I>&gt;<i> really viable. But even that is no guarantee of success: I look at the
</I>&gt;<i> stalled momentum of Kahn Academy (<A HREF="https://www.khanacademy.org/">https://www.khanacademy.org/</A>) as a
</I>&gt;<i> prime example of this. In a sense it is very similar kind of project,
</I>&gt;<i> taking power from existing institutions and distributing it to The
</I>&gt;<i> People. And it has everything going for it, plenty of users, plenty of
</I>&gt;<i> funding, and many big names (including things like Bill Gates
</I>&gt;<i> promoting it at TED conferences). But near as I can tell, adoption of
</I>&gt;<i> it has stalled (e.g., look at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=kahn%20academy">https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=kahn%20academy</A>). IMHO this is
</I>&gt;<i> primarily because of the exact same problem you're (and we're all)
</I>&gt;<i> facing, which is resistance from the establishment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This analysis does not take into consideration the amount of  similar web
site popping out, I have my children giving up Khanacademy because their
school purchase a similar platform where they are &quot;forced to go&quot; because
the professors of their school dictate them.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, my conclusion is that funding is not really the problem and that
</I>&gt;<i> you really do have to rely on volunteers to do the heavy lifting. If
</I>&gt;<i> the project really is viable (or can be made so by repeated
</I>&gt;<i> reinvention) the volunteers will stick around long enough to spread
</I>&gt;<i> the ideas out into the general population.
</I>

The experience is that volunteer come and go after a while for exhaustion
and sometime because they loose the faith or seeing the goal too far.



&gt;<i> If it's not, better it die
</I>&gt;<i> or scale back until the necessary breakthrough can be made/discovered.
</I>&gt;<i> In this model the only significant financial needs are server time,
</I>&gt;<i> which is pretty cheap (at least compared with paying for things like
</I>&gt;<i> rent and salaries).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The interface start to shine but the agile production method and constant
little upgrades are making the testing very demanding and still we have
bugs here and there to fix.
The major work is to programme it and add the function we deliberate.
Is not easy to find volunteer


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Donation are coming in but are not sufficient and the lack of interest
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the general public, apart the volunteer that are giving great amount of
</I>&gt;<i> time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and effort to keep it going.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From my perspective the only way is to form an Edemocracy movement purely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; based on edemocracy. But all of you know that even there we need a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; money...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you need the money for, exactly? Paying programmers,
</I>&gt;<i> administrators, office space, advertising? Most startups that go into
</I>&gt;<i> business with this mindset fail, and usually fairly quickly. Better to
</I>&gt;<i> search for the idea(s) that will keep volunteers interested than in
</I>&gt;<i> working to design and support all that overhead. That is the way all
</I>&gt;<i> revolutions in the past have come about. Maybe a meme for this is &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> Revolution Won't Be Crowdfunded&quot; ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Most of the funds goes into programming and we are recently screen few ruby
programmer to work at the platform, there is one president of the
association that have given so much and not only he does not get paid but
he invest some time hoping to get back his &quot;loan&quot;, no office rent,
advertising is done by the many that they use the platform and
communication is done as we goes along and forward. But is direct word of
mouth.
A social media that is not much fun to surf!!!
For the moment I like to see popping out different languages version
www.airesis.info

Slowly but surely... hopefully!!
Thank for the meme, I will try it to communicate it
Regards
J
