Private banks don't *issue* the money though. That's the job of the
central back. And without it, you have no fiat currency, and without
that you have no control over the economy.

&gt;<i> * Changing who decides when and how much and TO WHOM issue currency changes
</I>&gt;<i> EVERYTHING!
</I>
Well, I hope so, because that's what we're all counting on here ;-)

&gt;<i> It decides who gets how much power to spend money on whatever.
</I>
Right, all I'm arguing, contrary to your initial proposal, is that
central banks are a necessary component of the machine that is the
economy. Without them, there is no way to regulate things like
inflation, exchange rates, etc. and the economy will experience wild
boom and bust cycles. Those hurt everyone, but especially the poorest
people. But maybe that does't concern you, as I sense libertarianism
(in the US sense) in your argument that what we should do is allow
money control everything.

&gt;<i> Great - sounds like someone with at least some clues - but I still think in
</I>&gt;<i> the not so long run - blockchain based systems will replace the brokenness
</I>&gt;<i> of what we have now.
</I>
It's still unclear to me as to how it will help at all. What is it
about banks that you fear, the fact that they hold the money for us,
or the fact that you have no control over how they use (lend) it?
Cryptocurrencies solve the first problem, but do nothing for the
second. Mt. Gox being the great example of that, but the alternative,
everyone doing the digital equivalent of stuffing their money in their
mattresses, will stifle the economy because it will not be practical
to aggregate money to loan it out (which is what banks do).

&gt;<i> Blockchain has everything to do with breaking &quot;information asymmetrie&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> who controls &quot;THE TRUTH&quot; - which is currently banks.
</I>
What do I care that the bank knows how much money I have on deposit,
or have borrowed from them? That isn't even where the problem is, it's
in the policies they have that control who gets loans and how much
interest they pay and so on. Crytocurrencies do nothing to change
that. Direct democracy, on the other hand, deals specifically with
those issues.

&gt;&gt;<i> Right, and the Koch brothers buy politicians this way. And you're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> saying this is a good thing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who cares if politicians are bought - they play no relevant role in this
</I>&gt;<i> world.
</I>&gt;<i> The whole regular &quot;political systems&quot; we have these days are irrelevant.
</I>&gt;<i> The power is in the economy and how people spend money.
</I>
Again, just like central banks, politicians *do* play a crucial role
in the current systems, and cryptocurrencies would do nothing to
change that. I agree that getting rid of them *would* be a good thing,
but is only possible if a robust decision-making system can be built
to replace them.

&gt;&gt;<i> Economic and political systems are two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different things, and the farther you can keep them separated, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better it is for the weaker/poorer members of society
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think they are meant to be the same.
</I>&gt;<i> There are two political systems who compete and we should merge them into
</I>&gt;<i> the best of both worlds.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. monetary system &amp; economy (is what really moves reality on a daily basis
</I>&gt;<i> with everyone participating to some degree)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. fairytale democracy (which has some &quot;ideals&quot; that might inspire the rules
</I>&gt;<i> around the &quot;real democracy&quot; which is the former (1.))
</I>
This kind of philosophy is shared by most US libertarians. It's cruel,
naive, and in many cases requires an almost pathological denial of how
the real world works (e.g., it would consider the fact that SDAPs
currently control the power in the world to either be irrelevant or
possibly even a good thing).

&gt;&gt;<i> because the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government can't be used to control them the way money can.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, the government is used for that or does it all by itself.
</I>
How? If the people make the rules themselves, how can the &quot;government&quot;
be used to control them? The problem with representative democracy is
that the people making the rules are psychologically (and in most
cases philosophically) *different* from The People as a whole. Put The
People (or truly representative proxies) in charge and the decisions
and policies made will more closely reflect what is best for them.

&gt;<i> Sorry - I wish you good luck with your &quot;matchism&quot;, but I think we are too
</I>&gt;<i> far away in our perceptions of reality, that discussion makes any sense.
</I>&gt;<i> In addition I think I once was discussing systems proposed by people on this
</I>&gt;<i> or other mailinglists and the same goes for alternative monetary systems.
</I>
Most of the disagreements on this list seem to me to be about how to
*implement* direct democracy. I see very little disagreement, except
from you, that direct democracy *is* the appropriate goal. By focusing
on an economic solution to our problems, you seem to me to be
proposing to just ignore the issue of government and decisionmaking
entirely.

&gt;<i> great :-) That sounds awesome. congratulation.
</I>&gt;<i> So you were an employee for your whole life and the company you worked for
</I>&gt;<i> created that product.
</I>
I was an employee for a handful of companies, then a
contractor/consultant for a dozen more, then started my own company
(living the dream, or stereotype, depending on your perspective).

&gt;<i> The good thing about educating people about programming is, the future will
</I>&gt;<i> be brighter :-)
</I>
Sounds to me like proposing that everyone learn how to do surgery or
grow their own food. It's just not how civilization works, and
proposing that programming is somehow different from any other
specialization just sounds naive to me. Maybe I've got the same
delusion about teaching people psychology so that they can recognize
and control their Clinations, but at least it's not just a mundane and
niche skill like programming or moneylending...
