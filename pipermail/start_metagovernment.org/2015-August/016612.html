&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you Scott!! very glad to see that I am in tune with your vision
</I>but is
&gt;<i> &gt; not easy to work unpaid and sustain  a family and a a revolutionary
</I>idea in
&gt;<i> &gt; our society, at least I can speak for the Italian Situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can certainly understand that: We're not only expecting people to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute their time without payment, but can't even offer the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of a rich payout at the end like any business startup
</I>&gt;<i> can...
</I>
I am sure that there is the possibility to start a company that offer
Airesis as a service to a community for a fee. The association is counting
on donation to achieve the scope and we offer the online service free to
any group willing to use it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we are now on the 5th year from the beginning of the project and we
</I>have not
&gt;<i> &gt; get a penny from the government, at the European level we fail on two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal and we see that the way is managed does fall almost in power
</I>abuse
&gt;<i> &gt; over the discretionality and absolute immunity  of their decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm confused. I'm not sure where I got the idea that various
</I>&gt;<i> governments were funding Airesis, at least by contributing computing
</I>&gt;<i> resources and developer time. Has it been *all* volunteer since the
</I>&gt;<i> start? What changed that you need to do external fundraising now?
</I>
It was just a true statement and we are proud to being able to maintain
autonomy and to follow our internal fully democratic rules.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This analysis does not take into consideration the amount of  similar
</I>web
&gt;<i> &gt; site popping out, I have my children giving up Khanacademy because their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; school purchase a similar platform where they are &quot;forced to go&quot;
</I>because the
&gt;<i> &gt; professors of their school dictate them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a lot of these in the US too. They're not doing well:
</I>&gt;<i> Graduation rates are very low and there are many horror stories of
</I>&gt;<i> kids having to return to regular public schools and retake entire
</I>&gt;<i> grades to make up what they didn't learn in their on-line school. But
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO the problem is not the schools, it's the quality of the students
</I>&gt;<i> they're attracting (i.e., it's apparently not the best and brightest
</I>&gt;<i> switching, it's the kids who were struggling with public school to
</I>&gt;<i> begin with). But this shouldn't matter, at least if there weren't
</I>&gt;<i> SDAPs and others with vested interests in charge: There should be a
</I>&gt;<i> standard (core) curriculum and a student should be able to test out of
</I>&gt;<i> *anything*. Establishing that would quickly separate out the good from
</I>&gt;<i> the bad. And if the kids in a particular school don't make progress
</I>&gt;<i> (again, as measured by their test scores), their accreditation goes
</I>&gt;<i> away to make room for a competitor that will deliver.
</I>
The social function of school should not be underestimated,  I believe that
the standards must be set but we are all different and the system should
take into consideration this fact and be flexible to accomodate a good
amount of energy to try to bring as many bad to the good side.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We need to be able to ask the question of whether Kahn Academy is
</I>&gt;<i> better than your local public school. It's unanswerable now because
</I>&gt;<i> not only do we lack the metrics to do that assessment, but it'd be
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to even get the public school system to participate in this
</I>&gt;<i> sort of comparison because of their monopolistic and anti-competitive
</I>&gt;<i> mindset. Which is, again, something a true direct democracy could
</I>&gt;<i> solve, but IMHO won't ever be solved otherwise.
</I>
I do agree, in Italy there is ground for huge improvement and in september
ther will be a group of teachers testing Airesis to  try to design a school
reform by themself.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So, my conclusion is that funding is not really the problem and that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you really do have to rely on volunteers to do the heavy lifting. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the project really is viable (or can be made so by repeated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reinvention) the volunteers will stick around long enough to spread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the ideas out into the general population.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The experience is that volunteer come and go after a while for
</I>exhaustion
&gt;<i> &gt; and sometime because they loose the faith or seeing the goal too far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, this is always the case. But by &quot;volunteers&quot; I don't mean any
</I>&gt;<i> *particular* volunteer, just the set working on that project as a
</I>&gt;<i> whole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If it's not, better it die
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; or scale back until the necessary breakthrough can be made/discovered.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In this model the only significant financial needs are server time,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which is pretty cheap (at least compared with paying for things like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rent and salaries).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The interface start to shine but the agile production method and
</I>constant
&gt;<i> &gt; little upgrades are making the testing very demanding and still we have
</I>bugs
&gt;<i> &gt; here and there to fix.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The major work is to programme it and add the function we deliberate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is not easy to find volunteer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, my response to this is that it indicates that there is
</I>&gt;<i> something missing in the philosophy. Sure, there's always going to be
</I>&gt;<i> grunt work, but if you can't inspire *passion* in the volunteers, your
</I>&gt;<i> goals are either insufficiently bold, or perhaps in the wrong place
</I>&gt;<i> entirely. For example, a system that is founded on working with
</I>&gt;<i> existing government IMHO is one of the things that will drive *away*
</I>&gt;<i> volunteers, not encourage them. The goal at the start has to be to
</I>&gt;<i> *replace* the existing system, not supplement it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most of the funds goes into programming and we are recently screen few
</I>ruby
&gt;<i> &gt; programmer to work at the platform, there is one president of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; association that have given so much and not only he does not get paid
</I>but he
&gt;<i> &gt; invest some time hoping to get back his &quot;loan&quot;, no office rent,
</I>advertising
&gt;<i> &gt; is done by the many that they use the platform and communication is
</I>done as
&gt;<i> &gt; we goes along and forward. But is direct word of mouth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A social media that is not much fun to surf!!!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For the moment I like to see popping out different languages version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; www.airesis.info
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just for me, I'd rather see more quality than quantity. There are lots
</I>&gt;<i> of flaws even on the web site, and my recollection is that the
</I>&gt;<i> software was the same way (buttons that didn't work, a tutorial that
</I>&gt;<i> got stuck, etc.). Much better to find a niche and fill it well and
</I>&gt;<i> completely than try to solve every problem (and in every country) all
</I>&gt;<i> at once. And not to appear American (English) chauvinistic, but if you
</I>&gt;<i> believe that the problem is that there is insufficient critical mass
</I>&gt;<i> in any one country, better to put 100% of the wood behind the one
</I>&gt;<i> arrow that is the English language version because that by far is the
</I>&gt;<i> biggest potential market (indeed, as the most widely spoken second
</I>&gt;<i> language in the world, you could have more success with a solid
</I>&gt;<i> English version than if you supported every other language *combined*
</I>&gt;<i> if each of those others is even a little bit flaky or incomplete).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Slowly but surely... hopefully!!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank for the meme, I will try it to communicate it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regards
