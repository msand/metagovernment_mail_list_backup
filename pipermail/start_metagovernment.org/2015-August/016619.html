You are clueless :/ sry.
* Private Banks put the money into circulation, the central banks do not.
* Changing who decides when and how much and TO WHOM issue currency changes
EVERYTHING!
It decides who gets how much power to spend money on whatever.




&gt;<i> The problem with central banks is that the elites can use their access

Great - sounds like someone with at least some clues - but I still think in
the not so long run - blockchain based systems will replace the brokenness
of what we have now.


&gt;<i> They're clueless

</I>&gt;<i> any sort of minimum wage or &quot;basic income&quot;, neither of which work
</I>&gt;<i> properly because they don't take into account basic economics or human
</I>&gt;<i> nature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
have fun :-)
I wish you a lot of luck - maybe one day - already having problems on this
mailinglist - you will have at least as many followers as one of the
blockchain systems called bitcoin already has today.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Central banks are *necessary* to do those things in any non-trivial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; economic system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's not true. And if not put forth by the current establishment,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blockchain technology will prove in the near future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, the magic blockchain again. That technology has nothing to do with
</I>&gt;<i> setting interest/inflation/exchange rates, nor with setting lending
</I>&gt;<i> policies (the secondary purpose of central banks).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Blockchain has everything to do with breaking &quot;information asymmetrie&quot; and
who controls &quot;THE TRUTH&quot; - which is currently banks.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Removing SDAPs is impossible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Removing them from power is certainly not impossible, and in fact is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the natural result of a true direct democracy (one where *everyone*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; votes, either directly or via a personality-matched proxy).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; People already vote with money every day.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not perfect, but in this system, everyone is asked every day to
</I>&gt;<i> vote on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever suits him by BUYING something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, and the Koch brothers buy politicians this way. And you're
</I>&gt;<i> saying this is a good thing?
</I>

Who cares if politicians are bought - they play no relevant role in this
world.
The whole regular &quot;political systems&quot; we have these days are irrelevant.
The power is in the economy and how people spend money.



&gt;<i> Economic and political systems are two
</I>&gt;<i> different things, and the farther you can keep them separated, the
</I>&gt;<i> better it is for the weaker/poorer members of society
</I>

I think they are meant to be the same.
There are two political systems who compete and we should merge them into
the best of both worlds.
1. monetary system &amp; economy (is what really moves reality on a daily basis
with everyone participating to some degree)
2. fairytale democracy (which has some &quot;ideals&quot; that might inspire the
rules around the &quot;real democracy&quot; which is the former (1.))



&gt;<i> because the
</I>&gt;<i> government can't be used to control them the way money can.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In fact, the government is used for that or does it all by itself.
Sorry - I wish you good luck with your &quot;matchism&quot;, but I think we are too
far away in our perceptions of reality, that discussion makes any sense.
In addition I think I once was discussing systems proposed by people on
this or other mailinglists and the same goes for alternative monetary
systems.
I woke up from this - and even though those ideas had often interesting
inspirational aspects, in the end it's more about how to virally change the
world for the better.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The UK started to teach every kid in the entire nation how to program and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other countries will sooner or later follow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are tons of reports that you can google that estimate 50-80% of
</I>&gt;<i> todays
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jobs will be automated or taken over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by machines in the next 5-10 years, depending on whom you follow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Every job will involve some sort of knowledge about programming. It's the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; literacy of the future and it doesn't care if someone believes it or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been a programmer for 40 or so years now, made my fortune and
</I>&gt;<i> retired based on a product that enables non-professionals to program
</I>&gt;<i> (indeed it *is* the product Scotland is using to fulfill that UK
</I>&gt;<i> mandate), and yet I certainly don't believe it ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
great :-) That sounds awesome. congratulation.
So you were an employee for your whole life and the company you worked for
created that product.
The good thing about educating people about programming is, the future will
be brighter :-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Block chain looks to me like nothing more than a high-tech
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; version of the gold standard, and that's the economic equivalent of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Anthropogenic Climate Change denial (i.e., 97% of economists will tell
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you it's just unworkable).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So you don't understand it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Blockchain technology does not mean BITCOIN.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. check for example &quot;ethereum.org&quot; they offer decentralised contracts
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a &quot;crypto coin&quot; with built in inflation - there will never be a max
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number of coins.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Ether&quot; is not a fiat currency, which means it's a non-starter as the
</I>&gt;<i> basis of a monetary system.
</I>

It is a fiat currency although all the blockchain based currencies are
debatable, because they are not &quot;debt based&quot;, even though some say not
obviously debt based
