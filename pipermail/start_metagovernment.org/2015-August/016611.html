I can certainly understand that: We're not only expecting people to
contribute their time without payment, but can't even offer the
possibility of a rich payout at the end like any business startup
can...

&gt;<i> we are now on the 5th year from the beginning of the project and we have not

</I>
I'm confused. I'm not sure where I got the idea that various
governments were funding Airesis, at least by contributing computing
resources and developer time. Has it been *all* volunteer since the
start? What changed that you need to do external fundraising now?

&gt;<i> This analysis does not take into consideration the amount of  similar web
</I>&gt;<i> site popping out, I have my children giving up Khanacademy because their
</I>&gt;<i> school purchase a similar platform where they are &quot;forced to go&quot; because the
</I>&gt;<i> professors of their school dictate them.
</I>
There are a lot of these in the US too. They're not doing well:
Graduation rates are very low and there are many horror stories of
kids having to return to regular public schools and retake entire
grades to make up what they didn't learn in their on-line school. But
IMHO the problem is not the schools, it's the quality of the students
they're attracting (i.e., it's apparently not the best and brightest
switching, it's the kids who were struggling with public school to
begin with). But this shouldn't matter, at least if there weren't
SDAPs and others with vested interests in charge: There should be a
standard (core) curriculum and a student should be able to test out of
*anything*. Establishing that would quickly separate out the good from
the bad. And if the kids in a particular school don't make progress
(again, as measured by their test scores), their accreditation goes
away to make room for a competitor that will deliver.

We need to be able to ask the question of whether Kahn Academy is
better than your local public school. It's unanswerable now because
not only do we lack the metrics to do that assessment, but it'd be
impossible to even get the public school system to participate in this
sort of comparison because of their monopolistic and anti-competitive
mindset. Which is, again, something a true direct democracy could
solve, but IMHO won't ever be solved otherwise.

&gt;&gt;<i> So, my conclusion is that funding is not really the problem and that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you really do have to rely on volunteers to do the heavy lifting. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the project really is viable (or can be made so by repeated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reinvention) the volunteers will stick around long enough to spread
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the ideas out into the general population.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The experience is that volunteer come and go after a while for exhaustion
</I>&gt;<i> and sometime because they loose the faith or seeing the goal too far.
</I>
Sure, this is always the case. But by &quot;volunteers&quot; I don't mean any
*particular* volunteer, just the set working on that project as a
whole.

&gt;&gt;<i> If it's not, better it die
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or scale back until the necessary breakthrough can be made/discovered.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this model the only significant financial needs are server time,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is pretty cheap (at least compared with paying for things like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rent and salaries).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The interface start to shine but the agile production method and constant
</I>&gt;<i> little upgrades are making the testing very demanding and still we have bugs
</I>&gt;<i> here and there to fix.
</I>&gt;<i> The major work is to programme it and add the function we deliberate.
</I>&gt;<i> Is not easy to find volunteer
</I>
Again, my response to this is that it indicates that there is
something missing in the philosophy. Sure, there's always going to be
grunt work, but if you can't inspire *passion* in the volunteers, your
goals are either insufficiently bold, or perhaps in the wrong place
entirely. For example, a system that is founded on working with
existing government IMHO is one of the things that will drive *away*
volunteers, not encourage them. The goal at the start has to be to
*replace* the existing system, not supplement it.

&gt;<i> Most of the funds goes into programming and we are recently screen few ruby
</I>&gt;<i> programmer to work at the platform, there is one president of the
</I>&gt;<i> association that have given so much and not only he does not get paid but he
</I>&gt;<i> invest some time hoping to get back his &quot;loan&quot;, no office rent, advertising
</I>&gt;<i> is done by the many that they use the platform and communication is done as
</I>&gt;<i> we goes along and forward. But is direct word of mouth.
</I>&gt;<i> A social media that is not much fun to surf!!!
</I>&gt;<i> For the moment I like to see popping out different languages version
</I>&gt;<i> www.airesis.info
</I>
Just for me, I'd rather see more quality than quantity. There are lots
of flaws even on the web site, and my recollection is that the
software was the same way (buttons that didn't work, a tutorial that
got stuck, etc.). Much better to find a niche and fill it well and
completely than try to solve every problem (and in every country) all
at once. And not to appear American (English) chauvinistic, but if you
believe that the problem is that there is insufficient critical mass
in any one country, better to put 100% of the wood behind the one
arrow that is the English language version because that by far is the
biggest potential market (indeed, as the most widely spoken second
language in the world, you could have more success with a solid
English version than if you supported every other language *combined*
if each of those others is even a little bit flaky or incomplete).
