</I>&gt;<i> Right, all I'm arguing, contrary to your initial proposal, is that
</I>&gt;<i> central banks are a necessary component of the machine that is the
</I>&gt;<i> economy. Without them, there is no way to regulate things like
</I>&gt;<i> inflation, exchange rates, etc. and the economy will experience wild
</I>&gt;<i> boom and bust cycles. Those hurt everyone, but especially the poorest
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>

Inflation can be regulated by a decentralized mechanism.
I recommend the following video <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh9BxYTSrGU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh9BxYTSrGU</A>
Make everyone in the cryptocurrency economy vote on the inflation rate and
choose the median vote.
The inflation income should be equally distributed



&gt;<i> But maybe that does't concern you, as I sense libertarianism
</I>&gt;<i> (in the US sense) in your argument that what we should do is allow
</I>&gt;<i> money control everything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, i'd support &quot;money should control everything&quot;,
but i strongly disagree with our current monetary system, as it's rules are
horrible.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Great - sounds like someone with at least some clues - but I still think
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the not so long run - blockchain based systems will replace the
</I>&gt;<i> brokenness
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of what we have now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's still unclear to me as to how it will help at all. What is it
</I>&gt;<i> about banks that you fear, the fact that they hold the money for us,
</I>&gt;<i> or the fact that you have no control over how they use (lend) it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't fear it, I have in fact no control over how they use it and thus
they are like kings.
Their power comes from the rules that constitute central banking and not
from the people.
They holding &quot;THE TRUTH&quot; (them doing all the book keeping) is deeply flawed
if you think of
the monetary system being the real democracy.



&gt;<i> Cryptocurrencies solve the first problem, but do nothing for the
</I>&gt;<i> second.
</I>

I dont understand


&gt;<i> Mt. Gox being the great example of that, but the alternative,
</I>&gt;<i> everyone doing the digital equivalent of stuffing their money in their
</I>&gt;<i> mattresses, will stifle the economy because it will not be practical
</I>&gt;<i> to aggregate money to loan it out (which is what banks do).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There is no such thing as &quot;lending out money&quot;.
&quot;Lending out money&quot; means private banks creating new money out of thin air
and giving it to whomever they want.
People paying for loans means destroying money.
People saving money on bank accounts means &quot;freezing money&quot;, so that
chances are more money can be created
through loans, because the economy needs a replacement for the money that
was frozen.

Other than that - wallets can bake in a mechanism to slowly redistribute
money or devaluate money which is being hoarded.
Blockchain technology is free to do whatever you want. It's just a
decentralized and distributed database.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Blockchain has everything to do with breaking &quot;information asymmetrie&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who controls &quot;THE TRUTH&quot; - which is currently banks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do I care that the bank knows how much money I have on deposit,
</I>&gt;<i> or have borrowed from them?
</I>

People don't and that's the problem.
I don't care that you tell it to the banks and giving them power.
I care that you do not share it with every person on the face of earth.
By choosing to only giving that information to your bank - the same as
basically everyone else - you empower them by granting them
information asymmetrie - making them the ruler.



&gt;<i> That isn't even where the problem is, it's
</I>&gt;<i> in the policies they have that control who gets loans and how much
</I>&gt;<i> interest they pay and so on.
</I>

Sure - both. But at the core of everything is information asymmetry.
That being too abstract - i'm fine with blaming the rules around central
banking,
because changing them in a positive way will crack the more abstract
problem too



&gt;<i> Crytocurrencies do nothing to change
</I>&gt;<i> that. Direct democracy, on the other hand, deals specifically with
</I>&gt;<i> those issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
the right kind of crypto currency will cause the best possible direct
democracy for its users.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Right, and the Koch brothers buy politicians this way. And you're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; saying this is a good thing?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Who cares if politicians are bought - they play no relevant role in this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; world.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The whole regular &quot;political systems&quot; we have these days are irrelevant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The power is in the economy and how people spend money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, just like central banks, politicians *do* play a crucial role
</I>&gt;<i> in the current systems, and cryptocurrencies would do nothing to
</I>&gt;<i> change that. I agree that getting rid of them *would* be a good thing,
</I>&gt;<i> but is only possible if a robust decision-making system can be built
</I>&gt;<i> to replace them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We have the most robust decision making system where everyone participates
already.
It's called economy. And decision is to BUY something :-)




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Economic and political systems are two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; different things, and the farther you can keep them separated, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; better it is for the weaker/poorer members of society
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think they are meant to be the same.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are two political systems who compete and we should merge them into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the best of both worlds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. monetary system &amp; economy (is what really moves reality on a daily
</I>&gt;<i> basis
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with everyone participating to some degree)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. fairytale democracy (which has some &quot;ideals&quot; that might inspire the
</I>&gt;<i> rules
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around the &quot;real democracy&quot; which is the former (1.))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This kind of philosophy is shared by most US libertarians. It's cruel,
</I>&gt;<i> naive, and in many cases requires an almost pathological denial of how
</I>&gt;<i> the real world works (e.g., it would consider the fact that SDAPs
</I>&gt;<i> currently control the power in the world to either be irrelevant or
</I>&gt;<i> possibly even a good thing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's only cruel with our current central banking which is deeply flawed in
basically every possible way.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; because the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; government can't be used to control them the way money can.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In fact, the government is used for that or does it all by itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How? If the people make the rules themselves, how can the &quot;government&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> be used to control them?
</I>

The only direct democracy that works on a daily basis will be one where
people can vote all the time
on everything - and that's pretty closely related to money if you think of
those votes casted all the time
as &quot;money&quot;.



&gt;<i> The problem with representative democracy is
</I>&gt;<i> that the people making the rules are psychologically (and in most
</I>&gt;<i> cases philosophically) *different* from The People as a whole. Put The
</I>&gt;<i> People (or truly representative proxies) in charge and the decisions
</I>&gt;<i> and policies made will more closely reflect what is best for them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes - a reform of the monetary system to merge &quot;money&quot; with &quot;democracy&quot;
will do the trick i believe.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry - I wish you good luck with your &quot;matchism&quot;, but I think we are too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; far away in our perceptions of reality, that discussion makes any sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In addition I think I once was discussing systems proposed by people on
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or other mailinglists and the same goes for alternative monetary systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the disagreements on this list seem to me to be about how to
</I>&gt;<i> *implement* direct democracy. I see very little disagreement, except
</I>&gt;<i> from you, that direct democracy *is* the appropriate goal. By focusing
</I>&gt;<i> on an economic solution to our problems, you seem to me to be
</I>&gt;<i> proposing to just ignore the issue of government and decisionmaking
</I>&gt;<i> entirely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

No, not ignoring them, but we already have a mechanism in place that is
used by everyone everyday everywhere.
It's called BUYING and it means casting votes for something (money).
There are individuals buying for themselves or others, groups buying for
themselves or others, kickstarters of the world to fund stuff.
All kinds of techniques are already being applied everywhere t make
deciscions that actually move the world every day.

So why not think about the rules around money, because it's already pretty
close.
Maybe everything can be turned into awesome if you tweak those rules a bit.



&gt;<i> &gt; great :-) That sounds awesome. congratulation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So you were an employee for your whole life and the company you worked
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; created that product.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was an employee for a handful of companies, then a
</I>&gt;<i> contractor/consultant for a dozen more, then started my own company
</I>&gt;<i> (living the dream, or stereotype, depending on your perspective).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The good thing about educating people about programming is, the future
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be brighter :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds to me like proposing that everyone learn how to do surgery or
</I>&gt;<i> grow their own food.
</I>


I recommend another video:
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=54&amp;v=7Pq-S557XQU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=54&amp;v=7Pq-S557XQU</A>
HUMANS NEED NOT APPLY.

Programming is already the new literacy.
People who cannot program are like people who could not read and write.
How can you seriously participate in the future without being a programer
of some sort?
Maybe watch the video.



&gt;<i> It's just not how civilization works, and
</I>&gt;<i> proposing that programming is somehow different from any other
</I>&gt;<i> specialization just sounds naive to me. Maybe I've got the same
</I>&gt;<i> delusion about teaching people psychology so that they can recognize
</I>&gt;<i> and control their Clinations, but at least it's not just a mundane and
</I>&gt;<i> niche skill like programming or moneylending...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

That is the probem:
*&quot;MONEY LENDING (=Creation)&quot; *decides who governs and you say its not
important
*&quot;PROGRAMMING (=new literacy)&quot;* decides who can participate in the society
of tomorrow
