<PRE>+1 @ Scott Raney

@Fred Gohlke
I don't want to demotivate you.
Maybe the best you could do is open peoples eyes. Switch the budget to
bitcoin.

Maybe explore *BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY*
Inspiration could come from:
<A HREF="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/21399/london-mayoral-candidate-wants-track-17-billion-city-budget-real-time-blockchain/">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/21399/london-mayoral-candidate-wants-track-17-billion-city-budget-real-time-blockchain/</A>

*Just think about the following:*
*Each &quot;unit of money&quot; is a vote*

   - Successful selling or fundraising = Being elected
   - Buying or Donating = Voting

Now there is a flaw with our current money. A completely passive
politician, sitting on all his votes, doing nothing with his power gains
more power over time.
A Politician who is highly active and spends all his votes loses all his
power - BUT: if done right has the chance to be re-elected.

Now imagine the amount of votes in a society is finite and some elected
politicians hoard all the votes and do not use them, then the rest of the
society is forced into some kind of &quot;standby mode&quot;, because they cannot
vote on each other to elect each other in order to do something for them.
Everyone needs to wait for the few elected ones to start voting on
something to re-gain the votes they spend on the ones hoarding them all.

But of course, there is a way out - instead of waiting for powerful
politicians (which means here - those who have a lot of votes behind them -
which here stands for money) - certain institutions, let's call them
&quot;BANKS&quot;, can lend money to those who are found to be &quot;trustworthy&quot;.
So &quot;BANKS&quot; as representatives of &quot;ALL THE PEOPLE&quot; decide to give votes to
certain politicians... and because &quot;BANKS&quot; are not really representatives,
let's call it &quot;LOANS&quot; instead, which means the politicians elected by banks
have to re-elect banks in the future, giving them the same or even more
votes back.

... which in reality works like a charm i guess (Just think of governments
in debt around the world - a current example shows in the soap opera
&quot;greece&quot; vs. &quot;germany&quot;)

Just for inspiration - start equating &quot;economy &amp; money&quot; with &quot;democracy &amp;
votes&quot; and contemplate a bit of what &quot;money &amp; economy&quot; means in this light,
if you apply the knowledge of &quot;political science&quot;, or whatever your
background is, to that.


*One more note:*
Now in this light - take a look at the article I posted above and maybe
you'll find some ways of how you can make real change or at least educate
the people about the problem domain using the power you gained through
being elected.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm sad to say, that it's hard for me to imagine what politicians could
</I>&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to improve the situation of people in their everyday life.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can see how &quot;business&quot; can and does change the every day life of
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's about whether people earn money,    because MONEY = VOTES, it gives
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people the power to vote on what they want others to do for them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's about whether people spend money, because MONEY = VOTES, it gives
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people the power to vote on what they want others to do for them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most people have very few &quot;votes&quot; and need to earn more in order to get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most people have NO SAY in how they do business and earn money - even
</I>&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they choose their profession, the decide early in their life and
</I>&gt;<i> transition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not trivial.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is how REAL DEMOCRACY works!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. MONEY = VOTES
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. BUYING = VOTING
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. SELLING = BEING a CANDIDATE that others can VOTE for :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AND YES...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The way our current money works is pretty flawed and so our &quot;REAL
</I>&gt;<i> DEMOCRACY&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is pretty broken, but to make it work, the rules around democracy (which
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how money works), needs to be fixed, to make it mean something in the
</I>&gt;<i> ways i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; describe above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The ECONOMY is our real democracy and people buy/sell every day and thus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; participate EVERY DAY.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We need to UPGRADE this democracy, by:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. fixing money (and talk about what could be fixed)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. augmenting it with all kinds of apps/meetings/events/activities that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inform people better and guide this democracy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The FAKE BULLSHIT (which is voting every couple of years on which party
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (they are the same anyways) gets king for a period of time) has to
</I>&gt;<i> disolve.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This might sound radical, but please step back for a while and imagine,
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; money would work not as it works today with central banks and rigged
</I>&gt;<i> rules
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (see europe/greece), but in the best possible version you could imagine -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; basically some kind of utopia/fairytale currency... (which might not be
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; far away from today if you have ever heard of a technology called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;BLOCKCHAIN&quot;) ...so under this light, maybe what i describe as &quot;REAL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DEMOCRACY&quot; makes sense? :-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Good Morning, Alexander
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thank you for taking the time to comment on my posts.  The differences
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; our views are so extreme that reconciling them is unlikely.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That's unfortunate.  The political situation in Frome, U.K. is unusual.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It offers a unique opportunity to empower all those people in the
</I>&gt;<i> community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; who have the desire and the ability to influence Frome's future.  I
</I>&gt;<i> thought
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; your recognition of the need for people to collaborate in constructive
</I>&gt;<i> ways
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; might offer a basis for thinking through specific suggestions the Town
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Council might consider.  It does not seem so.
