<PRE>I see everyone badmouthing money but at the same time, &quot;I'm looking to
the future when I get paid back&quot;. there is no need to change the gov.
in fact that doesn't work. People will only change as much as &quot;YOU&quot;
do. A system outside of gov. is the only answer. To be more plain,
those ole boys will die as soon as the well runs dry.
promote FREE MARKET DEMOCRACY trust yourself to govern yourself &quot;YOU&quot;
are SOCIETY

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; we are now on the 5th year from the beginning of the project and we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; get a penny from the government, at the European level we fail on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; two
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; proposal and we see that the way is managed does fall almost in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; power
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; abuse
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; over the discretionality and absolute immunity  of their decisions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm confused. I'm not sure where I got the idea that various
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; governments were funding Airesis, at least by contributing computing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; resources and developer time. Has it been *all* volunteer since the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; start? What changed that you need to do external fundraising now?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It was just a true statement and we are proud to being able to maintain
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> autonomy and to follow our internal fully democratic rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eh, I'm still confused. If there is no government funding or control,
</I>&gt;<i> what changed that made you need to seek external funding sources now?
</I>&gt;<i> And what was all that about officials not following through?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; We need to be able to ask the question of whether Kahn Academy is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; better than your local public school. It's unanswerable now because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; not only do we lack the metrics to do that assessment, but it'd be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; impossible to even get the public school system to participate in this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; sort of comparison because of their monopolistic and anti-competitive
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; mindset. Which is, again, something a true direct democracy could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; solve, but IMHO won't ever be solved otherwise.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do agree, in Italy there is ground for huge improvement and in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> september
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ther will be a group of teachers testing Airesis to  try to design a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> school
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reform by themself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll stick my neck out and make a prediction: The approved changes
</I>&gt;<i> will be minimal and all involve the administration rather than any
</I>&gt;<i> changes to curriculum or standards. Don't know if you've got teacher's
</I>&gt;<i> unions there like we have in US, but they are remarkable examples of
</I>&gt;<i> why public employee unions are a really bad idea (unless you're
</I>&gt;<i> employee who falls well below average in competence, of course).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (big snip)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is contrasting energies in the group, who like me want to replace
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old system,  who want to  just provide the best tool for e-democracy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the assumption that a revolution will not occur and to replace the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> imply entering by the back door and slowly changing it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am for the critical mass  way, where by some sort of media stunt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attention
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is driven to the tool and loud mass voice shut up the current system, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of peaceful revolution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. And this doesn't require any close interaction between your
</I>&gt;<i> (our) new systems and the existing systems. I look at the success of
</I>&gt;<i> petition-oriented organizations like Avaaz and Move-On as a model
</I>&gt;<i> (success as measured by participation rates, not that they actually
</I>&gt;<i> achieve anything directly because there is no actual decisionmaking
</I>&gt;<i> involved ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the main problem is the opensource text editor! Is buggy and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sometime
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make writing or editing a proposal a challenge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, having to use the web as a platform is a serious handicap. It
</I>&gt;<i> ranks up there with the most poorly designed architectures I've ever
</I>&gt;<i> seen. Which is why at least for my first versions I will only have
</I>&gt;<i> token support for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The next challenge is the mobile app!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's where I'm starting, and I believe is the future of the Internet:
</I>&gt;<i> Mobile users (me included) really hate web apps and much prefer an app
</I>&gt;<i> designed to run natively on their platform. IMHO if Microsoft had
</I>&gt;<i> produced a decent app store 30 years ago instead of that abomination
</I>&gt;<i> ActiveX, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
