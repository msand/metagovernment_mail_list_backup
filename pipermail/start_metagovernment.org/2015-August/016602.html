Very sorry to hear this, but then, I can't say I'm surprised:
eDemocracy, at least to the extent that it facilitates Direct
Democracy, represents an existential threat to the powers-that-be. Any
project that becomes even the least bit successful will immediately be
shunned by them, and if it is possible, they will work to cut of
funding or any other form of support. Counting on government funding
from the start will only hasten the project's demise IMHO.

&gt;<i> Does any of you have any Idea on how to subsidize an Edemocracy project?
</I>
Eventually it must be subsidized by The People. My plan is to
institute a voluntary &quot;tax&quot; of some small yet significant amount (say,
1% of income) that people will have a moral obligation to pay if they
participate in the system. That of course only handles the transition
from start-up phase to actual implementation as THE government, i.e.,
after it has sufficient momentum that a significant number of people
start to believe that it will actually (eventually) become the
government.

As for how to get to that point, one obvious answer would seem to be
crowdfunding. I'm a little skeptical that this will really work for
early-stage funding, however. You'd either have to have a really good
sales pitch or a big name behind you to convince people that it's
really viable. But even that is no guarantee of success: I look at the
stalled momentum of Kahn Academy (<A HREF="https://www.khanacademy.org/">https://www.khanacademy.org/</A>) as a
prime example of this. In a sense it is very similar kind of project,
taking power from existing institutions and distributing it to The
People. And it has everything going for it, plenty of users, plenty of
funding, and many big names (including things like Bill Gates
promoting it at TED conferences). But near as I can tell, adoption of
it has stalled (e.g., look at
<A HREF="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=kahn%20academy">https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=kahn%20academy</A>). IMHO this is
primarily because of the exact same problem you're (and we're all)
facing, which is resistance from the establishment.

So, my conclusion is that funding is not really the problem and that
you really do have to rely on volunteers to do the heavy lifting. If
the project really is viable (or can be made so by repeated
reinvention) the volunteers will stick around long enough to spread
the ideas out into the general population. If it's not, better it die
or scale back until the necessary breakthrough can be made/discovered.
In this model the only significant financial needs are server time,
which is pretty cheap (at least compared with paying for things like
rent and salaries).

&gt;<i> Donation are coming in but are not sufficient and the lack of interest from
</I>&gt;<i> the general public, apart the volunteer that are giving great amount of time
</I>&gt;<i> and effort to keep it going.
</I>&gt;<i> From my perspective the only way is to form an Edemocracy movement purely
</I>&gt;<i> based on edemocracy. But all of you know that even there we need a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> money...
</I>
What do you need the money for, exactly? Paying programmers,
administrators, office space, advertising? Most startups that go into
business with this mindset fail, and usually fairly quickly. Better to
search for the idea(s) that will keep volunteers interested than in
working to design and support all that overhead. That is the way all
revolutions in the past have come about. Maybe a meme for this is &quot;The
Revolution Won't Be Crowdfunded&quot; ;-)
