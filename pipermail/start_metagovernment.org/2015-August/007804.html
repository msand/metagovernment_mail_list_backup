2 months! That must be some kind of record! By comparison, this reply
is only a month late ;-)

&gt;<i> Fair enough. I think editing posts are asking for trouble and confusion
</I>&gt;<i> though. Edits gives power to the proposer to try and manipulate the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion by restarting it each time they preform an edit. It's easier for

</I>&gt;<i> will flow smoothly because no one can just change what they said which might
</I>&gt;<i> make the rest of the thread not make sense.
</I>
My conception is that proposals are not a &quot;conversation&quot;, they're more
like software upgrades (i.e., they will be few and far between). If
someone is doing a daily &quot;upgrade&quot; to the proposal or has to do more
than a handful of releases to get a usable product out, people will
quickly lose interest and the proposal will just wither and die.

&gt;<i> But juries aren't an attainable position, they are assigned randomly.
</I>
LOL! You've obviously never sat through a jury selection process. Last
time I was called (a few months ago, for a drug possession trial),
there were 80 people called to fill 12 spots and lots of maneuvering
to get out of serving. Having a PhD I had a huge advantage over them,
and a 15-second spiel about my belief that our &quot;war on drugs&quot; is a
clear demonstration of how social conservatives have coopted our legal
system for their own purposes ensured I would be excused (i.e. I
simply stated that their goal is to facilitate punishment rather than
to protect us all from criminal behavior,  a viewnI find alien and
barbaric but which is held by most Authoritarians). The people left
(who returned a unanimous guilty verdict, BTW) were the people who
*wanted* to serve. IMHO the people who serve on juries, just like the
people who desire to serve in representative government, are exactly
the wrong people to take on those roles.

&gt;<i> Say
</I>&gt;<i> the site picks 10 random users and asked them to uphold the rules of the
</I>&gt;<i> site e.g. no hate speech. Get the 10 to decide if the post made qualifies as
</I>&gt;<i> hate speech. If found guilty - time penatly from posting.
</I>
Again, wrong people making the decision, wrong remedy when a
problematic post occurs. Why go to all the trouble to censor someone
when you can instead just give people the tools to filter them, which
avoids all the freedom of speech issues?

Note that I'm not opposed to this sort of &quot;sampling&quot; to try to reduce
bias in general, I'm just inclined to think that it's a weak method
because unless you find some way to *ensure* that everyone who's
called actually casts a vote, the &quot;randomness&quot; you seek is an
illusion.

&gt;<i> Have rules of the site, if you can't follow them you can't post, seems like
</I>&gt;<i> a equally valid method of dealing with trolls. This assumes we can guarantee
</I>&gt;<i> only one account per person though. Otherwise it's a lost cause either way.
</I>
Remember, this is not a &quot;site&quot; we're talking about, it's the
government. *Any* proposal that requires excluding people is a
non-starter IMHO.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But my argument is that it's better being an actual public job that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can see happen online. Getting multiple people to submit redrafts will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ensure the best summarization of proposals and encourage a standard of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've no problem with professionals (indeed paid professionals) doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most of the work. That's what the Managers are in the Matchism
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal, and where I expect most of the proposals will come from. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just have a problem with paying *everyone* to do this kind of work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because unless you have a very sophisticated bidding and management
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system (something like what Ned has proposed with Blinap) it just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems to me to open up too many avenues for gaming the system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not everyone is getting paid, only the one's who are skilled re-drafters.
</I>&gt;<i> The managers in your system are getting chosen and paid by the public as
</I>&gt;<i> well no? Same concept, experts in the field.
</I>
Who picks the re-drafters?

&gt;<i> The capitalist system's is driven by the profit motive in money that
</I>&gt;<i> theoretically would destroy everything around it to achieve that profit. Our
</I>&gt;<i> system's driven by the motive of well being to the greatest number of
</I>&gt;<i> people. I don't think that will need regulating the same way. Money is just
</I>&gt;<i> a reward for some hard work not the end goal of every proposal.
</I>
My problem with introducing payments for the people participating has
nothing do with the normal downsides of capitalism (exploitation of
resources, workers, etc.), it has to do with corruption: As soon as
you introduce a system where people expect to get paid for doing
things, they'll either stop doing them *unless* they get paid (turning
play into work) or find a way to game the system such that they end up
getting paid more than everyone else. What that results in is SDAPs
(who are the most susceptible to this type of influence) being in
charge. Which is exactly the problem with the systems we have now.
