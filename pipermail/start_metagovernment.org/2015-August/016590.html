</I>
Yeah, I'm thinking this is an extremely limiting perspective for
formulating public policy. And probably for decisionmaking in general.
Fear of making a bad choice is vastly more powerful (hence the
existence of conservatives), and I'd even be willing to bet you could
motivate more people by providing them with a sense of purpose than by
promising (or even delivering) that they'll &quot;enjoy&quot; the process of
governing.

&gt;&gt;<i> Not that I disagree with the conclusions of the paper: It seems to me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fairly obvious that people prefer to have more control over the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems that they must function in, and using the political power of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is possible that proxies are good solution. It is based on the

</I>
Or maybe simply too timeconsuming.

&gt;<i> As you know I am trying to challenge this assumption with my project
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://participedia.net/en/methods/parties-global-agora">http://participedia.net/en/methods/parties-global-agora</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I have made some advance, I will try to update the page soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Later I will probably allow for some proxies in my project too, but
</I>&gt;<i> first of all I would like to try to boost participation and spread of
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>
Higher participation rates has got to be a design goal in *any* system
that effectively deals with SDAPs: Their participation rates are just
naturally higher and you need to either suppress that or bring in more
Neurotypicals to compensate. But a matched-proxy based system is the
only thing I've been able to come up with that will achieve the vast
increase in effective participation rates we need.

&gt;<i> I do not think so. I do not talk here just about &quot;final solution&quot;. I am
</I>&gt;<i> talking about implementation strategy here as well. At the moment when
</I>&gt;<i> my movement has a few people, budget is important.
</I>
I actually don't worry about this issue much: The cost of running a
system capable of supporting even thousands of users is negligible
(other than the software development itself, of course), and when
you're able to run significantly above that number you'll have no
trouble collecting the user contributions (or grants, or whatever)
necessary to scale it up.
