Ah. In this case, I would agree that a crowdfunding option is indeed
your best option. In my experience there are two ways these can
succeed:

1) You propose to create (or maybe just finish) a product that has
great &quot;sex appeal&quot; and that people will be clamoring to get their
hands on even if they've never actually used even a prototype. Not to
poo-poo your project, or the field of electronic direct democracy in
general, but I just don't see this happening for any of us.

2) You've got a loyal and dedicated customer base that is willing to
support the project because they are *already* relying on it. That is,
your existing users will be the ones who fund you. I don't know your
community will do this for you, but if it were me, this is where I'd
concentrate my efforts. If it fails, at least you know that you need
to go back to the drawing board and create the product that at least
*some* people find indispensable.

&gt;<i> One Public Administration in a specific town that show strong interest in

</I>&gt;<i> project and we lost time to reduce the funtion available to that specific
</I>&gt;<i> admin based on their specific request. Request that we did not like but we

</I>
Right, *this* is what I was thinking was the major problem. Seems it's
only a minor problem, but my guess is that this will almost always
happen if you try to work *with* an existing government rather than
against them (i.e., as an alternative decisionmaking system).

(big snip)

&gt;<i> I am thinking loud and I believe a fantapolitic movie well done that make

</I>&gt;<i> between the tv and the internet can achieve that but so far every producer I

</I>&gt;<i> but still the production financing is a very closed system.
</I>
I agree that this would be a great marketing tool, but it seems to me
it would be better as a documentary on a small-scale system that
already *does* have a devoted fan base than a pie-in-the-sky work of
fiction. You're probably just not at the point where the fans have
sufficient influence to make a go of this yet, so again, it's back to
making that indispensable product.

    Scott
