&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thank you Scott!! very glad to see that I am in tune with your vision
</I>but is
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not easy to work unpaid and sustain  a family and a a revolutionary
</I>idea in
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; our society, at least I can speak for the Italian Situation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can certainly understand that: We're not only expecting people to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contribute their time without payment, but can't even offer the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possibility of a rich payout at the end like any business startup
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure that there is the possibility to start a company that offer
</I>Airesis as a service to a community for a fee. The association is counting
on donation to achieve the scope and we offer the online service free to
any group willing to use it.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; we are now on the 5th year from the beginning of the project and we
</I>have not
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; get a penny from the government, at the European level we fail on two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; proposal and we see that the way is managed does fall almost in power
</I>abuse
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; over the discretionality and absolute immunity  of their decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm confused. I'm not sure where I got the idea that various
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; governments were funding Airesis, at least by contributing computing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources and developer time. Has it been *all* volunteer since the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start? What changed that you need to do external fundraising now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was just a true statement and we are proud to being able to maintain
</I>autonomy and to follow our internal fully democratic rules.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This analysis does not take into consideration the amount of  similar
</I>web
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; site popping out, I have my children giving up Khanacademy because
</I>their
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; school purchase a similar platform where they are &quot;forced to go&quot;
</I>because the
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; professors of their school dictate them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are a lot of these in the US too. They're not doing well:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Graduation rates are very low and there are many horror stories of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kids having to return to regular public schools and retake entire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grades to make up what they didn't learn in their on-line school. But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMHO the problem is not the schools, it's the quality of the students
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they're attracting (i.e., it's apparently not the best and brightest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switching, it's the kids who were struggling with public school to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; begin with). But this shouldn't matter, at least if there weren't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SDAPs and others with vested interests in charge: There should be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard (core) curriculum and a student should be able to test out of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *anything*. Establishing that would quickly separate out the good from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the bad. And if the kids in a particular school don't make progress
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (again, as measured by their test scores), their accreditation goes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; away to make room for a competitor that will deliver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The social function of school should not be underestimated,  I believe
</I>that the standards must be set but we are all different and the system
should take into consideration this fact and be flexible to accomodate a
good amount of energy to try to bring as many bad to the good side.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We need to be able to ask the question of whether Kahn Academy is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better than your local public school. It's unanswerable now because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not only do we lack the metrics to do that assessment, but it'd be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impossible to even get the public school system to participate in this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sort of comparison because of their monopolistic and anti-competitive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mindset. Which is, again, something a true direct democracy could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solve, but IMHO won't ever be solved otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do agree, in Italy there is ground for huge improvement and in
</I>september ther will be a group of teachers testing Airesis to  try to
design a school reform by themself.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; So, my conclusion is that funding is not really the problem and that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; you really do have to rely on volunteers to do the heavy lifting. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; the project really is viable (or can be made so by repeated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; reinvention) the volunteers will stick around long enough to spread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; the ideas out into the general population.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The experience is that volunteer come and go after a while for
</I>exhaustion
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and sometime because they loose the faith or seeing the goal too far.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sure, this is always the case. But by &quot;volunteers&quot; I don't mean any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *particular* volunteer, just the set working on that project as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whole.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; If it's not, better it die
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; or scale back until the necessary breakthrough can be
</I>made/discovered.
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; In this model the only significant financial needs are server time,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; which is pretty cheap (at least compared with paying for things like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; rent and salaries).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The interface start to shine but the agile production method and
</I>constant
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; little upgrades are making the testing very demanding and still we
</I>have bugs
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; here and there to fix.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The major work is to programme it and add the function we deliberate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is not easy to find volunteer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, my response to this is that it indicates that there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something missing in the philosophy. Sure, there's always going to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grunt work, but if you can't inspire *passion* in the volunteers, your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; goals are either insufficiently bold, or perhaps in the wrong place
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entirely. For example, a system that is founded on working with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; existing government IMHO is one of the things that will drive *away*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; volunteers, not encourage them. The goal at the start has to be to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *replace* the existing system, not supplement it.
</I>
There is contrasting energies in the group, who like me want to replace the
old system,  who want to  just provide the best tool for e-democracy, there
is the assumption that a revolution will not occur and to replace the
system imply entering by the back door and slowly changing it.
I am for the critical mass  way, where by some sort of media stunt
attention is driven to the tool and loud mass voice shut up the current
system, a sort of peaceful revolution.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Most of the funds goes into programming and we are recently screen
</I>few ruby
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; programmer to work at the platform, there is one president of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; association that have given so much and not only he does not get paid
</I>but he
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; invest some time hoping to get back his &quot;loan&quot;, no office rent,
</I>advertising
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is done by the many that they use the platform and communication is
</I>done as
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; we goes along and forward. But is direct word of mouth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A social media that is not much fun to surf!!!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For the moment I like to see popping out different languages version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; www.airesis.info
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just for me, I'd rather see more quality than quantity. There are lots
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of flaws even on the web site, and my recollection is that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software was the same way (buttons that didn't work, a tutorial that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; got stuck, etc.). Much better to find a niche and fill it well and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; completely than try to solve every problem (and in every country) all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at once. And not to appear American (English) chauvinistic, but if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe that the problem is that there is insufficient critical mass
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in any one country, better to put 100% of the wood behind the one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arrow that is the English language version because that by far is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; biggest potential market (indeed, as the most widely spoken second
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language in the world, you could have more success with a solid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; English version than if you supported every other language *combined*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if each of those others is even a little bit flaky or incomplete).
</I>
Well is embarassing but given the resources i think no other group have
achieved a  work like ours.
The functionality to offer the platform in different languages and
localization has been much worked and is now much better especially by
dividing the proposals by languages and geographic areas. The underlying
engine is the same and hundreds of reported bugs have being fixed.
A recent overhaul reduced the code by a considerable amount of lines.
The american site airesis.us is one of the least used!
One of the main problem is the opensource text editor! Is buggy and
sometime make writing or editing a proposal a challenge.

The next challenge is the mobile app!

&gt;<i> &gt;   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Scott
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Slowly but surely... hopefully!!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thank for the meme, I will try it to communicate it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Regards
