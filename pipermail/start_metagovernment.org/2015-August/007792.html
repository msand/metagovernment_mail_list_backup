<PRE>Hello Scott,

thank you for reply. The message is mixed a little bit, I hope for
better understanding. I start answering paragraphs that were in the
middle of previous email. 


&gt;<i> This is really the realm of philosophy rather than psychology or
</I>&gt;<i> economics, but the solution to the problem clearly still requires some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of direct democracy because that is the only way to even *assess*
</I>&gt;<i> the collective good (the references cited on matchism.org providing
</I>&gt;<i> convincing evidence that allowing &quot;representatives&quot; to determine this
</I>&gt;<i> is simply bad design).
</I>
I agree.

&gt;<i> If you're interested in this, I recommend Owen
</I>&gt;<i> Flanagan's &quot;The Really Hard Problem: Meaning in a Material World&quot; as a
</I>&gt;<i> good overview, where he talks a lot about &quot;eudamonia&quot;: What is &quot;a good
</I>&gt;<i> life&quot;? He, and other philosophers, seem to generally agrees with me
</I>&gt;<i> that you can't answer that by just asking people if they are satisfied
</I>&gt;<i> or happy or whatever. Living a good life requires more than that, and
</I>&gt;<i> indeed directly conflicts with it in many cases.
</I>
Here we should distinguish between decision making process and outcome.
In decision making process I proposed to maximize pleasure in initial
design.
On the other hand when it comes to out later outcomes I am for
happiness.
The initial decision making process should be so that it allows for
pleasure and is capable to produce happy outcomes. Later as a bonus the
process might change itself into happy process producing happy
outcomes. But who would be interested in that happy-happy process now ?
Certainly less people than in some pleasure-happy process. 
(Just as a note, pleasure-pleasure process is similar to the destruction
our civilization is producing now.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.bsfrey.ch/articles/414_05.pdf">http://www.bsfrey.ch/articles/414_05.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to suggest that we should try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.maximize net *procedural* utility of social choice for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (average neurotypical) citizen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (net = positive utility - negative utility)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where the rubber hits the road in that article is the statement in
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2.: &quot;In this paper, utility is measured in terms of reported
</I>&gt;<i> subjective well-being.&quot; I'm still thrashing on this, but am generally
</I>&gt;<i> leaning toward the conclusion that maximizing *subjective* well-being
</I>&gt;<i> is not an appropriate primary goal for government design, or social
</I>&gt;<i> engineering in general. Instead there has to be a balance between the
</I>&gt;<i> collective good and an individual's wants/needs/preferences. Otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> you end up with broken systems like we currently have (especially in
</I>&gt;<i> the US) where individual &quot;freedom&quot; means freedom to smoke, carry guns,
</I>&gt;<i> eat junk food to the point that they become morbidly obese, and a wide
</I>&gt;<i> range of other behaviors that increase &quot;subjective well-being&quot; but
</I>&gt;<i> clearly conflict with what The People as a whole require to have a
</I>&gt;<i> society that is stable, efficient, and maximally beneficial to them.
</I>&gt;<i> This is especially true when people are ignorant about their
</I>&gt;<i> Clinations (e.g., they're oblivious to the fact that it's their
</I>&gt;<i> genetically-derived instincts that drives them to exhibit tribalistic
</I>&gt;<i> behavior, a source of behavior that we otherwise generally agree
</I>&gt;<i> should be deprecated).
</I>
Philosophically speaking subjectivity is everything. Objectivity is
just subjective imagination.
Practically we use it a little bit differently and when our tribe
broadly agrees about something we call it objective. So the line
between common subjective and objective is quite blurred.

Fortunatelly enough we can sum some things into categories listed under
the category of fundamental human needs
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_human_needs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_human_needs</A>
where is broad agreement across tribes about need of production of items
in this categories.
I think we should start the process with this objective needs and
consider adding some more subjective needs.

(Here used to be the initial paragraph)


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not that I disagree with the conclusions of the paper: It seems to me
</I>&gt;<i> fairly obvious that people prefer to have more control over the
</I>&gt;<i> systems that they must function in, and using the political power of
</I>&gt;<i> natives vs. foreigners in Switzerland seems to me about the best place
</I>&gt;<i> to look at this issue. I expect the effect size to be far larger once
</I>&gt;<i> we develop a general proxy-based direct democracy decisionmaking
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>
It is possible that proxies are good solution. It is based on the
assumption that deciding is boring or too dificult for most of people.
As you know I am trying to challenge this assumption with my project
<A HREF="http://participedia.net/en/methods/parties-global-agora">http://participedia.net/en/methods/parties-global-agora</A>
I have made some advance, I will try to update the page soon.

Later I will probably allow for some proxies in my project too, but
first of all I would like to try to boost participation and spread of
information.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. keep the costs within budget, where budget may range from 0 up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the limits of technological development. It depends on your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources and resources of your movement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is all, nothing more.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The utility, *quality* and *quantitity* of produced decision is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important just as a part of procedural utility.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Resources are important just if you cannot &quot;pay the bill&quot; as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; movement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I say the old performance functions are imprecise, especially those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of 1.maximum decisions for minimal economic costs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.maximum quality of decision for minimal costs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To sum it up, my performance fucntion is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most pleasurable decision-making for accepted costs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you say ? Do you think that there is something more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important than procedural utility ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking the &quot;budget&quot; you're talking about is just a measure of
</I>&gt;<i> economic efficiency and so probably doesn't need to be called out as a
</I>&gt;<i> special category. It's just one of many factors that people will use
</I>&gt;<i> when deciding whether a decision, or a decision-making system, is
</I>&gt;<i> suitable for them or not.
</I>
I do not think so. I do not talk here just about &quot;final solution&quot;. I am
talking about implementation strategy here as well. At the moment when
my movement has a few people, budget is important.
