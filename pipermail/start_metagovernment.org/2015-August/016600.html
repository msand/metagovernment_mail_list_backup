Sorry, still confused. What is legitimate government other than the
Will of the People? By making an artificial distinction between
&quot;government&quot; as &quot;them&quot; and what The People want, you're proposed
system is *designed* to fail because the types of people that want to
govern are exactly the wrong people to be allowed to do so. They'll
just ignore this &quot;feather&quot;.

&gt;<i> If a thought is worth

</I>
Agreed: By my analysis it's not just that everyone needs to have the
*ability* to express their opinion, proper functioning of the system
*requires* that they express their opinion. And if they can't do that,
they must designate a personality-matched proxy to do it for them.
Otherwise, again, you end up with SDAPs making public policy, which is
the system we have now.

&gt;<i> promote FREE MARKET DEMOCRACY trust yourself to govern yourself &quot;YOU&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> are SOCIETY
</I>
More than that &quot;you&quot; (we) are the government too.
  Regards,
    Scott
