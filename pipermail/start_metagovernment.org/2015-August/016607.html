Well, you probably know what I'm going to say, but I'll say it anyway:
I think your analysis is deeply flawed. Just as is the case with
capitalism itself, there's nothing wrong with banks themselves. The
problem is simply lack of proper regulation: They are able to game the
system by exploiting the personality characteristics of the SDAPs who
are running the government (prejudice, corruptibility, etc.) Fix the
SDAP problem, and all these problems with capitalism (austerity and
other authoritarian behavior imposed by central banks, monopolistic
behavior, massive wealth inequality, etc.) just go away. And
fortunately removing SDAPs from power is vastly simpler than changing
everyone's concept of money, let alone trying to replace it with
something that works &quot;better&quot; somehow.
