<PRE>@Scott Raney
I can't really take you serious - there are very specific things, but said
simplified, there is everything wrong with central banking, especially with
banks themselves.
There is no lack of regulation - it cannot be regulated, because financial
accounting itself is fundamentally subjective and you wear colored lenses
my friend.
I can go into detail and explain you what is wrong, but i don't even know
where to start.

=&gt; gaming the system by exploiting the personality characteristics of SDAPs
who are running central banks? ...it cannot be fixed. stop wishful thinking

The SDAP problem will be fixed by building decentralised  alternatives
where rules are so different, that SDAPs cannot succeed any longer with
their &quot;methods&quot;
Austerity is inherent to capitalism in its final stage - simplified its
like a game of monopoly, where the winner is &quot;generous&quot; to the losers just
to keep the game alive.

fixing &quot;authoritarion behavior imposed by central banks &amp; monopolistic
behavior can be solved by rethinking money in a decentralised way. it's
already being done with blockchain technology and it actually doesnt matter
if you see it or not.

Removing SDAPs is impossible
Chaning everyones perception of money is easy.
1. Early birds experiment with blockchain technology and start to use it
amongst themselves
2. Once it gains traction (it currently is gaining traction) those who
understand join
3. The old money will only be used by those who don't understand, but they
will feel how their money is not working any longer and without
understanding the details, they see how everything works better with this
&quot;new money&quot; and they will slowly switch, because it will increase their
wealth :-)
