<PRE>Hello, Scott      the email I got is good, I have noticed that all
methods that I have ever seen have a BOSS or OWNER or other GODHEAD
somewhere. Address this problem.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to suggest that we should try to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.maximize net *procedural* utility of social choice for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (average neurotypical) citizen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (net = positive utility - negative utility)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where the rubber hits the road in that article is the statement in
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2.: &quot;In this paper, utility is measured in terms of reported
</I>&gt;<i> subjective well-being.&quot; I'm still thrashing on this, but am generally
</I>&gt;<i> leaning toward the conclusion that maximizing *subjective* well-being
</I>&gt;<i> is not an appropriate primary goal for government design, or social
</I>&gt;<i> engineering in general. Instead there has to be a balance between the
</I>&gt;<i> collective good and an individual's wants/needs/preferences. Otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> you end up with broken systems like we currently have (especially in
</I>&gt;<i> the US) where individual &quot;freedom&quot; means freedom to smoke, carry guns,
</I>&gt;<i> eat junk food to the point that they become morbidly obese, and a wide
</I>&gt;<i> range of other behaviors that increase &quot;subjective well-being&quot; but
</I>&gt;<i> clearly conflict with what The People as a whole require to have a
</I>&gt;<i> society that is stable, efficient, and maximally beneficial to them.
</I>&gt;<i> This is especially true when people are ignorant about their
</I>&gt;<i> Clinations (e.g., they're oblivious to the fact that it's their
</I>&gt;<i> genetically-derived instincts that drives them to exhibit tribalistic
</I>&gt;<i> behavior, a source of behavior that we otherwise generally agree
</I>&gt;<i> should be deprecated).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is really the realm of philosophy rather than psychology or
</I>&gt;<i> economics, but the solution to the problem clearly still requires some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of direct democracy because that is the only way to even *assess*
</I>&gt;<i> the collective good (the references cited on matchism.org providing
</I>&gt;<i> convincing evidence that allowing &quot;representatives&quot; to determine this
</I>&gt;<i> is simply bad design). If you're interested in this, I recommend Owen
</I>&gt;<i> Flanagan's &quot;The Really Hard Problem: Meaning in a Material World&quot; as a
</I>&gt;<i> good overview, where he talks a lot about &quot;eudamonia&quot;: What is &quot;a good
</I>&gt;<i> life&quot;? He, and other philosophers, seem to generally agrees with me
</I>&gt;<i> that you can't answer that by just asking people if they are satisfied
</I>&gt;<i> or happy or whatever. Living a good life requires more than that, and
</I>&gt;<i> indeed directly conflicts with it in many cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not that I disagree with the conclusions of the paper: It seems to me
</I>&gt;<i> fairly obvious that people prefer to have more control over the
</I>&gt;<i> systems that they must function in, and using the political power of
</I>&gt;<i> natives vs. foreigners in Switzerland seems to me about the best place
</I>&gt;<i> to look at this issue. I expect the effect size to be far larger once
</I>&gt;<i> we develop a general proxy-based direct democracy decisionmaking
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. keep the costs within budget, where budget may range from 0 up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the limits of technological development. It depends on your resources
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and resources of your movement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is all, nothing more.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The utility, *quality* and *quantitity* of produced decision is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important just as a part of procedural utility.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Resources are important just if you cannot &quot;pay the bill&quot; as a movement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I say the old performance functions are imprecise, especially those of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.maximum decisions for minimal economic costs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.maximum quality of decision for minimal costs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To sum it up, my performance fucntion is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most pleasurable decision-making for accepted costs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you say ? Do you think that there is something more important
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than procedural utility ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking the &quot;budget&quot; you're talking about is just a measure of
</I>&gt;<i> economic efficiency and so probably doesn't need to be called out as a
</I>&gt;<i> special category. It's just one of many factors that people will use
</I>&gt;<i> when deciding whether a decision, or a decision-making system, is
</I>&gt;<i> suitable for them or not.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kind regards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> m.
