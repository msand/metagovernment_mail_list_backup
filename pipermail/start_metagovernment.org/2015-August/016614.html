Only if you think a key part of banking is regulation and governance.
If I replace the Board of Directors of GM with a direct-democracy
built on shareholder votes, is GM now in the hamburger business? The
primary purpose of central banks is to issue (fiat) currency. Changing
who decides when and how much currency to issue doesn't change that.
The problem with central banks is that the elites can use their access
to game the system, manipulating things like interest, inflation, and
foreign exchange rates, and tweaking policies that apply to all banks,
to benefit themselves and their cronies at the expense of rest of us.

(big snip)

&gt;<i> will be equally distributed to all &quot;THE PEOPLE&quot;, which will cause a &quot;BASIC

</I>
Argh. They're starting to debate this in Finland now. They're clueless
as social engineers. I've described system on matchism.org that I
think will actually solve this problem, but it's a lot different from
any sort of minimum wage or &quot;basic income&quot;, neither of which work
properly because they don't take into account basic economics or human
nature.

&gt;&gt;<i> Central banks are *necessary* to do those things in any non-trivial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economic system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's not true. And if not put forth by the current establishment,
</I>&gt;<i> blockchain technology will prove in the near future.
</I>
Ah, the magic blockchain again. That technology has nothing to do with
setting interest/inflation/exchange rates, nor with setting lending
policies (the secondary purpose of central banks).

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Removing SDAPs is impossible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Removing them from power is certainly not impossible, and in fact is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the natural result of a true direct democracy (one where *everyone*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> votes, either directly or via a personality-matched proxy).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People already vote with money every day.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not perfect, but in this system, everyone is asked every day to vote on
</I>&gt;<i> whatever suits him by BUYING something.
</I>
Right, and the Koch brothers buy politicians this way. And you're
saying this is a good thing? Economic and political systems are two
different things, and the farther you can keep them separated, the
better it is for the weaker/poorer members of society because the
government can't be used to control them the way money can.

&gt;<i> The UK started to teach every kid in the entire nation how to program and

</I>&gt;<i> There are tons of reports that you can google that estimate 50-80% of todays

</I>&gt;<i> Every job will involve some sort of knowledge about programming. It's the

</I>
I've been a programmer for 40 or so years now, made my fortune and
retired based on a product that enables non-professionals to program
(indeed it *is* the product Scotland is using to fulfill that UK
mandate), and yet I certainly don't believe it ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Block chain looks to me like nothing more than a high-tech

</I>
&quot;Ether&quot; is not a fiat currency, which means it's a non-starter as the
basis of a monetary system. Now maybe you could add a central bank
that could dick around with the supply to maybe provide this
flexibility, but I suspect the cryptophiliacs who are jumping all over
these things won't take too kindly to that...
