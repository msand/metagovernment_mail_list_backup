<PRE>Six people have responded to the poll, and there are three slots which can accommodate five people, but none which work for all six.

Pietro and Jonas... any chance one of you could be more flexible?

Also, is anyone else planning on attending? If so, please fill out the poll. The last audio meeting was very engaging and useful, and this one should be quite good as well.

Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> This weekend, we will be meeting to explore some interesting ways we can organize without being tied to specific national or procedural requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> David Bovill has done a good deal of research on the topic previously, so he will be presenting a proposed course of action.I think his ideas are novel and workable, but it would be very helpful if others would give their opinions. If enough of us attend, we can call this a decision-making meeting, and come out of it with a real plan of action.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you make it? At the moment, it looks like it will be at 1500 GMT this Saturday, January 7. Vote in the poll to let us know when you will be available:
