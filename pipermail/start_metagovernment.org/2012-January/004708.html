<PRE>Dear all,

It appears that the OVN forum might be shut down soon [1].  If nobody
objects, then I propose we temporarily continue our discussion [2]
here in the Metagov list, at least till our situation is resolved.  I
think all participants are subscribed here.

Replying to Stephen and C:

Stephen wrote:
&gt;<i> Ok... I think I get it. I've been imagining this working group is
</I>&gt;<i> developing rules for the Network... when actually these rules are
</I>&gt;<i> solely for &quot;a working group&quot; within the Network?
</I>
Yes, or soley for the particular working group that's responsible for
the Network, which is us.  Our name is confusing.  I might have chosen
wrong.  Maybe we could re-dub ourselves the &quot;Outcast Voting Network&quot;?
Then we might have this terminology:

  outcast
      A member of the working group.

      &quot;I am an outcast.&quot;

  outcasts
      Members of the working group, or the working group as a whole.

      &quot;We are the outcasts.&quot;

  Outcast (or the Network)
      The architecture (broad design) that is common to all networks:
      <A HREF="http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture">http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture</A>

      Identical to: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A>

      &quot;Outcast is the world's most comprehensive design for
      e-democracy.&quot;

  network
      A particular cluster of cross-mirroring vote-servers that are
      centered on a single pollwiki.  Most commonly this would be a
      local network, e.g. dedicated to a particular city.  But it
      might also be federal, organizational or global:
      <A HREF="http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture">http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture</A>

      &quot;Why does Berlin have 12 vote-servers in their network, and
      Kalamazoo only has 2?&quot;

&gt;<i> And the purpose of this working group (other than to practice using
</I>&gt;<i> the tools) is to develop, oversee, and/or advance the Network
</I>&gt;<i> or... what? I&#8217;m not sure I understand the difference between the OVN
</I>&gt;<i> and the OVN working group.
</I>
The purpose of the working group (at least as I foresaw it) is defined
on our home page: <A HREF="http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network">http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network</A>

  Our aim is to ensure that: (A) no willing participant is excluded
  from the development of the technologies and practices of primary
  voting and consensus making within Occupy; (B) no alternative
  toolset, platform or practice is excluded from the overall
  development effort; and (C) each user may freely choose a provider,
  toolset and practices based on personal needs and preferences
  without thereby becoming isolated from other users who make
  different choices.

But this is open to discussion: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/G/p/hovn">http://zelea.com/w/G/p/hovn</A>

All of this *is* rather confusing, I agree.  It's a big design.
There's no easy way to understand *any* comprehensive system of
democracy - even looking across our own borders, the differences in
traditional systems can be very confusing - never mind something
that's radically different.  On top of it, there's all the
organizational and political stuff (working group, Occupy, relations
with existing political systems) which only adds to the complexity.

</I>
So again, this concerns voting on the working group's own issues (what
should our home page say?  who should be treasurer?).  The suggestion
is that anyone's vote counts, provided it was cast within our
mirroring network.  Right?  What do others think?
