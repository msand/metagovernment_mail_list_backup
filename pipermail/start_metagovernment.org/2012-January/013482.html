<PRE>OK, let me walk through a bit of my experience and ask some questions...

You have made a proposal:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/govn">http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/govn</A>

However, you are voting for me, as indicated by this vote page which is associated with the above because it ends in G!p!govn (right?):
<A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!govn">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!govn</A>

From that page, since the focus is on me (as indicated by the &quot;u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&quot; in the URL), then if I click on the page-like icon (leftmost of the three at the top-right of the page), I am taken to the (non-existant) draft that belongs to me:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Ed-EdpastoreCom/G/p/govn">http://zelea.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Ed-EdpastoreCom/G/p/govn</A>

So currently you have an active proposal, but you are supporting my nonexistent proposal. Why? Why not ask me to vote for you instead of just going ahead and voting for me when I'm not yet even involved in the process? Are you (procedurally) telling me that you want me to come up with a better proposal than yours and that you are suggesting that I start by editing yours?

If that's the case, then I should go to your proposal (first link above) and click on the small &quot;my&quot; link near the upper-left side of the page, which then prompts me with instructions on how to create my own draft:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/MyDraft?p=G!p!govn&amp;pin=Mike-ZeleaCom">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/MyDraft?p=G!p!govn&amp;pin=Mike-ZeleaCom</A>
because I do not yet have a draft to compare to yours yet.

Am I getting this right, and again, why the (apparent) reverse-voting?

</I>&gt;<i> This is a small-group governance issue.  It's similar to the one we
</I>&gt;<i> worked on for Metagov last year.  One difference is the context, of
</I>&gt;<i> course.  This is done in Occupy, where the OVN is just one working
</I>&gt;<i> group among many.  So if the practice catches on, then we can
</I>&gt;<i> immediately expand it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another difference is the clean separation of primary and ratification
</I>&gt;<i> processes.  Actual ratification is beyond the scope of the mirroring
</I>&gt;<i> network (OVN).  It belongs to the governance mechanism itself, which
</I>&gt;<i> is more in the baliwick of other projects in Occupy (like the FGA).
</I>&gt;<i> So this is another opportunity for cross-project cooperation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I nominated you as candidate.  I think you're ideal in that role:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!govn">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!govn</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... Where would I start, and what particular activities would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most helpful at the outset? (I ask also in the hopes that others may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contribute as well.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We would do the same kind of thing we did with the Metagov rules.
</I>&gt;<i> We'd try and reach agreement.  So we'd mostly draft, paste diff URLs,
</I>&gt;<i> and talk.  We'd critique the software too, because half the job is to
</I>&gt;<i> pinpoint usability problems and fix them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are several forums we could use, but maybe one of these is best:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/ovn/forum">http://www.nycga.net/groups/ovn/forum</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.takethesquare.net/mailman/pipermail/lists.takethesquare.net/occupy-dev/">https://lists.takethesquare.net/mailman/pipermail/lists.takethesquare.net/occupy-dev/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's an experiment and I don't know where it'll go.  But I'm pretty
</I>&gt;<i> sure the design we're developing (both tools and practices) can scale
</I>&gt;<i> to the level of Congress.  We couldn't have an impact on the 2012 US
</I>&gt;<i> elections (too little time).  But we could easily make the news in the
</I>&gt;<i> runup.  Primaries are crucial, of course, and the OVN can do both
</I>&gt;<i> electoral and legislative primaries in ways that cut across all
</I>&gt;<i> political parties. *
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. When I go to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/_/javadoc/index.html?votorola/a/poll/CountWAP.html">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/_/javadoc/index.html?votorola/a/poll/CountWAP.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the right frame loads, but then is replaced with a &quot;Not Found&quot; page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you, the link should have been:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Including the E2D ones.  But I think there's an interesting role
</I>&gt;<i>   for a kind of E2D &quot;un-party&quot; to house the primary voting network,
</I>&gt;<i>   especially in places that have proportional legislatures.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes. Every part of Votorola (Outcast Ui, drafting media, difference bridge, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote counting, voter registry) can be ripped apart and reassembled to any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs. Even the vote counting algorithm can be customized with Accounts inside 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the current default architecture (1). This means any process that can be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expressed in delegate terms is implementable in its framework (including no 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delegation as a trivial case). Also the difference bridge is not elementary to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the technical process (we think it is communicatively), so you can leave it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out or offer a better way of people to compare and synchronize their drafts 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (including copy and paste/none). It also is an interesting problem in itself 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to compare documents meaningfully.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can also leave out drafting and just use voting for predefined positions 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (a bit like liquidfeedback, imagine a CMS like drupal predetermining the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drafts by an organisation). All you need to do is to make the Wiki read-only 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and implement the necessary draft parsing for your CMS.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just wanted to point that out, because (new/outside) people lately tend to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think that OVN is only a concept and we have little to offer as implementation 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on metagovernment/votorola questions. We endorse any reuse (including 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commercial) of our software and we don't see it as our baby, but as a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collective asset. This might help a bit to separate us from the buzz.
