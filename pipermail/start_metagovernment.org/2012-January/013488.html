<PRE>Hi Ed,

I apologize, because I asked for more than you offered.  You turn my
request into a lesson on how the technology works, so I answer:

Ed Pastore wrote:
&gt;<i> OK, let me walk through a bit of my experience and ask some
</I>&gt;<i> questions...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You have made a proposal:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/govn">http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/govn</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, you are voting for me, as indicated by this vote page which
</I>&gt;<i> is associated with the above because it ends in G!p!govn (right?):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!govn">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!govn</A>
</I>
Technically, yes.  But the title &quot;Promulgation of governing norms for
the Open Voting Network&quot; should be a better indication.

&gt;<i> From that page, since the focus is on me (as indicated by the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&quot; in the URL) ...
</I>
Also because Ed-EdpastoreCom is highlighted in blue, which is your
name in &quot;Mailish&quot;.

&gt;<i> ... then if I click on the page-like icon (leftmost of the three at
</I>&gt;<i> the top-right of the page), I am taken to the (non-existant) draft
</I>&gt;<i> that belongs to me:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Ed-EdpastoreCom/G/p/govn">http://zelea.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Ed-EdpastoreCom/G/p/govn</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So currently you have an active proposal, but you are supporting my
</I>&gt;<i> nonexistent proposal. Why?  Why not ask me to vote for you instead of
</I>&gt;<i> just going ahead and voting for me when I'm not yet even involved in
</I>&gt;<i> the process?  Are you (procedurally) telling me that you want me to
</I>&gt;<i> come up with a better proposal than yours and that you are
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting that I start by editing yours?
</I>
Not really - not that kind of challenge.  I'm using my vote to
nominate you as a candidate.  I believe the role of candidate is to
help the voters reach consensus, and I think you're ideal for that
role.  (other reasons below)

&gt;<i> If that's the case, then I should go to your proposal (first link
</I>&gt;<i> above) and click on the small &quot;my&quot; link near the upper-left side of
</I>&gt;<i> the page, which then prompts me with instructions on how to create
</I>&gt;<i> my own draft:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/MyDraft?p=G!p!govn&amp;pin=Mike-ZeleaCom">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/MyDraft?p=G!p!govn&amp;pin=Mike-ZeleaCom</A>
</I>&gt;<i> because I do not yet have a draft to compare to yours yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am I getting this right, and again, why the (apparent)
</I>&gt;<i> reverse-voting?
</I>
Yes, that's maybe the simplest way to get started.

There are two other reasons why I decided to nominate you, aside from
your suitability: (1) To save you time.  The candidate's role needn't
always be active.  Often the voters can talk amongst themselves and
reach consensus without anyone's help.  In that case, the candidate
need only register the final fact of consensus by patching it into his
own draft of the text.

(2) I think it would help the OVN gain traction if someone other than
me took a prominent and responsible role.

It's interesting how this relates to the organizational structure
being debated for Metagov.  Although it's OK to enforce a single
voting method for the ratification of group decisions, it's *not* OK
to enforce a single method for the primary consensus making that leads
up to ratification.  For that, I think we need something like Outcast
that's open to any number of voting methods.  (I guess the OVN is just
the group that says so, and tries to make it happen.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks Ed and C,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... I'll see if I can commit to participation. Even I find the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; barrier to entry pretty high with Votorola at the moment...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So do I.  It's frustrating at times.  But if non-tech folks can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shoulder some of the burden, then I think engineers will come and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... But if you can start me in the right direction, I will try to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; some work on it at some point this week. ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I drafted a proposal: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/govn">http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/govn</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a small-group governance issue.  It's similar to the one we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worked on for Metagov last year.  One difference is the context, of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course.  This is done in Occupy, where the OVN is just one working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; group among many.  So if the practice catches on, then we can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; immediately expand it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another difference is the clean separation of primary and ratification
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; processes.  Actual ratification is beyond the scope of the mirroring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; network (OVN).  It belongs to the governance mechanism itself, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is more in the baliwick of other projects in Occupy (like the FGA).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So this is another opportunity for cross-project cooperation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I nominated you as candidate.  I think you're ideal in that role:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!govn">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!govn</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... Where would I start, and what particular activities would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; most helpful at the outset? (I ask also in the hopes that others may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; contribute as well.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We would do the same kind of thing we did with the Metagov rules.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We'd try and reach agreement.  So we'd mostly draft, paste diff URLs,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and talk.  We'd critique the software too, because half the job is to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pinpoint usability problems and fix them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are several forums we could use, but maybe one of these is best:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/ovn/forum">http://www.nycga.net/groups/ovn/forum</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://lists.takethesquare.net/mailman/pipermail/lists.takethesquare.net/occupy-dev/">https://lists.takethesquare.net/mailman/pipermail/lists.takethesquare.net/occupy-dev/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's an experiment and I don't know where it'll go.  But I'm pretty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sure the design we're developing (both tools and practices) can scale
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the level of Congress.  We couldn't have an impact on the 2012 US
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; elections (too little time).  But we could easily make the news in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runup.  Primaries are crucial, of course, and the OVN can do both
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; electoral and legislative primaries in ways that cut across all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political parties. *
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; P.S. When I go to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/_/javadoc/index.html?votorola/a/poll/CountWAP.html">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/_/javadoc/index.html?votorola/a/poll/CountWAP.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the right frame loads, but then is replaced with a &quot;Not Found&quot; page.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you, the link should have been:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/_/javadoc/index.html?votorola/a/count/CountWAP.html">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/_/javadoc/index.html?votorola/a/count/CountWAP.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I corrected it here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Including the E2D ones.  But I think there's an interesting role
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   for a kind of E2D &quot;un-party&quot; to house the primary voting network,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   especially in places that have proportional legislatures.
