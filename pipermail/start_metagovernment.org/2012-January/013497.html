<PRE>Michael,
My quick response to your first paragraph would be....let's not abandon the nycga forums until the WG is imminently sure to be shut down.
There seems to be some possibility of acquittal and, in my mind, it might be good to gather as much ground there as we can...before we abandon ship entirely.
Maybe we could, as was suggested, petition the GA to let us stay. I don't want to get pushy...and yet I don't want to lose the WG as a venue for the development and implementation of the OVN in Occupy. Or perhaps we could petition another WG to post our forum(s) for us.
(I'd intend to respond to the rest of your email later....:-)
Steve

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, or soley for the particular working group that's responsible for

</I>&gt;<i>  outcasts
</I>&gt;<i>      Members of the working group, or the working group as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &quot;We are the outcasts.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Outcast (or the Network)
</I>&gt;<i>      The architecture (broad design) that is common to all networks:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &quot;Outcast is the world's most comprehensive design for
</I>&gt;<i>      e-democracy.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  network
</I>&gt;<i>      A particular cluster of cross-mirroring vote-servers that are
</I>&gt;<i>      centered on a single pollwiki.  Most commonly this would be a
</I>&gt;<i>      local network, e.g. dedicated to a particular city.  But it
</I>&gt;<i>      might also be federal, organizational or global:
</I>&gt;<i>      <A HREF="http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture">http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &quot;Why does Berlin have 12 vote-servers in their network, and
</I>&gt;<i>      Kalamazoo only has 2?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And the purpose of this working group (other than to practice using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the tools) is to develop, oversee, and/or advance the Network
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or... what? I&#8217;m not sure I understand the difference between the OVN
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the OVN working group.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The purpose of the working group (at least as I foresaw it) is defined
</I>&gt;<i> on our home page: <A HREF="http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network">http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Our aim is to ensure that: (A) no willing participant is excluded
</I>&gt;<i>  from the development of the technologies and practices of primary
</I>&gt;<i>  voting and consensus making within Occupy; (B) no alternative
</I>&gt;<i>  toolset, platform or practice is excluded from the overall
</I>&gt;<i>  development effort; and (C) each user may freely choose a provider,
</I>&gt;<i>  toolset and practices based on personal needs and preferences
</I>&gt;<i>  without thereby becoming isolated from other users who make
</I>&gt;<i>  different choices.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But this is open to discussion: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/G/p/hovn">http://zelea.com/w/G/p/hovn</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All of this *is* rather confusing, I agree.  It's a big design.
</I>&gt;<i> There's no easy way to understand *any* comprehensive system of
</I>&gt;<i> democracy - even looking across our own borders, the differences in
</I>&gt;<i> traditional systems can be very confusing - never mind something
</I>&gt;<i> that's radically different.  On top of it, there's all the
</I>&gt;<i> organizational and political stuff (working group, Occupy, relations
</I>&gt;<i> with existing political systems) which only adds to the complexity.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So again, this concerns voting on the working group's own issues (what
</I>&gt;<i> should our home page say?  who should be treasurer?).  The suggestion
</I>&gt;<i> is that anyone's vote counts, provided it was cast within our
</I>&gt;<i> mirroring network.  Right?  What do others think?
