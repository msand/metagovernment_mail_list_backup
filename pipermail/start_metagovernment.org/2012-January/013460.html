<PRE>Thanks Per and Bruce. Responses to both of you are below.

</I>
At least here in Virginia, it is too late to run under a party. The party has to have been officially established for longer than is possible in the current window. A party could still be formed and affiliated with, but it would not appear on the ballot. (And generally, most states have very harsh party-related requirements, because the rules are determined by the two main parties and they have devised the rules to deliberately suppress other parties from being able to fairly compete.) 

For the US Congress, I would need a thousand signatures from my district by June. That's a Virginia rule; it's different elsewhere. I could run for a local office, but again Virginia is odd that way: we are not in line with the federal calendar, so I believe there are no local 2012 elections.

&gt;<i> Hi Ed!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Bruce. I cannot answer for the entire E2D, but this is my attempt to convince you. Hopefully the others can help me to persuade you!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If I should win, what software can I use?
</I>&gt;<i> There is no international standard yet, but there are several programs that ought to suit well. Demoex's current software is very reliable, but we have to clear away some spam manually and the visual interface is out of date. We are developing a new software this year (open source) that will be much better than the present.
</I>
Then if I were to take office in January of 2013, you think it would be ready by then?

Also, I invite you to talk about the software on the Metagov list.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup</A>
Our community may be able to provide valuable feedback. And we'd love to have you at least lurking there, since Demoex is by far the most advanced of any group in terms of real-world success.

&gt;<i> 2. Are decisions made by simple majority?
</I>&gt;<i> If you get more than one mandatory I suggest that you apply statistical representation. Let the representatives vote to represent the Internet voting statistically, i.e. according to D'Hondt method. If you have ten seats the half of them can vore for and the other half can vote against a proposal. This means that the entire majority-ruled system turns dynamic if you become master of the scale between the big parties.
</I>
It's different here in the US: people vote for individuals, not parties. That means, I would be running as myself. As I noted to Bruce, I can affiliate with a party (though it wouldn't even appear on the ballot), but if I win, I would be solely responsible for representing my entire district to the House of Representatives. I suspect majority rule is the only thing possible here, though I do not like it at all.

&gt;<i> 3. Do E2D parties normally restrict participation in decision-making to people within the representative's district?
</I>&gt;<i> In Demoex, yes. Our principle is that citizens are allowed to e-vote in the same district as they vote in by the General Election. I think this principle is widely accepted by most of the citizens, so hopefully you don&#180;t need to argue very much. If you use statistical representation which I mentioned in the last issue a further division into districts is not necessary, because every ballot affect the seats.
</I>
How do you know if someone is local to the district? Do they have to register in the software and then be manually validated somehow?

(Just as an aside, in collaborative governance, most of us do not want to have locality-based voting. If someone has an interest in a decision, then they should be allowed to vote on it, regardless of where they happen to live. But of course I understand how it is different with E2D, since it is an adaptation to the existing system instead of a new one.)
