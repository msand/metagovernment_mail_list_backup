<PRE>Hi Ed,

&gt;<i> ... Is there anything that people in this group can do right now to
</I>&gt;<i> help?
</I>
Our most urgent need is for someone who is both familiar with Votorola
and adept at online discussion, such as you or Thomas (C is too busy
at school).  The task is to use the software within the OVN forum, so
others can see it in action.  (Not many people are comfortable being
the first on the dance floor.)  The commitment is about an hour a day
for a week (though longer if you can spare the time).

&gt;<i> Concerning Caveat (a.i) on that page, I believe you could set up a
</I>&gt;<i> subdomain on the Tuxfamily site; at least to get it up and running.
</I>
Thank you.  If the working group can survive in the NYCGA this month
(tough because the rules have just changed) then we'll be eligible for
professional hosting and use of the &quot;official&quot; domain names, like
occupy.net.  Otherwise we'll be looking for a home somewhere else
within the movement, and the question of hosting may resurface.

&gt;<i> Is this OVN an implementation of Outcast?
</I>
Yes, but excluding the difference bridge and the stuff to its right:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A>

Currently only Votorola can do free-range drafting and cross-forum
ranging, so it's not really common ground (not yet).  But the rest is
on offer to Occupy under the name &quot;OVN&quot;.  The name &quot;Outcast&quot; isn't
being used.
