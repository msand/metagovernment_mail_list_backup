<PRE>Thanks Ed and C,

&gt;<i> ... I'll see if I can commit to participation. Even I find the
</I>&gt;<i> barrier to entry pretty high with Votorola at the moment...
</I>
So do I.  It's frustrating at times.  But if non-tech folks can
shoulder some of the burden, then I think engineers will come and
help.

&gt;<i> ... But if you can start me in the right direction, I will try to do
</I>&gt;<i> some work on it at some point this week. ...
</I>
I drafted a proposal: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/govn">http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/govn</A>
This is a small-group governance issue.  It's similar to the one we
worked on for Metagov last year.  One difference is the context, of
course.  This is done in Occupy, where the OVN is just one working
group among many.  So if the practice catches on, then we can
immediately expand it.

Another difference is the clean separation of primary and ratification
processes.  Actual ratification is beyond the scope of the mirroring
network (OVN).  It belongs to the governance mechanism itself, which
is more in the baliwick of other projects in Occupy (like the FGA).
So this is another opportunity for cross-project cooperation.

I nominated you as candidate.  I think you're ideal in that role:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!govn">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!govn</A>

&gt;<i> ... Where would I start, and what particular activities would be
</I>&gt;<i> most helpful at the outset? (I ask also in the hopes that others may
</I>&gt;<i> contribute as well.)
</I>
We would do the same kind of thing we did with the Metagov rules.
We'd try and reach agreement.  So we'd mostly draft, paste diff URLs,
and talk.  We'd critique the software too, because half the job is to
pinpoint usability problems and fix them.

There are several forums we could use, but maybe one of these is best:
<A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/ovn/forum">http://www.nycga.net/groups/ovn/forum</A>
<A HREF="https://lists.takethesquare.net/mailman/pipermail/lists.takethesquare.net/occupy-dev/">https://lists.takethesquare.net/mailman/pipermail/lists.takethesquare.net/occupy-dev/</A>
 
It's an experiment and I don't know where it'll go.  But I'm pretty
sure the design we're developing (both tools and practices) can scale
to the level of Congress.  We couldn't have an impact on the 2012 US
elections (too little time).  But we could easily make the news in the
runup.  Primaries are crucial, of course, and the OVN can do both
electoral and legislative primaries in ways that cut across all
political parties. *

&gt;<i> P.S. When I go to
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/_/javadoc/index.html?votorola/a/poll/CountWAP.html">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/_/javadoc/index.html?votorola/a/poll/CountWAP.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> the right frame loads, but then is replaced with a &quot;Not Found&quot; page.
</I>
Thank you, the link should have been:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/_/javadoc/index.html?votorola/a/count/CountWAP.html">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/_/javadoc/index.html?votorola/a/count/CountWAP.html</A>
I corrected it here:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A>

 * Including the E2D ones.  But I think there's an interesting role
   for a kind of E2D &quot;un-party&quot; to house the primary voting network,
   especially in places that have proportional legislatures.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... Is there anything that people in this group can do right now to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; help?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our most urgent need is for someone who is both familiar with Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and adept at online discussion, such as you or Thomas (C is too busy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at school).  The task is to use the software within the OVN forum, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; others can see it in action.  (Not many people are comfortable being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the first on the dance floor.)  The commitment is about an hour a day
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a week (though longer if you can spare the time).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Concerning Caveat (a.i) on that page, I believe you could set up a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; subdomain on the Tuxfamily site; at least to get it up and running.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you.  If the working group can survive in the NYCGA this month
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (tough because the rules have just changed) then we'll be eligible for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; professional hosting and use of the &quot;official&quot; domain names, like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; occupy.net.  Otherwise we'll be looking for a home somewhere else
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within the movement, and the question of hosting may resurface.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Is this OVN an implementation of Outcast?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, but excluding the difference bridge and the stuff to its right:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently only Votorola can do free-range drafting and cross-forum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ranging, so it's not really common ground (not yet).  But the rest is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on offer to Occupy under the name &quot;OVN&quot;.  The name &quot;Outcast&quot; isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being used.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Every part of Votorola (Outcast Ui, drafting media, difference bridge, 
</I>&gt;<i> vote counting, voter registry) can be ripped apart and reassembled to any 
</I>&gt;<i> needs. Even the vote counting algorithm can be customized with Accounts inside 
</I>&gt;<i> the current default architecture (1). This means any process that can be 
</I>&gt;<i> expressed in delegate terms is implementable in its framework (including no 
</I>&gt;<i> delegation as a trivial case). Also the difference bridge is not elementary to 
</I>&gt;<i> the technical process (we think it is communicatively), so you can leave it 
</I>&gt;<i> out or offer a better way of people to compare and synchronize their drafts 
</I>&gt;<i> (including copy and paste/none). It also is an interesting problem in itself 
</I>&gt;<i> to compare documents meaningfully.
</I>&gt;<i> You can also leave out drafting and just use voting for predefined positions 
</I>&gt;<i> (a bit like liquidfeedback, imagine a CMS like drupal predetermining the 
</I>&gt;<i> drafts by an organisation). All you need to do is to make the Wiki read-only 
</I>&gt;<i> and implement the necessary draft parsing for your CMS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just wanted to point that out, because (new/outside) people lately tend to 
</I>&gt;<i> think that OVN is only a concept and we have little to offer as implementation 
</I>&gt;<i> on metagovernment/votorola questions. We endorse any reuse (including 
</I>&gt;<i> commercial) of our software and we don't see it as our baby, but as a 
</I>&gt;<i> collective asset. This might help a bit to separate us from the buzz.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Michael, I'll see if I can commit to participation. Even I find the barrier

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as well.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ed, I am interested in going to the occupy forum and help, but I am busy with 
</I>&gt;<i> university. I am involved in Occupy Germany a bit and I do care about occupy's 
</I>&gt;<i> success. I would do it with you together though, are you interested? Maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas comes back and can also help, but as I am a bit familiar with the 
</I>&gt;<i> technical bits, I might complement you well. My skype name is oml1123
