<PRE>Hi Ed,



I only can give my personal view of course.



I answer in between

Subject: [MG] Convince me to run for office



&gt;<i> Hi, folks!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My name is Ed Pastore. I am associated with the Metagovernment project, 
</I>&gt;<i> which as some of you know, is an end-goal-oriented project to build a new 
</I>&gt;<i> form of governance which completely removes the system of representation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of you describe E2D as a big step in our direction, which I may or 
</I>&gt;<i> may not agree with.
</I>


Hi Ed,



Well, we have to distinguish short term goals and long term goals. Here in 
Belgium (some 10 million people) we are looking at the E2D system (or 
Demoex) as a short term goal in order to proceed to the long term goal, the 
Swiss model. Switzerland can be compared very good with Belgium, it has more 
or less the same number of citizens, it has four recognised languages (three 
in Belgium), it has no or few natural recourses etc...  But Switzerland is 
still much smaller then for instance California and characterized by a 
strong communal independence with a free federation in cantons and the Swiss 
federation.



&gt;<i> I am still unclear on how E2D can be done in a way that does more harm 
</I>&gt;<i> than good.
</I>


We can't see the harm in it, it is only a first small step towards direct 
democracy in a representative system that does not allow direct democracy 
and is fighting it with all means.



&gt;<i>So I am presenting you with a challenge: convince me that E2D can be done 
</I>&gt;<i>well (not perfectly, I understand that, but well), and I will consider 
</I>&gt;<i>running for office here in the United States, perhaps even for the national 
</I>&gt;<i>house of Representatives.
</I>


We propose to start on communal level and build up from there. But there may 
be a publicity aspect on participating on federal level (like the 
Australians from SOL for example)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to convince me (should you wish to do so), you need to help me 
</I>&gt;<i> answer these questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If I should win, what software can I use? The software systems being 
</I>&gt;<i> developed in Metagovernment are all in Alpha at best, but obviously Demoex 
</I>&gt;<i> is using something. Is that good enough to handle a U.S. Federal district?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>


there will be a continuous development and software and hardware systems 
will be better every year. Demoex started in 2002 !! The German pirates are 
using <A HREF="http://www.public-software-group.org/liquid_feedback">http://www.public-software-group.org/liquid_feedback</A> ,UCL and Harvard 
developed Helios <A HREF="http://heliosvoting.org/">http://heliosvoting.org/</A> . for auditable voting in an 
internet environment, we in Belgium have an eID (electronic Identity card 
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/eid-mw/">http://code.google.com/p/eid-mw/</A> ) and a we developed and tested a voting 
system with it.


&gt;<i> 2. Are decisions made by simple majority? The Metagovernment project has a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot of problems with the idea of majority rule, but I don't see how E2D 
</I>&gt;<i> can do anything better when trying to integrate into an existing 
</I>&gt;<i> majority-rule system.
</I>
Democracy, and also direct Democracy is not about a voting system. It is 
primarily a case of ethics and morality. And there will be always a 
difference between peoples convincions, one can be more social or individual 
or religious and so on.



*1. For libertarians a democracy is not acceptable

*2. For constitutionalists there has to be a ruling class (constitution and 
constitutional judges, social contract and judges, natural law and ..?, 
divine law and High Priests, in short, an oligarchy like the elected 
politicians. Who pays the judges, who appoints them,..)

*3. Populists who are in favour of direct democracy without exception.

and all systems who are a mixture of them all.



Question is to find a way to live together with an &quot;acceptable&quot; system.

But for me the key question is how people are able to change their system. 
In Belgium (representative democracy) we are not. Only politicians can.



As an example we can look at the Swiss system (referendum and initiative 
system).

They have a very strong Communal sovereignty.

The community even can change from canton if the citizens decide to do that. 
They divided a canton in two by referendum (Bern and Jura) and they could 
choose for their community to which canton they wanted to belong. Taxes are 
most levied on communal level and then transferred to the cantonal and 
federal level. There is a financial solidarity system between rich and poor 
cantons but it is very straight forward and clear to every citizen (an excel 
sheet)



We can try do decide in what direction we, as a community, want to evolve

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient</A>
like software there is no ideal statistic but together they may give an 
idea.



If we look at the Swiss system, the communal sovereignty gives a lot of 
individual freedom (*1), there is a constitution (*2), but it can be changed 
by a peoples referendum (*3) with a double majority (majority of citizens + 
majority of cantons). It looks like a good mixture and above all things, the 
Swiss likes it. For the moment tehre is a movement for a major change: there 
are political parties (and yes, there is a representative system also for 
the day to day governing) and for the moment donations to political parties 
are secret. This is a major discussion that may end in a referendum.



I think that most people are not interested in the theorethical discussion 
about &quot;democracy&quot; but when given the possibility to decide on a subject they 
are intersted (a bridge or tunnel, traffic on the market place or not, 
communal budget, and so on)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Do E2D parties normally restrict participation in decision-making to 
</I>&gt;<i> people within the representative's district? If so, then how can I enforce 
</I>&gt;<i> that requirement?
</I>


I think so.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. How do E2D representatives deal with new business? That is, if 
</I>&gt;<i> something comes to a vote and the rep has not yet had time to present it 
</I>&gt;<i> to the public, then how does the rep vote?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>


abstain


&gt;<i> Thanks for your help,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>


Paul



and a happy new year

 (I asked the owner of the group to delete metagovernment group as a member 
of the e2d mailing group, I don't know when he does it so I send my response 
to both groups. Sorry for the inconvenience in case of multiple mailing)
