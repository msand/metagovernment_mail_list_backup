<PRE>*Hi Ed!*

I agree with Bruce. I cannot answer for the entire E2D, but this is my
attempt to convince you. Hopefully the others can help me to persuade you!

*1. If I should win, what software can I use?*
There is no international standard yet, but there are several programs that
ought to suit well. Demoex's current software is very reliable, but we have
to clear away some spam manually and the visual interface is out of date.
We are developing a new software this year (open source) that will be much
better than the present.

*2. Are decisions made by simple majority?*
If you get more than one mandatory I suggest that you apply statistical
representation. Let the representatives vote to represent the Internet
voting statistically, i.e. according to D'Hondt
method&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D</A>'Hondt_method&gt;.
If you have ten seats the half of them can vore for and the other half can
vote against a proposal. This means that the entire majority-ruled system
turns dynamic if you become master of the scale between the big parties.

*3. Do E2D parties normally restrict participation in decision-making to
people within the representative's district?*
In Demoex, yes. Our principle is that citizens are allowed to e-vote in the
same district as they vote in by the General Election. I think this
principle is widely accepted by most of the citizens, so hopefully you
don&#180;t need to argue very much. If you use statistical representation which
I mentioned in the last issue a further division into districts is not
necessary, because every ballot affect the seats.

*4. How do E2D representatives deal with new business?*
There must be a little space for the representatives to interpret the
participants&#180;will. Demoex let them decide when to abstain, request
recommittment or to support a proposal with a minor supplement that is
still very close to the proposal people did vote for. Right now Demoex have
voting deadline six hours before the meeting starts, but it's getting
closer! In a few years we will have live broadcasts from the parliament
with related discussions online so it will be possible for net users to
affect the representatives and change their voting almost in real time.

Good luck!

&gt;<i> Hi, folks!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My name is Ed Pastore. I am associated with the Metagovernment project,
</I>&gt;<i> which as some of you know, is an end-goal-oriented project to build a new
</I>&gt;<i> form of governance which completely removes the system of representation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of you describe E2D as a big step in our direction, which I may or
</I>&gt;<i> may not agree with. I am still unclear on how E2D can be done in a way that
</I>&gt;<i> does more harm than good. So I am presenting you with a challenge: convince
</I>&gt;<i> me that E2D can be done well (not perfectly, I understand that, but well),
</I>&gt;<i> and I will consider running for office here in the United States, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> even for the national house of Representatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to convince me (should you wish to do so), you need to help me
</I>&gt;<i> answer these questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The software systems being developed in Metagovernment are all in Alpha
</I>&gt;<i> at best, but obviously Demoex is using something. Is that good enough to
</I>&gt;<i> handle a U.S. Federal district?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Are decisions made by simple majority? The Metagovernment project has a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of problems with the idea of majority rule, but I don't see how E2D can
</I>&gt;<i> do anything better when trying to integrate into an existing majority-rule
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Do E2D parties normally restrict participation in decision-making to
</I>&gt;<i> people within the representative's district? If so, then how can I enforce
</I>&gt;<i> that requirement?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. How do E2D representatives deal with new business? That is, if
</I>&gt;<i> something comes to a vote and the rep has not yet had time to present it to
</I>&gt;<i> the public, then how does the rep vote?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ed Pastore
