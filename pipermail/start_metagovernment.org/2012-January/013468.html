<PRE>Hi Mike and Ed,

&gt;<i> I'd like to emphasize Michael's last point below: while his work is adapted
</I>&gt;<i> to Votorola in the short-term, it is being developed fundamentally as an
</I>&gt;<i> open network that can use many different voting systems. Anyone working on
</I>&gt;<i> a different project can still contribute to OVN without &quot;hurting&quot; their own
</I>&gt;<i> project.
</I>
Yes. Every part of Votorola (Outcast Ui, drafting media, difference bridge, 
vote counting, voter registry) can be ripped apart and reassembled to any 
needs. Even the vote counting algorithm can be customized with Accounts inside 
the current default architecture (1). This means any process that can be 
expressed in delegate terms is implementable in its framework (including no 
delegation as a trivial case). Also the difference bridge is not elementary to 
the technical process (we think it is communicatively), so you can leave it 
out or offer a better way of people to compare and synchronize their drafts 
(including copy and paste/none). It also is an interesting problem in itself 
to compare documents meaningfully.
You can also leave out drafting and just use voting for predefined positions 
(a bit like liquidfeedback, imagine a CMS like drupal predetermining the 
drafts by an organisation). All you need to do is to make the Wiki read-only 
and implement the necessary draft parsing for your CMS.

Just wanted to point that out, because (new/outside) people lately tend to 
think that OVN is only a concept and we have little to offer as implementation 
on metagovernment/votorola questions. We endorse any reuse (including 
commercial) of our software and we don't see it as our baby, but as a 
collective asset. This might help a bit to separate us from the buzz.
 
&gt;<i> Michael, I'll see if I can commit to participation. Even I find the barrier
</I>&gt;<i> to entry pretty high with Votorola at the moment. But if you can start me
</I>&gt;<i> in the right direction, I will try to do some work on it at some point this
</I>&gt;<i> week. Where would I start, and what particular activities would be most
</I>&gt;<i> helpful at the outset? (I ask also in the hopes that others may contribute
</I>&gt;<i> as well.)
</I>
Ed, I am interested in going to the occupy forum and help, but I am busy with 
university. I am involved in Occupy Germany a bit and I do care about occupy's 
success. I would do it with you together though, are you interested? Maybe 
Thomas comes back and can also help, but as I am a bit familiar with the 
technical bits, I might complement you well. My skype name is oml1123
