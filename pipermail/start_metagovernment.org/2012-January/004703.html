<PRE>Hi Pietro,

I'm back from holidays.

Looking back at our conversation, I think, I can see the misunderstanding.

You look at delegated voting as a voting method among others like 
Condercet etc. Their purpose is to filter out the best position from a 
lot of different and fixed (not changing) positions. For that purpose 
delegated voting is probably not the best ... this is your point and I 
agree with you!

In Votorola though, delegated voting is used for a different purpose: 
the positions are not fixed, they can change all the time. Peaces of 
text, i.e. new ideas, new creative solutions etc. can flow up and down 
the delegation tree. Positions can merge and split up etc. Because of 
this the whole system allows its users over time to slowly move towards 
a consensus-position. In that case it becomes obvious: if you have only 
one position and 100% of the votes for it, you don't need a 
sophisticated voting method anymore. (This is ofc an ideal case, but the 
same is true imo for cases like 90% vs. 10% ...)

Best,
Thomas

&gt;<i> First of all, thanks Thomas for clarifying that in Votorola delegation
</I>&gt;<i> is done only inside a single poll. That sounds better, although still
</I>&gt;<i> unsafe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the rest...
</I>&gt;<i> the idea that rusting should change depending on the changes done seem
</I>&gt;<i> to me based on an unsolved (and maybe unsolvable) problem if you do it
</I>&gt;<i> from a semantic point of view. Seems to me unreasonable if done on a
</I>&gt;<i> non semantically base (hamiltonian distance).
</I>&gt;<i> But also the idea that the person that suggests a new idea should
</I>&gt;<i> declare how much does it differ from the original proposal seem to me
</I>&gt;<i> like a non-practical solution. People in Italy tend to pretend that
</I>&gt;<i> the little loophole they introduced in the law is &quot;nothing important&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> while they add that money sent for alternative energies can now be
</I>&gt;<i> used for nuclear power. And that genetically modified food can be
</I>&gt;<i> labelled as organic. First you make a law have enough support to make
</I>&gt;<i> it pass, then you add the little comma you are really interested in.
</I>&gt;<i> You simply cannot trust the person making the change to tell you how
</I>&gt;<i> big the change was.
</I>&gt;<i> Asking other people to check for each change, and make sure it is well
</I>&gt;<i> done will work for big, popular topics, but not for the myriad of
</I>&gt;<i> unpopular ones. Like in Wikipedia popular pages are more precise than
</I>&gt;<i> paged edited by few pens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All together it seem to me that a rusting that differentiate from
</I>&gt;<i> change to change does not work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But on the base of all this, I have to admit I cannot find the moral,
</I>&gt;<i> ethical or pragmatic reason why we need to let people delegate their
</I>&gt;<i> power at all. In any shape manner or form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was a time when most of the people where ignorant. So they were
</I>&gt;<i> believed to just have the power to vote who among the educated should
</I>&gt;<i> guide them. It was impractical to have everybody voting, and
</I>&gt;<i> impossible for the people to know what they needed to make educated
</I>&gt;<i> decisions. Also those people had the bad habit of starting
</I>&gt;<i> revolutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now everybody knows how to read and write. Although many people
</I>&gt;<i> believe that the sun rotates around the earth everybody is able to
</I>&gt;<i> look inside the internet to find the answers they need. The situation
</I>&gt;<i> is totally different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also forcing people to delegate their power is leading people not to
</I>&gt;<i> think, while people who are called to make decisions tend to take it
</I>&gt;<i> seriously, and educate themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also have some field testing of representative democratic system,
</I>&gt;<i> and in all of them (in some cases more, in some less) representation
</I>&gt;<i> leads to corruption. Leads to people trying to convince the bottleneck
</I>&gt;<i> of the decision process: giving money to the representatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You make a representative system you are practically bound to generate
</I>&gt;<i> corruption. People giving off their vote for money. People betraying
</I>&gt;<i> the trust of other people for more money. Are we trying to make a
</I>&gt;<i> democratic system or restarting the economy? ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea of proxy voting was a nice intuition. But not all intuitions
</I>&gt;<i> are bound to be true (in science) or acceptable (in design) once you
</I>&gt;<i> think them through in the details. This is the case in every form of
</I>&gt;<i> research and e-Democracy is no different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the problem we are trying to solve with proxy voting? (real
</I>&gt;<i> question, not a rhetoric one)
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there are different ways to solve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For me I would support a system where people need to vote directly. No
</I>&gt;<i> one can give to anyone else their power. It is not possible to give to
</I>&gt;<i> anyone the URL to someone else to vote for it. The system avoids older
</I>&gt;<i> proposal from having any advantage over new ones. People can describe
</I>&gt;<i> a general idea (vote for a proposal where it is said...), but then
</I>&gt;<i> people need to actually understand the proposals to make sure they are
</I>&gt;<i> voting for the right thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A side effect of this might be that laws become suddenly simpler to
</I>&gt;<i> understand. Call it a feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The result of this is that not everybody can vote? This is not a
</I>&gt;<i> problem as long as anyone who wants to vote can vote, and anyone can
</I>&gt;<i> educate himself to understand what he is voting. I also would support
</I>&gt;<i> a system where proposals are automatically clustered, and people can
</I>&gt;<i> support all the proposals in a cluster. Also although not everybody
</I>&gt;<i> can vote, nearly everybody will probably vote for the issues they
</I>&gt;<i> really care about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also right now we are lead to believe that politicians are so
</I>&gt;<i> knowledgeable. Many forms of candid camera were taken in Italy showing
</I>&gt;<i> how italian politicians are generally quite ignorant. Pretty much like
</I>&gt;<i> the average Joe. And when a non political person, who passed his life
</I>&gt;<i> in studying a topic, a technician, is placed in a place of power
</I>&gt;<i> everybody protests.
