<PRE>Hi Steve,

&gt;<i> I think it's not knowing the groups *realm of influence* that's
</I>&gt;<i> confusing me...
</I>
I may have mis-interpreted your original question.  By &quot;these rules&quot;,
I assumed you meant only the promulgation rules:

&gt;<i> ... I've been imagining this working group is developing rules for
</I>&gt;<i> the Network... when actually these rules are solely for &quot;a working
</I>&gt;<i> group&quot; within the Network?
</I>
      Subject             Form    Action          Object
      ------------------  ------  --------------  -------------
 (a)  Hammer              Tool    Pounding        Nails
                                                  
 (b)  Promulgation rules  Rule    Passing and     Rules, plans,
                                  enforcing       policies, etc
                                               
 (c)  Network operation   Rule    Administration  Networks
      rules
                                                  
 (d)  Working group       People  Do anything     To anything

A hammer can't do much except pound nails.  The promlugation rules of
G/p/govn (b) are similarly restricted, but in their own way; they can
only guide the passage and enforcement of other rules.  Now, if we
develop (d) network operation rules, then they'd likely be restricted
to the administration of vote-mirroring networks.  (The two rulesets
(c and d) would ordinarily be the issues of separate polls.)

We the working group (d) can do much more.  Although we inherited 3
specific aims, we can always change them.  Ultimately we're restricted
only by our imagination.

&gt;<i> ... Given that membership in the group is open to all and that it's
</I>&gt;<i> purpose is essentially the *oversight of inclusion* for the Open
</I>&gt;<i> Voting Network....is there any reason it shouldn't be regarded as
</I>&gt;<i> the *official* OVN admin group? In that case it's issues would be
</I>&gt;<i> the Networks issues (or the other way around) and it could
</I>&gt;<i> promulgate for both. Somewhere in the back of my mind I have an
</I>&gt;<i> inkling this is wrong....I guess I'm still stuck on what the
</I>&gt;<i> distinction is between the Network and the group (overseeing?) it.
</I>
No, I think you're right.  I just misundersood you.  I think the
working group should *bottom-line* the administration of the mirroring
networks.  Those networks have components (pollwiki and streetwiki)
that would be costly to replace if they got into the wrong hands.
<A HREF="http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture">http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture</A>

They should be in the hands of the people who are ultimately at risk,
which means the population at large.  I think the working group should
take responsibility for ensuring that happens.

&gt;<i> P.S. Actually, I think I may have messed up already by making too
</I>&gt;<i> many changes to your text...in fact I think I may have created
</I>&gt;<i> another draft entirely...in your name.
</I>
It's just that you edited my draft.  I actually like your changes, so
no problem. :-)

Later you created and initialized a draft of your own.  It's far more
difficult than it should be.  Others are having trouble with it, too.
Things should get easier as the mini-beta rolls out.  I hope to start
on it in a day or two.

Mike
