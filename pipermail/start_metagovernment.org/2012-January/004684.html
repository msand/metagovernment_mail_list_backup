<PRE>Hi,

since i have now joined the start list and also had some time to review
parts of the wiki and other material, let me do a quick recap of the main
points of my original message and re-state my proposal/request:

My name is George Anadiotis and i am a researcher and software systems
architect with a keen interest and background in distribution,
self-governance and social media, all of which i believe are part of what
is termed metagovernance. You can find some information on me and my work
on my blog &lt;<A HREF="http://ganadiotis.wordpress.com/">http://ganadiotis.wordpress.com/</A>&gt; as well as on my Metagovernance
user page &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ganadiotis">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ganadiotis</A>&gt;.

Recently i applied for a lightning talk slot for the upcoming
fosdem&lt;<A HREF="http://fosdem.org/2012/call-for-lightningtalks">http://fosdem.org/2012/call-for-lightningtalks</A>&gt;, providing the
text published on my
blog&lt;<A HREF="http://ganadiotis.wordpress.com/the-peer-to-peer-work-group-toolkit-project/">http://ganadiotis.wordpress.com/the-peer-to-peer-work-group-toolkit-project/</A>&gt;and
on
MixedInk &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mixedink.com/#/DecisionMakingP2PFOSS">http://www.mixedink.com/#/DecisionMakingP2PFOSS</A>&gt; as a description
of the talk. The page was set up rather hastily in order to meet the fosdem
application deadline, so unfortunately i did not research as thoroughly as
i could have - otherwise i would have found this group beforehand. Since
however i agree with and endorse the goals and principles of the group as
laid out on the wiki, and since my talk is in line with these as well, i
think it would make sense to:

1) Inject parts of <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/Generic">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/Generic</A> in
the talk description
2) Add the talk description in <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation</A>
3) Add a link to the above in the talk description and give the talk -if
granted the slot- as a member of the Metagovernment group, presenting it to
the fosdem audience

If there is consensus on this, i would like to do this asap since fosdem
lightning talk applications are currently being evaluated.

regards
George Anadiotis

&gt;<i> Hi George,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most importantly however, going through Metagovernance material and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mailing list archives i found out that there is a topic under
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussion&lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -December/004640.html&gt;, apparently primarily among the recipients of this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message, that is very much in line with things i was planning for myself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In order to keep this message short, i would like to point you to an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; outline published recently on my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blog&lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ganadiotis.wordpress.com/the-peer-to-peer-work-group-toolkit-pr">http://ganadiotis.wordpress.com/the-peer-to-peer-work-group-toolkit-pr</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; oject/&gt;and on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MixedInk &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mixedink.com/#/DecisionMakingP2PFOSS">http://www.mixedink.com/#/DecisionMakingP2PFOSS</A>&gt; and to give
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a little bit of background. The page was published as part of an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effort to attain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a lightning talk slot for the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fosdem&lt;<A HREF="http://fosdem.org/2012/call-for-lightningtalks">http://fosdem.org/2012/call-for-lightningtalks</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It was set up rather hastily in order to meet a deadline, so
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i did not research as thoroughly as i could have - otherwise i would have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already found this group. It seems to me however that my goal of setting
</I>&gt;<i> up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an open source project and standards to produce software for collective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision making, integrating relevant existing efforts is very much
</I>&gt;<i> aligned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with your goals and work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you also feel the same way, what i would suggest is to integrate this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal somewhere under the Metagovernment group and to present this -if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; finally granted the slot- as a representative of the group. Apparently,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this would also increase the chances of being given the slot in the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place. Regardless of this however, there is already a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mini-unconference being organised among myself and some of my contacts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (such as Marko Rodriguez &lt;<A HREF="http://markorodriguez.com/writings/">http://markorodriguez.com/writings/</A>&gt;, Ronny
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Siebes&lt;<A HREF="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ronny/">http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ronny/</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eidrien Perreau &lt;<A HREF="http://eidrienontech.blogspot.com/">http://eidrienontech.blogspot.com/</A>&gt; and Manuel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Waeckerle&lt;<A HREF="http://www.econ.tuwien.ac.at/waeck/staffmember.php">http://www.econ.tuwien.ac.at/waeck/staffmember.php</A>&gt;),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where the idea is to get together on fosdem and try to establish a
</I>&gt;<i> roadmap
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and specific technical and organizational steps for moving forward. I
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an approach in mind already - on the technical level it involves Apache
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Shindiq and OpenSocial, but most importantly on the organizational level
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also involves some sort of legal entity to support this, for all the good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasons and in the spirit you have also discussed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quoting your blog:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;To facilitate coordination and organisation so that these systems may
</I>&gt;<i> become
</I>&gt;<i> robust, usable and interoperable in order to form the basis for grass-roots
</I>&gt;<i> decision making and organisation. It appears that the technology and the
</I>&gt;<i> momentum are building, and the time has come to act and be the change we
</I>&gt;<i> want
</I>&gt;<i> to see, by building the tools and putting the practices to the test.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have tried to address this problem for the voting infrastructure with
</I>&gt;<i> (1)
</I>&gt;<i> and in general with (2). If you look besides communication media like
</I>&gt;<i> diaspora
</I>&gt;<i> or friendica, you will find that voting mechanisms in itself fit in between
</I>&gt;<i> these. No reason to duplicate, but also no reason to directly hardwire some
</I>&gt;<i> voting system in each communication medium. Instead we propose to address
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> issue of (delegated) voting in a modular open network approach. This allows
</I>&gt;<i> different decision systems to coexist even in the same communication or
</I>&gt;<i> drafting media, fitting to the grass roots nature of social movements. To
</I>&gt;<i> make
</I>&gt;<i> decision mechanisms interesting, a common network is necessary, otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> small user base of a specific tool quickly limits the audience.
