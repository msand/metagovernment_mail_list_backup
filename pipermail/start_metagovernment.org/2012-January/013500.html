</I>
I think it's not knowing the groups *realm of influence* that's confusing me. Given that membership in the group is open to all and that it's purpose is essentially the *oversight of inclusion* for the Open Voting Network....is there any reason it shouldn't be regarded as the *official* OVN admin group? In that case it's issues would be the Networks issues (or the other way around) and it could promulgate for both. Somewhere in the back of my mind I have an inkling this is wrong....I guess I'm still stuck on what the distinction is between the Network and the group (overseeing?) it.  Sorry, I must be really dense.

&gt;<i> The purpose of the working group (at least as I foresaw it) is defined
</I>&gt;<i> on our home page: <A HREF="http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network">http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Our aim is to ensure that: (A) no willing participant is excluded
</I>&gt;<i>  from the development of the technologies and practices of primary
</I>&gt;<i>  voting and consensus making within Occupy; (B) no alternative
</I>&gt;<i>  toolset, platform or practice is excluded from the overall
</I>&gt;<i>  development effort; and (C) each user may freely choose a provider,
</I>&gt;<i>  toolset and practices based on personal needs and preferences
</I>&gt;<i>  without thereby becoming isolated from other users who make
</I>&gt;<i>  different choices.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But this is open to discussion: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/G/p/hovn">http://zelea.com/w/G/p/hovn</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All of this *is* rather confusing, I agree.  It's a big design.
</I>&gt;<i> There's no easy way to understand *any* comprehensive system of
</I>&gt;<i> democracy - even looking across our own borders, the differences in
</I>&gt;<i> traditional systems can be very confusing - never mind something
</I>&gt;<i> that's radically different.  On top of it, there's all the
</I>&gt;<i> organizational and political stuff (working group, Occupy, relations
</I>&gt;<i> with existing political systems) which only adds to the complexity.

</I>&gt;<i> So again, this concerns voting on the working group's own issues (what
</I>&gt;<i> should our home page say?  who should be treasurer?).  The suggestion
</I>&gt;<i> is that anyone's vote counts, provided it was cast within our
</I>&gt;<i> mirroring network.  Right?  What do others think?
