&gt;<i> &gt; I still prefer (3) because I think the loss of flowing, readable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text in (1) is confusing.  To be sure, (3) doesn't come to grips
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the difficult edge cases and therefore isn't realistic, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's cleaner and easier to grok.

In (3), it's clear that the text on either side (left or right) is a
continuous whole.  Each side looks like a page.  In (1), it's not so
clear.  The text flow is inconsistent between the grey areas (common)
and the hot pink areas (differences).  In the grey areas, I read from
left to right across the screen.  In the hot pink areas, I am tempted
to do the same, and that's wrong.  It confuses my eye.

Also, the big gap between &quot;lorem&quot; and &quot;Ipsum&quot; is a problem.  There is
no such gap in the actual text.

PS, instead of this:

  ii) A hunk with a whole paragraph inserted on one side, and a
      single word changed just above and below it.

      Alignment of the single word pairs between the two sides
      is problematic here.

I should have said &quot;a single word changed *a little further* above and
below it&quot;.  So there should be common text *inside* of the first hunk.
This might break your layout.

Anyway, I think the horizontal layout is a lower priority than the
other beta work, as we discussed in IRC today.  I'll post some mockups
that use the existing vertical layout, soon.
