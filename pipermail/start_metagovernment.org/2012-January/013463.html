<PRE>Hi Ed
It is good to get your email, the topics you are asking about are 
complex and I think this is a pretty good discussion to have available 
on a forum, I have copied your message and the replies so far to the 
following forum on the E2D site, and will add a personal response there:

&gt;<i> Hi, folks!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My name is Ed Pastore. I am associated with the Metagovernment project, which as some of you know, is an end-goal-oriented project to build a new form of governance which completely removes the system of representation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of you describe E2D as a big step in our direction, which I may or may not agree with. I am still unclear on how E2D can be done in a way that does more harm than good. So I am presenting you with a challenge: convince me that E2D can be done well (not perfectly, I understand that, but well), and I will consider running for office here in the United States, perhaps even for the national house of Representatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to convince me (should you wish to do so), you need to help me answer these questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If I should win, what software can I use? The software systems being developed in Metagovernment are all in Alpha at best, but obviously Demoex is using something. Is that good enough to handle a U.S. Federal district?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Are decisions made by simple majority? The Metagovernment project has a lot of problems with the idea of majority rule, but I don't see how E2D can do anything better when trying to integrate into an existing majority-rule system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Do E2D parties normally restrict participation in decision-making to people within the representative's district? If so, then how can I enforce that requirement?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. How do E2D representatives deal with new business? That is, if something comes to a vote and the rep has not yet had time to present it to the public, then how does the rep vote?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help,
</I>&gt;<i>
