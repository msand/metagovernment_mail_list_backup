<PRE>I think your running would be great Ed. We can sell the E 2 D and many
would like it as well as your candidacy.
I do not believe there is a E 2 D party in USA yet ? If you find one let US
know. If not we can form one. I think need about 20 people and simple
forms.
YES Great idea Ed.

Wars have nothing to do with democracy, security, women's rights, peace or
stability. They are fought for money and power and nothing else.

&gt;<i> Hi, folks!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My name is Ed Pastore. I am associated with the Metagovernment project,
</I>&gt;<i> which as some of you know, is an end-goal-oriented project to build a new
</I>&gt;<i> form of governance which completely removes the system of representation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of you describe E2D as a big step in our direction, which I may or
</I>&gt;<i> may not agree with. I am still unclear on how E2D can be done in a way that
</I>&gt;<i> does more harm than good. So I am presenting you with a challenge: convince
</I>&gt;<i> me that E2D can be done well (not perfectly, I understand that, but well),
</I>&gt;<i> and I will consider running for office here in the United States, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> even for the national house of Representatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to convince me (should you wish to do so), you need to help me
</I>&gt;<i> answer these questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If I should win, what software can I use? The software systems being
</I>&gt;<i> developed in Metagovernment are all in Alpha at best, but obviously Demoex
</I>&gt;<i> is using something. Is that good enough to handle a U.S. Federal district?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Are decisions made by simple majority? The Metagovernment project has a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of problems with the idea of majority rule, but I don't see how E2D can
</I>&gt;<i> do anything better when trying to integrate into an existing majority-rule
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Do E2D parties normally restrict participation in decision-making to
</I>&gt;<i> people within the representative's district? If so, then how can I enforce
</I>&gt;<i> that requirement?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. How do E2D representatives deal with new business? That is, if
</I>&gt;<i> something comes to a vote and the rep has not yet had time to present it to
</I>&gt;<i> the public, then how does the rep vote?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help,
</I>&gt;<i>
