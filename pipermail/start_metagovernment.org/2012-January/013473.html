<PRE>Hello,

i would also like to participate, just filled in the poll. I can only make
it on Sunday and generally the later, the better.

On a related note, i would like to share with you my findings from a
meeting i just had with Prodromos Tsiavos&lt;<A HREF="http://www.tsiavos.org/?page_id=2">http://www.tsiavos.org/?page_id=2</A>&gt;,
a lawyer who specializes in open data/source projects, to whom i mentioned
the Metagovernment case. The take-away points from our discussion were:

   - Since at the moment it seems there are only individuals and not legal
   entities (e.g. companies/universities), this simplifies things a bit in the
   sense that there are more options and less hussle
   - The UK or Ireland are good choices for setting up a legal entity, as
   the requirements and upkeep there are rather minimal compared to other
   countries
   - A non-profit seems like a natural  match for this project's principles
   and goals, however the implications and requirements should be well
   understood by all participants before settling on any option
   - Some options for a suitable legal entity are a Community Interest
   Company &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company</A>&gt;, a
   Charity &lt;<A HREF="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/">http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/</A>&gt; and a Limited Liability
   Partnership &lt;<A HREF="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/llp.shtml">http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/llp.shtml</A>&gt;
   - Prodromos is also interested in the project and could contribute by
   providing some consulting

talk to you soon
George

Six people have responded to the poll, and there are three slots which
can accommodate five people, but none which work for all six.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro and Jonas... any chance one of you could be more flexible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, is anyone else planning on attending? If so, please fill out the poll. The last audio meeting was very engaging and useful, and this one should be quite good as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
