<PRE>You're right Steve, I'm overreacting.  Maybe we can stick our foot in
the door (mini-occupation) till we decide what else to do:
<A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/ovn/forum/topic/this-working-group-to-leave-the-nycga/?topic_page=2&amp;num=15#post-18082">http://www.nycga.net/groups/ovn/forum/topic/this-working-group-to-leave-the-nycga/?topic_page=2&amp;num=15#post-18082</A>

I nominate you to broker a decision on this issue:

I'll repost the governance stuff in the forum.

&gt;<i> Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> My quick response to your first paragraph would be....let's not abandon the nycga forums until the WG is imminently sure to be shut down.
</I>&gt;<i> There seems to be some possibility of acquittal and, in my mind, it might be good to gather as much ground there as we can...before we abandon ship entirely.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we could, as was suggested, petition the GA to let us stay. I don't want to get pushy...and yet I don't want to lose the WG as a venue for the development and implementation of the OVN in Occupy. Or perhaps we could petition another WG to post our forum(s) for us.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Ok... I think I get it. I've been imagining this working group is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; developing rules for the Network... when actually these rules are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; solely for &quot;a working group&quot; within the Network?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, or soley for the particular working group that's responsible for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Network, which is us.  Our name is confusing.  I might have chosen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrong.  Maybe we could re-dub ourselves the &quot;Outcast Voting Network&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then we might have this terminology:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  outcast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      A member of the working group.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      &quot;I am an outcast.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  outcasts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      Members of the working group, or the working group as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      &quot;We are the outcasts.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Outcast (or the Network)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      The architecture (broad design) that is common to all networks:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      <A HREF="http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture">http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      Identical to: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      &quot;Outcast is the world's most comprehensive design for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      e-democracy.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  network
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      A particular cluster of cross-mirroring vote-servers that are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      centered on a single pollwiki.  Most commonly this would be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      local network, e.g. dedicated to a particular city.  But it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      might also be federal, organizational or global:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      <A HREF="http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture">http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network#Technical_architecture</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      &quot;Why does Berlin have 12 vote-servers in their network, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      Kalamazoo only has 2?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And the purpose of this working group (other than to practice using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the tools) is to develop, oversee, and/or advance the Network
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; or... what? I&#8217;m not sure I understand the difference between the OVN
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and the OVN working group.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The purpose of the working group (at least as I foresaw it) is defined
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on our home page: <A HREF="http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network">http://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Our aim is to ensure that: (A) no willing participant is excluded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  from the development of the technologies and practices of primary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  voting and consensus making within Occupy; (B) no alternative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  toolset, platform or practice is excluded from the overall
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  development effort; and (C) each user may freely choose a provider,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  toolset and practices based on personal needs and preferences
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  without thereby becoming isolated from other users who make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  different choices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But this is open to discussion: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/G/p/hovn">http://zelea.com/w/G/p/hovn</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All of this *is* rather confusing, I agree.  It's a big design.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's no easy way to understand *any* comprehensive system of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democracy - even looking across our own borders, the differences in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; traditional systems can be very confusing - never mind something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that's radically different.  On top of it, there's all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organizational and political stuff (working group, Occupy, relations
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with existing political systems) which only adds to the complexity.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; We might define who is allowed to vote, I have added this and ask

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So again, this concerns voting on the working group's own issues (what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should our home page say?  who should be treasurer?).  The suggestion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is that anyone's vote counts, provided it was cast within our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mirroring network.  Right?  What do others think?
