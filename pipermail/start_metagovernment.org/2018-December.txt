Good stuff. Glad to see it up again. However this e-mail ended up in my
spam folder. Only now checked it.

Yeah, this mailing list is about useless, and surely more trouble than
it's worth. Even though I've set up a gmail filter so messages don't
get marked as spam, they still come in with a big yellow warning label
at the top. My recommendation would be for Ed to create a
"Metagovernment" Facebook Group (takes like 5 minutes, not counting
finding or creating the image FB shows at the top of each group),
email everyone on this list personally (so the message doesn't get
shoved into their Spam folders) asking them to join the new group,
then just shut this one down.

Speaking of which, I've set up a Group for proxyfor.me:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/proxyfor.me/ that I encourage everyone
to join. I shut down the PHPBB forum I had running on matchism.org due
to lack of interest and the fact that it was a significant time sink:
Damn Russian bots, they just ruin everything, including I guess the US
attempt at misrepresentative democracy ;-) They're pinging proxyfor.me
all the time, but since it's a fully custom system their script kits
aren't any help breaking in. Yet, anyway :-/

I've got the new version of the app with authentication done and am
now working on the proposals to be voted on. Which means the hard part
is done so it should be just another few weeks before we can resume
public testing on it...

    Scott

Update on this: I looked into creating a Metagovernment Facebook group
and discovered there already is one (created way back in 2008, long
before I joined this list). I tried to join it, but got no response.
It says "Pietro, Jacqueline and Mat?as are admins.": Could one of you
please let me in? I'd also volunteer to become an admin. I'd also
recommend just removing the approval requirement: The member names and
posts are already public so I see no advantage to putting a gate
across joining, especially if it isn't going to be monitored.

Also, the Metagovernment FB page itself is gone, which means the info
on http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate is obsolete (it doesn't
even list the FB group). When we get the FB group problem worked out,
I'll volunteer to edit that page to deprecate the mailing list and put
the FB group as the primary contact.

If anyone is still into the original mission of metagovernment,
there's a marketing opportunity here too: There are several direct
democracy groups on FB that are fairly active, but most are country or
region-specific. It'd be good to market the Metagovernment group as an
umbrella group for them to use to connect for more general topic
discussions.

Mailing lists I think are practically obsolete now that gmail is
classifying more and more of them as spam (this is not the only list
I'm having trouble with) so unless someone wants to moderate a Reddit
group (the only other viable alternative I'm aware of) we need to move
to the FB group if we're going to continue to collaborate in this
field.
  Thanks,
    Scott
