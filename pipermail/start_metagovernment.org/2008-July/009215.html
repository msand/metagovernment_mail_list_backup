I'm not so pessimistic... I think we're just slow to get some sort of  
organization because we don't have/want a leadership structure. But I  
believe your attempts to get the ball rolling are starting to have an  
effect, as you are providing something for other members of the  
project to dig their teeth into. We are just a little slow to act at  
the moment (like some others, I also have been traveling heavily for  
the past few months).

Would you like some space on the metagovernment.org server to run your  
code there? It would make it more visible and less dependent on your  
personal hardware...

Also, would it not be beneficial to maintain some code on SourceForge?  
People seem to give projects there a lot more credence if there is  
some (any) sort of code to be looked at.
