Not with recursive scoring, no. Getting scored by a huge number of  
people with average scores does very little to one's own score.  
Getting scored by a small number of people with high scores  
significantly effects one's score (positively or negatively).

That's not populism at all. But I would suggest that it is also not  
elitism: because of the community structure. If each user has a unique  
score within each community, then a high score in any particular  
community isn't saying &quot;I am better than you and deserve more power  
than you;&quot; instead it is saying &quot;I have done more to contribute to  
this community, and other people in this community respect those  
efforts and give me more credence in regard to future issues.&quot;
