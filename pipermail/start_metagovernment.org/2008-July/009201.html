A bit like Google (which seems to be working quite well ...)

At first, nobody. Any time a new community starts, everyone would have  
the base score within that community. People would distinguish  
themselves within communities over time, gradually building higher  
scores in their communities of interest.

This makes for a very flexible system of powerless leadership. It does  
allow people with high scores to have some dominance in a community,  
but only because they have proven their worth to the self-defined  
members of that community.

If those leaders start to go to far and take that community beyond  
what the mainstream thinks is acceptable, then a large number of other  
people can work together to down-score those leaders. Or perhaps they  
could even start a different community.


(I would modify my math in my earlier example, to say that a base  
score would be something like 1.001, so that any post has a slight  
positive value, even on the base score. Then simple time-rate-limiters  
can correct for people who try to mass-post in order to up their score.)
