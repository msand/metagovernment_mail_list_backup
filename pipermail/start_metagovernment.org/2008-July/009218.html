<PRE>Well the third one is the simplest, since anyone can clone the main
repository, those are always going to be there.

The first one is also simple; it contains the legislation, that at
some point was accepted into law.

The second one contains legislation, that somebody has proposed to be
merged into the first. If you want to get something to become law, you
commit it into the second repository, and it is then put up to
discussion and scrutiny. Eventually, if all are in agreement/a vote is
held/whatever the criteria are for acceptance, it moves into the main
repo.

The merging from the second into the first repo is done by the
software automatically, once the criteria are met.

I guess we could also do it with branches, with every piece of
legislation having its own branch, before it is merged into mainline,
but the general idea would stay the same.
