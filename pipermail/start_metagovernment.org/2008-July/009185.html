Hi Manuel,
let me explain better.

Why do people add tags.

In the last years , from when the whole tag boom exploded we have seen all
sort of tag system appear. And very few actually worked as good as they
could. Even the ones that were not that good still did something, which is
why people did not realise that their system could work massively better.

On the one side you have people adding tags.
On the other side you have people looking for resources.

And they will be looking for resources using tags.
Now which tags will they use?
If the default is that they will use the tags that everybody else has
placed, then they have no gain in adding a tag that is already there.

If someone has said that a resource is about energy, and they agree, and
they know that by looking at the entries about energy they will find it, and
that there is no way for them to tag something so that they look at all the
resources that THEY have tagged with energy, then they will not add the
(apparently!)  redundant tag energy again.

This is how flickr does it, and this is why flickr is such a crappy tag
system respect to what it actually could become. (It might have changed in
the meantime, haven't used it from along time, especially after yahoo bought
it).

but if instead each person can tag each resource with their own tag.
if they can just click on tags other have used to add those tags for
themselves too.
if when they search they can search for the tags that they have given
(especially  if this is the default, never underestimate the power of
laziness)

then it will work.
Then we will have each resource tagged with many tags.Many tags redundant,
but statistically meaningful.

then we have a well grounded mathemathical base on which we can base some
measure about
what is related to what
what is similar to what
what is related to where

So there are many ways in which a tag system can be made. Not all of them
work. And the differences in the making are quite subtle, but the
differences in the results are dramatic.


All this before we even consider people who are trying to game the system.
Even respect to those people the system as I describe it is more robust. You
can find more about it in my blog entry:

Tag clouds are hard to spam:

Pietro
