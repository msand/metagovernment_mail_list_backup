<PRE>Dear Manuel,
I would really love to help you.
Right now I am on a sailing trip with my dad, only connecting once a day to
check the mail from the local internet cafe. I will be available to program
only from the 20 of August, as before I have a series of conferences, and
appointments. But after that I am basically free, and I am already planning
to keep that time to do some work on the internet so whatever I will do, and
wherever I will be, I expect to be some place where I can use the net, and
work.

I also love python. But I don't know django. You will have to give me some
help on that.

For now I have not really concentrated on programming also because I did not
realise anyone was programming at all. My understanding was that we were
basically still deciding the structure of the beast.

Cheers,
Pietro
