This is why I had proposed a *recursive* scoring system, where  
voluminous posting might barely increment your score, but where a  
small amount of *good* posting could substantially increase your score.

I'm making up the math here, but imagine that each post you make has a  
base score of 1, and that it multiplies itself by your existing score.  
So a post which doesn't get any ratings from other users will not do  
*anything* for your score. But if a lot of users rate you positively,  
the multiplying effect from that post might go all the way up to 1.1  
or something. (It would have to be a more complex form of  
multiplication that I would hope the mathematicians in the group could  
figure out).

If additionally the ratings given from other users are first  
multiplied by *their* own scores, then this prevents a lot of &quot;gaming  
the system.&quot; A lot of gushing praise from low-ranked users won't help  
you very much at all, and a person with a very high score is by  
definition probably not someone who is going to go giving lots of high  
scores to their buddies just to help them out: it would be too  
damaging to their own reputation to do so.
