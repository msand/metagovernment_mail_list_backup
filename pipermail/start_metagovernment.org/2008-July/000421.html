<PRE>There are so many TED talks and google techtalks out there, with
content relevant to our project, might be worth collecting them.

Recently talking to a friend, I mentioned how tags could be used to
organize topics. He was interested for example in looking at only
resolutions relevant to his region and wondered how that could be done
in metascore. Of course at that point I had already mentioned how much
we rely on tags, but it hadn't occurred to him, that there could be a
tag for his region, with which to mark messages and resolutions.

What I'm getting at here, is that a general purpose solution, may
actually work, but it's not always intuitive for a newcomer. A similar
analogy is the unix console. It is very powerful, much more powerful
than any GUI I've ever come across. The thing is, that people need
some direction, before they can use it efficiently. A console of
course offers very little direction, it's just a prompt and you have
to know how to find your way around. Then again you aren't limited to
the things a programmer anticipated you would need a widget for.

I'm trying to counter this somewhat, with tag types. Every resolution
for example, has its own tag. If you mark a message with the tag of a
resolution, you've made kind of a hyperlink between those documents,
with the difference being, that this link can be given a score.

ciao
Manuel
