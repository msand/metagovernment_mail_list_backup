<PRE>Clay Shirky
gave an interesting talk tof ted.com

The talk is available at
<A HREF="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/clay_shirky_on_institutions_versus_collaboration.html">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/clay_shirky_on_institutions_versus_collaboration.html</A>

Now something in this talk is really relevant to our discussion.

At some point Clay present tags (you know one of my leit motif) as a way to
classify things bottom up.
I do agree with him in many ways, but I think there are better ways to use
tags, and Clays knows it, as we have emailed each other about it in the
past.

But what he sais is really important and relevant:
the presence of tags provides something (the ability to find all pics on
iraq, in the example) which if not would have needed an institution.

It is not just that we are now providing tags, and order, it is that we lose
the need for an institution to do the same job.

Another great example are blogs and journalism.
Are blogger journaists?
He claims the question is ill posed.
The important question was: how do we get people to receive the news?
and the answer to that question was: using journalism.
Now is becomeing more and more through blogs, and bottom up information.

It is not just that bloggers are appearing, it is also that this is emptying
the reason to be of old institutions.
What is the need of having television, when you can have the internet.
what is the reason to have journalism when you can bloggers (I know we are
still not there, but is getting there).
what is the reason to have institutions that will find you all pics on iraq
when you can have tags,


and now:

what is the reason to have government when you can have...
(please complete).

And similarly what is the reason that was at the base of having a
government.
Has that need been adressed in some other ways, that took away from the
government part of its reason d'etre?
