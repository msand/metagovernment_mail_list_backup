<PRE>I am in favor of user scoring and vote weighting. The allegory of my
position is principally based in human behavior instead of a method to
prevent mob rule.

First, I'm going to quote Christopher D. Ritter, what he said seems true to me:

&quot;When I first started working on a social network for my local community, I
learned two things:

1. My definition of social network wasn't any different than MySpace, and
2. My community had no idea why they should use the neighborhood website
instead of MySpace.&quot;

Because of the characteristics of Metascore, it is destined to be a
social network software. It would be unnatural to break apart from
this concept (and possibly a very bad idea). Virtual communities have
been object of study since 1980; so we can rely in abundant, quality
information to solve certain mechanisms of this project. Here is a
fine Wikipedia article:

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivations_for_contributing_to_online_communities">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivations_for_contributing_to_online_communities</A>

Following the article, you will see that &#8226;reputation&#8226; is a fair
important aspect to consider and the reason to adopt user scoring. We
join a virtual community in view of obtaining some kind of benefit.
After a given time &#8212;when we become dedicated contributors&#8212; we will be
seeking recognition by the other members.

Let's analyze an example. It might be &quot;Internet forums&quot; but nowadays a
genre of video games could be chosen as well... Massive Multiplayer
Online Role-Playing Games or MMORPGs for short
(<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMORPG">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMORPG</A>). You play a MMORPG (this time)
because you want to have fun. While gaming, consequently your
character's level raises. As you develop your character new abilities
are at disposition to interact with the environment and other players
(later that yields us to speak about &#8226;power&#8226;). Soon occurs that what
entertains you is not gaming itself, playing to level up your
character instead. Higher level, higher &#8226;reputation&#8226;.

(Legitimate) &#8226;power&#8226; is related to reputation; here is where vote
weighting enters in consideration. Humans pursuit &#8226;power&#8226; by
biological reasons (i.e. being the strongest, but in a figurative way
for cases of our interest). Vote weighting enables competitiveness, in
the field of proposing good solutions for the community. Higher
&#8226;reputation&#8226; deserves higher &#8226;power&#8226;, as a prize and a stimulus to
keep growing.

Concluding, to participate in communities through Metascore would be
possible with or without user scoring and vote weighting, although
permitting personal progress will make members to contribute much
more. It is an empirical fact.
