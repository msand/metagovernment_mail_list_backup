These people may be posting things which are &quot;populist&quot; but only  
within the context of their particular community. To say that  
something is popular within a small community is really just to state  
the definition of that community. I don't see this as a major problem,  
just an initial organizing act of the community, where tentative  
leaders begin to emerge.

Additionally, many people could post similar populist proposals, thus  
(particularly if we use a synthesis score &lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system#Synthesis_scoring">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system#Synthesis_scoring</A> 
 &gt;) only the ones which distinguish themselves as being genuinely  
helpful will accrue a lot of positive scores.

Also, there is a limit to the quantity of populist issues within a  
community. So someone could try some populist stuff to get some  
positive scores, but they will run out of ideas pretty quickly. If  
they can't keep earning high scores (for genuine, progressive  
proposals), then their high scores from their populist measures won't  
do them much good. Especially with time deprecation:

As for gaining a high score through mere volume of posts: again, we  
can just use a rate limiter so that people cannot flood a bunch of  
posts with the same community tags. There could be several codependent  
rate limiters, such as no more than 10 posts per community per hour,  
and no more than 50 per community per day, and no more than 500 posts  
total per day (completely made up numbers... they should probably be  
variables that get tweaked from time to time). Also, the base  
multiplier for a post should be just slightly over one, so that  
flooding a lot of posts has no real value (unless of course they  
really are a lot of genuinely good posts, in which case they might  
start getting scored upward).
