Sorry, haven't been active on this list for some time.

Seems to me, there should be a way to create an 'alternative' to a 
particular piece of legislation, or a section of legislation, that is 
marked as related to that legislation but not a revision of it.

This would be like a 'fork' in the legislative process, but 
programming-wise each branch of the fork exists as a separate body of 
proposed legislation that is related to other bodies of proposed 
legislation.

Similar to the way, in bugzilla, one can mark a bug as a 'duplicate' of 
another bug, here we are marking legislation as an 'alternative to' 
another piece of legislation. Whether or not it is an effective 
alternative is an issue that can be debated. So, a user can propose that 
legislation A is an alternative to legislation B, but others can say, 
no, this is not an alternative.

This could be useful in the case where 2 very similar pieces of 
legislation are proposed simultaneously. One could be marked as an 
alternative to another, prompting users considering one to then consider 
another.
