<PRE>&gt;<i> As an expansion of your idea about the ubiquity of tags... instead of
</I>&gt;<i> assigning tags to objects, how about taking the perspective that
</I>&gt;<i> everything is a tag?
</I>
There are allot of intriguing ideas you can come up with, in the
course of generalizing software. It allows the software to be used in
ways nobody could imagine. Tags certainly are a part of that. My idea,
is that you can have certain types of tags, and build certain
functionality around that. The thing is that when you go away from the
concrete, you have to either explain what the concept can be used for,
or people will have to be creative to use it for anything.

If we make everything a tag, we'll have to explain to people: &quot;A tag
can be anything, a Message, a Resolution, a Group, even you as a
Member are a Tag&quot;. I think this will cause more confusion than we can
afford.

&gt;<i> Manuel and Aur, how would you describe your coding efforts? Different
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions? Competing strategies? Other?
</I>
&gt;<i>From my point of view, a website based solution is the only option at
</I>the beginning. It is almost impossible to get people to download
software, so we won't gain much by following the idealistic view that
we should build a system in which we don't have to trust anyone.

This of course isn't ideal for our purposes, but I think a server
based software is our only option at this point. We just won't get
people to use anything else. That being said, the source code and data
will be open, so there is nothing to stop a more trustworthy party
from setting up their own servers.

&gt;<i> I admit I am not clear on what perspective you each have on the
</I>&gt;<i> development process, from a project management perspective.
</I>
&gt;<i>From a management perspective, I'd say we need more momentum and I
</I>don't feel that I can create that as a lone developer. Code speaks
louder than words, and we can talk all we want and write all we want
into a wiki, it will bring us no closer to our goal, if we can't
deliver something tangible. The majority of people don't like pushing
a train, they want to jump on one thats already going somewhere.
Especially in open source, where everything is based on voluntary
contributions, people should realize their responsibility for the
project and that although they are a part of many, ultimately
everything boils down to their contributions.  Everybody has something
besides this to do in their life and thats ok, after all we're not
paying any bills here (at least not yet). Personally I'm thinking of
how I can integrate this with my collage studies, hopefully I can do
my bachelors thesis in the context of this project. I encourage
everybody else, to give some thought, what they can change in
their life, so they can dedicate more time to this project.

Speaking as a developer, if any significant development is to be done,
it will probably be in the context of some organization interested in
adopting our system. The thing is, that if we frame it in the context
of &quot;we need your help to build this&quot;, it is like trying to sell them
something. That is much harder to do than telling them, &quot;this train is
going someplace good, with or without you, the question is only if you
want to be a part of it&quot;. Of course to do convince them of that, we
need some momentum, which at the moment I don't see in this community.
 Everything is basically academic at this point, which is why I
started the prototype in the hope that it would get something rolling.
Sadly that hasn't happened yet, and the one other enthusiastic coder
here, seems to be focused on the perfect solution, rather than
something which will be &quot;good enough&quot;tm for the start. All we really
need is something to show that we're going somewhere, I can't
emphasize this enough, so people feel compelled to join.
