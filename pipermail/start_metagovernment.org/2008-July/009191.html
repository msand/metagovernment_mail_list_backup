But your reasons are in my opinion reasons *against* user scoring!

Let me explain:

If we design the community so that participating starts feeling like a
game and you have an urge to raise your reputation, many (mostly
teenagers) will get addicted and start &quot;playing for the sake of
playing&quot;. They will discover that posting a lot of non-spam is enough
to raise your score (look at forums with score systems) and will be
encouraged to post a lot of volume, instead of a lot of wisdom.

This DOES give me an interesting idea: Why not score users based on
how much they contributed to the law? Any time a paragraph started by
a user reaches law status he gains a tiny score increment. There WILL
be measures needed to make sure people don't try to game this system
in ways that hurt it (for example, if it were line-based there would
be much spam because people write longer propositions in the hopes of
gaining a higher bonus if it gets accepted).
