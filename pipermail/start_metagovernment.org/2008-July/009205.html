I very much agree with all three of the points you are making here.  
Scoring factors should be:
- variable by community
- controlled by the community
- optional

We don't know what is really going to happen when the code encounters  
the general public, but I think it is prudent to at least allow for  
scoring as much as possible, so that communities can experiment with  
it and see what ends up working best.
