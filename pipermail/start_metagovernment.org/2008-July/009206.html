<PRE>Progress is slow, which I mainly attribute to lack of motivation. It's
hard to motivate yourself to code, when you're basically alone.
There's always a distraction and with no deadlines there's always the
temptation to procrastinate.

What I'm asking for here is some help. And by help I mean at least one
more programmer, if even only to discuss and coordinate with. There is
the adage among developers, that the ideal team size for a project is
one person, since then the communication overhead is the smallest. But
even then you need some feedback and currently that is lacking.

So following the motto of release early release often, I've set up a
development server, to which I will upload the latest version every
few days. Please join me, even if you don't know python or django,
this is very much a learning experience for me too. This will not be a
production system, you don't have to worry about writing perfect code.
I'll be more than happy to help get you set up.

The server is here:
<A HREF="http://mbarkhau.dyndns.org/">http://mbarkhau.dyndns.org/</A>
The code is still here:
<A HREF="http://freehg.org/u/mbarkhau/metascore/">http://freehg.org/u/mbarkhau/metascore/</A>


I'm looking forward to your feedback.
Manuel
