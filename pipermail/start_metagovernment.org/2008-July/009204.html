<PRE>&quot;A bit like Google (which seems to be working quite well ...)&quot;
Like Google or Digg. I don't think there is 1 correct way of doing this. The Google algorithm has developed and improved over a number of years but it still isn't &quot;finished&quot; - perhaps it never will be. In our case, I think if there is to be any complicated maths it would absolutely need to be open source. In other words individual communities could adapt the algorithm to their own needs. Ideally there would be a slick GUI to allow them to set the weightings and factors themselves through slide bars etc.
The owner of the algorithm is in a very powerful position indeed (see Google) and we should be conscious to make it a community controlled feature.
IMO we need to strongly differentiate between merit accumulated by content and merit accumulated by contributors. The maths and method of accumulation could be very different for each. Some communities may decide to only accumulate merit on one and not the other.

As a general point I think there is no way we can know the right answers at this stage. We need to initiate experiments we can learn from. These experiments don't have to work, just enlighten us a little further. I don't think we should rule anything out at this early stage.

At first, nobody. Any time a new community starts, everyone would have 
the base score within that community. People would distinguish 
themselves within communities over time, gradually building higher 
scores in their communities of interest.

This makes for a very flexible system of powerless leadership. It does 
allow people with high scores to have some dominance in a community, 
but only because they have proven their worth to the self-defined 
members of that community.

If those leaders start to go to far and take that community beyond 
what the mainstream thinks is acceptable, then a large number of other 
people can work together to down-score those leaders. Or perhaps they 
could even start a different community.


(I would modify my math in my earlier example, to say that a base 
score would be something like 1.001, so that any post has a slight 
positive value, even on the base score. Then simple time-rate-limiters 
can correct for people who try to mass-post in order to up their score.)
