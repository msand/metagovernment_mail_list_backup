<PRE>Hi

I am part of team that build new deliberative web-app (delib.org).
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6JoKmMJi_c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6JoKmMJi_c</A>

 I have looked at previous projects, and believe that there should be
several factors that should help a team to have a successful project:


   1. User Experience: most of the projects, lacked in this area. A team
   should understand what his users needs, and solve the with great UX.
   Without UX, users will have difficulties using our system.
   2. Good understanding of deliberative theory. Deliberation is a very
   complex field. Having good understanding in the filed, may help the team
   understand what they should develop.
   3. Money: developing a software is a long run effort. Most of us
   couldn't run so long, without monetary support.
   4. A good way to work together and develop together. Most of the
   projects I had met, where not so cooperative in their developing strategy.

Tal Yaron,
Delib.org

2015-07-06 21:01 GMT+04:00 Reid Millerd &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">mrpdublin at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Finally got around to this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All good questions, and to some extent I'll handwave and claim these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are details that will need to be worked out during the initial beta
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; testing and the normal upgrade cycle (even FaceBook wasn't built in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; day!)  That said, I would think that when the proposer does a revision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the pro/con/question categories get wiped and everyone who'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entered one of these would get an alert (and an email) asking if they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to repost their comment (perhaps after an edit) based on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current version of the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough. I think editing posts are asking for trouble and confusion
</I>&gt;<i> though. Edits gives power to the proposer to try and manipulate the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion by restarting it each time they preform an edit. It's easier for
</I>&gt;<i> the casual user to follow along if it's not changing ever week. The debates
</I>&gt;<i> will flow smoothly because no one can just change what they said which
</I>&gt;<i> might make the rest of the thread not make sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Free speech is indeed a major issue here and why I've never been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comfortable with the proposal of allowing moderators (or &quot;juries&quot;) to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make decisions like this. There are some good ones, but I've just run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into too many bad ones to trust that design. My sense is that it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; related to the SDAP problem with representative government: That
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; position just seems to attract people who are unsuitable to wield that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kind of power. How exactly the individual-based filtering will work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; again is an empirical question: We'll just have to try different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things until we figure out how well they work against the disruptive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and those who would try to game the system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But juries aren't an attainable position, they are assigned randomly. Say
</I>&gt;<i> the site picks 10 random users and asked them to uphold the rules of the
</I>&gt;<i> site e.g. no hate speech. Get the 10 to decide if the post made qualifies
</I>&gt;<i> as hate speech. If found guilty - time penatly from posting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Filtering has got to be dynamic: Everything will be in the stream but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people will be able to change their filters on the fly (hide/show
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; posts based on rating, poster rating, individual filter list, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Slashdot does something like this, but only with post rating.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately none of the big social media sites do what we need,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide negative feedback to trolls and other disrupters, because they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *benefit* from trolls: Their eyeballs count, perhaps even more than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-trolls because they spend more time on the sites, and because the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sites actually benefit from disharmony. Getting people riled up brings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them back, and FB and Reddit in particular seem to me to be designed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to encourage this type of behavior. Unlike those sites ours will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually benefit from shutting trolls down or sending them back to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Reddit/FB/Slashdot/etc. as long as it's clear that they weren't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; censored by the system but instead just ignored, or perhaps even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actively shunned, by the community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have rules of the site, if you can't follow them you can't post, seems
</I>&gt;<i> like a equally valid method of dealing with trolls. This assumes we can
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee only one account per person though. Otherwise it's a lost cause
</I>&gt;<i> either way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, my proposal that it's not the *system* doing this, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individuals using it. In your analogy it would be like giving everyone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the theater noise-canceling headphones that they can adjust the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; level of external sound volume that passes in. Sure, some of them will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; miss the initial call of &quot;fire&quot;, but those with their filters set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lower (or off) will start moving and the rest will see that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough, I hope this method works as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Posts that come later in my system have the effect of bumping all its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; parents posts to the top of their feed lists temporarily, they all take
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the vitality of the brand new post but as that post grows older and
</I>&gt;<i> starts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to lose overall score the parent posts revert back to their score once
</I>&gt;<i> it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; overtaken. Because the brand new post has a lesser chance of receiving
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; many props it loses score at a much quicker rate than it's more visible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; parent posts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sounds pretty fancy! I need to look at the Slashdot system more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because it does something like this but I read a lot of complaints
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about how good comments get buried because they're associated with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crappy post higher up...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing stopping the good comments from being posted again in a more
</I>&gt;<i> visible location though. If the post is only relevant to the bad comment
</I>&gt;<i> it's doesn't matter if it gets buried along with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But my argument is that it's better being an actual public job that
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can see happen online. Getting multiple people to submit redrafts will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ensure the best summarization of proposals and encourage a standard of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've no problem with professionals (indeed paid professionals) doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most of the work. That's what the Managers are in the Matchism
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal, and where I expect most of the proposals will come from. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just have a problem with paying *everyone* to do this kind of work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because unless you have a very sophisticated bidding and management
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system (something like what Ned has proposed with Blinap) it just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems to me to open up too many avenues for gaming the system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not everyone is getting paid, only the one's who are skilled re-drafters.
</I>&gt;<i> The managers in your system are getting chosen and paid by the public as
</I>&gt;<i> well no? Same concept, experts in the field.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (snip)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I think there would be interest in getting paid for activity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that you had expertise in. Like karma for Reddit, there's always
</I>&gt;<i> somebody
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; stepping in and sharing their knowledge. Here you're helping run the
</I>&gt;<i> world,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and getting money for it, it's even more incentive to contribute.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Competition breeds innovation. If there's money to be made in finding
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; greatest solution to a problem, I believe innovation will occur and
</I>&gt;<i> we'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; all benefit from it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is reminiscent to me of the government design proposal in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Looking Backward&quot; (i.e., eventually all companies merge into one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; giant conglomerate and politics *becomes* corporate management). IMHO,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; however, the two systems are fundamentally incompatible: I'm a strong
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proponent of capitalism as an economic system because it's clear to me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that it works better, and is more compatible with human nature, than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any of the alternatives. But capitalism requires regulation and that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can only be done by people who are operating outside of that system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Matchism requires volunteer work to function, but is also designed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; minimize the amount of effort any one individual has to expend. If we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can get it down low enough (like in the realm of what people now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expend on FB and other social media) we won't have to pay them to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The capitalist system's is driven by the profit motive in money that
</I>&gt;<i> theoretically would destroy everything around it to achieve that profit.
</I>&gt;<i> Our system's driven by the motive of well being to the greatest number of
</I>&gt;<i> people. I don't think that will need regulating the same way. Money is just
</I>&gt;<i> a reward for some hard work not the end goal of every proposal.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No problem: Rome wasn't built in a day!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Right. I'm actually considering having 4 categories: pro, con, Q&amp;A,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and &quot;discussion&quot;. The latter might be like Slashdot or Reddit, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; hopefully would increase the quality of the pro/con sections by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; allowing an outlet for some of the less well thought out comments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; When you've really got your position worked out, then and only then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; should you polish it up and put it into the pro or con list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Sounds good. Where's the bar at for adding your post to a pro/con list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; though? Anything stopping you from just throwing it up there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> immediately?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Also do you intend to have a proposer address his con list ever to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; more agreeable to more people? Will the pro/con lists be reset upon an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> edit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of the proposal?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All good questions, and to some extent I'll handwave and claim these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are details that will need to be worked out during the initial beta
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> testing and the normal upgrade cycle (even FaceBook wasn't built in a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the pro/con/question categories get wiped and everyone who'd

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to repost their comment (perhaps after an edit) based on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current version of the proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; 3) People gaming the system, say adding a pro to the con list instead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; and getting it 5 star rated so it stays at the top. Makes for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; moderating/flagging that isn't necessary otherwise.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; People will always do stuff like this, and sometimes even just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; accidentally. Flagging would seem to me the best way to combat this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Gaming by gang-up-rating would require large-scale cooperation which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; should be easy to detect, and again flag. I'm not sure it's going to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be necessary, but have put flagging trolls as *people* rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; just as posts in the spec. Get too many posts flagged as trolls, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; *you* get flagged as a troll and people will then have the option of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; filtering *everything* you do out of their feed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Here our designs split a bit and the question of free speech comes up. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; think that there should be complete transparency in all communications
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that punishable actions should be taken to these trolls in the form of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; penalties before they're able to post again. Your concept would allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trolls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to run rampant but allow people to ignore them by filtering them out,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I think most people would choose to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Free speech is indeed a major issue here and why I've never been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comfortable with the proposal of allowing moderators (or &quot;juries&quot;) to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I think it dangerous to hid away and marginalize an entire group from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; their opinion heard and leaving it up to past flagging to determine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; legitimacy. Again at some point one of these trolls might reform or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; have something valuable to say. I don't feel it's right to hid what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they say
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; because a group of people have deemed it irrelevant. I instead argue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; every post should remain public and viewable but that individuals be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> given a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; time out for abuse of the posting code. One by one we treat these trolls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; like criminals and give them a trail where the evidence is produced and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; verdict is reached by an outside jury, everything remains transparent.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Filtering has got to be dynamic: Everything will be in the stream but

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actively shunned, by the community.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; We can draw from the shouting fire in a crowded theater analogy or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; wolf. You prefer to automatically block these people from ever being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; except by others like them (which might only serve to encourage them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; further), I say we give them the benefit of the doubt and punish them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> later.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, my proposal that it's not the *system* doing this, but the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individuals using it. In your analogy it would be like giving everyone

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (snip)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; My site is a fully threaded forum yes. I assume yours will be as well?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Yes, although I'm still a little worried about sorting based on rating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with this: Do posts that come later somehow depend on context derived
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; globally from earlier posts, even if they don't specifically attach to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; any of them? I think I see this effect on Slashdot sometimes...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Posts that come later in my system have the effect of bumping all its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; parents posts to the top of their feed lists temporarily, they all take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the vitality of the brand new post but as that post grows older and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> starts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to lose overall score the parent posts revert back to their score once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; overtaken. Because the brand new post has a lesser chance of receiving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; many props it loses score at a much quicker rate than it's more visible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; parent posts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sounds pretty fancy! I need to look at the Slashdot system more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because it does something like this but I read a lot of complaints
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about how good comments get buried because they're associated with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crappy post higher up...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; But my argument is that it's better being an actual public job that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; can see happen online. Getting multiple people to submit redrafts will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ensure the best summarization of proposals and encourage a standard of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; quality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've no problem with professionals (indeed paid professionals) doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most of the work. That's what the Managers are in the Matchism
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal, and where I expect most of the proposals will come from. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just have a problem with paying *everyone* to do this kind of work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because unless you have a very sophisticated bidding and management
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system (something like what Ned has proposed with Blinap) it just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems to me to open up too many avenues for gaming the system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Good luck with that ;-)  My hunch is we can't really do either: making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; law/policy is just always going to be boring for us neurotypicals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; because power just doesn't fascinate us the way it does the SDAPs. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; work is a funny thing: People will insist on being paid far more then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; they're really worth if it's anything they don't enjoy and don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; absolutely have to do. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have the budget to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; pay anyone who knew what they're doing (do you know how much political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; consultants make? The competent ones make 6 figures, and the good ones
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can make several times that).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; They're only making 6 figures because there's a market for it. Removing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of the personal financial gian from politics lowers these wages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; dramatically.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, but that would be communism ;-) Instead of just trying to remove
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the financial gain I recommend we remove the people who would exploit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this design and the jobs they use to do so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I think there would be interest in getting paid for activity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that you had expertise in. Like karma for Reddit, there's always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somebody
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; stepping in and sharing their knowledge. Here you're helping run the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and getting money for it, it's even more incentive to contribute.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Competition breeds innovation. If there's money to be made in finding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; greatest solution to a problem, I believe innovation will occur and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we'll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; all benefit from it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is reminiscent to me of the government design proposal in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Looking Backward&quot; (i.e., eventually all companies merge into one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> giant conglomerate and politics *becomes* corporate management). IMHO,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however, the two systems are fundamentally incompatible: I'm a strong
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proponent of capitalism as an economic system because it's clear to me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it works better, and is more compatible with human nature, than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any of the alternatives. But capitalism requires regulation and that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can only be done by people who are operating outside of that system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Matchism requires volunteer work to function, but is also designed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minimize the amount of effort any one individual has to expend. If we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can get it down low enough (like in the realm of what people now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expend on FB and other social media) we won't have to pay them to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Scott
