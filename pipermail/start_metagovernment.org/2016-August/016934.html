And I of course think this is exactly backwards! IMHO Citizen Juries
are just worse examples of representative democracy than what we have
now: Not only do the same SDAPs end up serving in both, but you
introduce the additional negatives of lack of competence and lack of
experience. For example, take a look at this 2014 survey paper on
these Citizen Juries:
<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361400166X">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361400166X</A>

The key question is, &quot;Who ends up serving on these juries?&quot; If you
read the article, of the 37 papers they surveyed exactly ZERO made any
measure of the psychological profile of the participants. Indeed, I
found it baffling that they didn't even attempt to make any
ideological assessment (e.g., asking for party affiliation) of the
participants. If you don't do this, and then compare your results with
the profiles of The People as a whole, how can you possibly make any
claim that the outcomes reflect what The Will of the People would be?

Reading the paper (and probably all the papers they used, and indeed
all the people who organized the juries) one comes away with the
overwhelming sense that they believe that &quot;all people are the same, so
they're interchangeable&quot;. To the extent there is any attempt to
account for individual differences they account for SES or age (as if
all poor people have the same opinions or that all 60-year-olds will
vote the same). And this doesn't even account for my previous claims
about jury duty (to summarize, only chumps end up serving on juries
because anyone who values their time and/or understands what a farce
the justice system and these health-care committees are will find a
way to get out of serving).

I recently read Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions
(<A HREF="http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf">http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf</A>).
I actually don't recommend it because it seems to me it's neither a
practical guide to facilitating a revolution (unlike, say, Hoffer's
The True Believer) nor does it provide any real insight into the
causes and timing of these revolutions. What it does provide is a
*lot* of examples of how blindly researchers follow their research
paradigms even when it should be obvious to them that there is
something seriously wrong with them. IMHO we're seeing exactly the
same thing in the fields of &quot;Political Science&quot; (a misnomer if there
ever was one) and Public Policy. It's clear as day to me that pretty
much all the research in these fields is assuming the equivalent of
the earth being flat and that the sun revolves around it. Don't you
see it too?
