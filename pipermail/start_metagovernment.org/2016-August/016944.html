It's *exactly* what I'm saying. There are countless examples of cases
where the majority of The People prefer one thing and yet the
government does something else. Guns and abortion in the US are just
two examples (a substantial majority of people prefer more
restrictions on both). If the people of the US had had to vote to
approve the Iraq war, it never would have happened. That was the
&quot;ordering Zyclon B&quot; moment for us, where people were willing to follow
an authoritarian leader when they wouldn't have voted to start a war
themselves. This is according the polls, and that doesn't even count
that a significant minority of people weren't even sampled (polls are
terrible at sampling non-politically-active people, a problem that has
only gotten much worse as people drop land-line service).


----&gt;I think you are very much wrongIf 10% of the people went out to protest the Iraq war the Iraq war would never have happened

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt;&#160; Never said such a thing

</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure the rest of the population is smart enough to figure this out
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; This is why I was saying you cant vote a government out every two minutes
</I>
You said it before, and now you just said it again. Please answer the
question: Do we give people the right to remove any government
employee from office by a simple up/down vote, or do we prevent them
from doing so because they'll abuse that tool?


------&gt; I think you are not sincere or you have some real deep comprehension problemsReread my document&#160;
