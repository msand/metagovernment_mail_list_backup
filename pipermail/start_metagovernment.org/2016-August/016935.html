<PRE>&gt;<i> measure of the Will of the People
</I>
I have to admit that I have an issue with this concept &#8220;The Will of the People&#8221;

I mean what do the majority of people want? A better life, better job? Ask them to be more specific and you lost them already. Some they could probably debate in vague lines on certain issues, again with no clear idea or resolution - just that they are not happy with it. Not only they don&#8217;t understand the complex socio-economic environment but most of them they don&#8217;t even want to actively participate &#8211; other than perhaps a lazy vote in most cases based on a superficial expression. 

I will go even further, if it were for the will of the people &#8211; we will be still living in trees, not even in caves, because it was the non-conformist mind, the bold, the explorers, who got us were we are now. We will stil be stuck in our &quot;primordial gut feeling&quot;, if it were not for these faulty/heretics :)

Now, that you mentioned brexit &#8211; they casted a vote without even questioning what is the plan once they get out, and how will that be better, not even bother to ask the basic questions. 

A measurement of the will of the people will end in just something this &#8211; All I want is a better life. Sorry but that is what every living thing wants and how would that help say in trying to make a decision on a critical piece of infrastructure? 

I do believe in democracy as a right of all people to participate in decision making directly or through representatives but that comes with a responsibility to be knowledgeable of what it takes. Is knowledge, research, passion and a lot of hard work that got us where we are not the &#8220;primordial&#8221; gut feeling.

So, yeah, people want to be happy, have a decent job, nothing too hard if possible, maybe win the lottery, have few cans, watch movie or a match on the telly, basics. There are just a few who struggle and dedicate an important part of their lives to try to understand, learn, research and make things better.

I'll third that, and also agree that it is impractical to evaluate the quality of the decision if you're going to use *outcome* as the ultimate criteria. Many (most?) of the decisions made at the government level take years to fully implement, and even after decades there is often debate about attributing particular benefits or calamities to particular decisions (i.e., it's a complicated world).

&gt;<i> In my opinion attempting to evaluate a decision is same as trying to

</I>&gt;<i> paradox by itself.
</I>
This, I think is going too far: IMHO, and in the Matchism philosophy, you can, and indeed must, evaluate the quality of a decision immediately after it is made. But the criteria is not the outcome, but instead whether the decision properly reflects The Will of the People at the time the decision was made. Using this criteria, *most* of the decisions made by government are poor ones, because they don't reflect The Will of the People nor indeed is that usually even an important component in the decisionmaking process.

Now most people are going to probably argue that most people are stupid, or at least ignorant, and that so we need someone more educated or experienced or &quot;wise&quot; to at least act as intermediaries.
They'll point to things like the Brexit vote and the various anti-gay-marriage referenda as examples, but my claim is that this has it exactly backwards: You either believe in democracy or you don't and if you do you can't consider those &quot;bad&quot; decisions, but merely issues that the common moral sense had not progressed enough yet (e.g., if you redid the Colorado Amendment 2 vote (a referendum about gay marriage, which passed in 1992), it would overwhelmingly fail today).
My claim is that this is all as it should be, and the Supreme Court stepping in and overriding that law was a prime example of why relying on oligarchs like that is wrong, both in a moral sense and in a practical (social engineering) one. We would have gotten to the same place as a people eventually, just as we will on things like Citizen's United (an equally abhorrent decision by the Supreme Court, which ruled that Money is Speech) but when we do it will be morally as well as legally enforceable which lawmaking by the Supreme Court of course isn't.

So, our goal should merely be to get a proper measure of the Will of the People, not hold them to some arbitrary standard of decisionmaking ability and output quality.
  Regards,
    Scott
