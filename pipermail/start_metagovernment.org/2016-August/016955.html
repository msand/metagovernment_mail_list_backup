I told about my experience (as someone who uses reddit occasionally) to you (who does not use reddit). My point was that your fears would not materialize for a metagovernment-like discussion on reddit. But you can keep bringing arguments like &quot;first they came&quot;.
&gt;<i> &gt; Is a revolution a part of your plan?
</I>&gt;<i> Of course! Isn't that why we're all here?
</I>I do not get it. In your optimistic scenario I did not see any revolution.

</I>&gt;<i> of decades for it to become popular enough to consider a replacement

</I>Popular enough in what capacity? I am trying to understand if you expect it to be applied to some binding voting before it is &quot;popular&quot; or proven to work. Or do you expect people to use it in an idle mode, like voting on non-binding internet resolutions?

That's my point: *I* have to go to the site to get my information
rather than the information coming to me. This just seems backwards to
me and why I've always preferred mailing lists to forums.

The second reason is preservation of the record: I have copies of
every message posted to this list (mostly as a backup in case the site
goes down), in addition to, of course, my &quot;Sent Mail&quot; folder. All of
this is easily searchable because *I* control access to it. Good luck
finding anything posted months ago on Facebook...

&gt;&gt;<i> Or by blatant censorship of their posts. Check it out yourself: Any

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deleted posts (indeed entire subthreads) deleted as you're able to

You must be pretty boring, then ;-) But this is also a very lame, and
yet very dangerous, argument. E.g., it's the topic of &quot;First they
came...&quot;:
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...</A>

Again, this doesn't really apply to the potential of Metagovernment
discussions being held on a forum, but *does* mean that it'd be
totally inappropriate to try to host any sort of actual government
operation on one like that. You simply can't allow censorship like
that in an actual government because it will result in the dissidents
setting up their own government someplace else (i.e., civil war).

&gt;&gt;<i> When the revolution comes it will be a full replacement of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these &quot;elites&quot;, not some way to try to influence them into doing what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they're supposed do (i.e., &quot;represent&quot; us)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is a revolution a part of your plan?
</I>
Of course! Isn't that why we're all here? What is the purpose of the
Metagovernment site other than to try out alternatives to our current
government with the goal of replacing it when we find one that works?

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not able to commit to any timeframe as yet, not only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because I don't know what burdens there will be on my time, but more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> importantly because I'm not even sure *I* understand the environment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well enough yet to produce a successful product. Certainly it's much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more complicated environment than the last time I did this kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing (creating a startup software company). But I know a lot more now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than I did then and it is also very familiar in a way and so I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every confidence that eventually I will see the path forward and be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to get to coding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what is your optimistic (but also realistic) scenario? As of now. If
</I>&gt;<i> this is not too much to ask.
</I>
Couple/few years to create a new system (assuming someone actually
working on it full time), somewhere between a few years and a couple
of decades for it to become popular enough to consider a replacement
for our existing governments. But I only started researching and
designing in this field about 2 years ago and so still have a lot to
learn and a lot to consider in the design. I'm very mindful of the
fact that it took 60 years before anyone tried to actually implement
the plan specified in the Communist Manifesto but only about 4 years
for Facebook to go from idea to major social force.
