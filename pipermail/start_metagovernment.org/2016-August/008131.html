Apologies for the delay in getting back to these: I was travelling (no
internet, and even no cell phone service for most of that trip) when
they came in and only now have uncovered the pile that accumulated on
top of them ;-)

&gt;<i>  As for the consent, there was one interesting remark, that decision-making
</I>&gt;<i> in metagovernment should have differnt decision-making method from what we
</I>&gt;<i> see as optimal in politics. In other words metagovernment is different from
</I>&gt;<i> politics in some important aspects
</I>&gt;<i>  - it is entirely online, but politics do not need to be (see deliberative
</I>&gt;<i> democracy)
</I>&gt;<i>  - human needs are mostly absent in metagovernment (see J. W. Burton or Ian
</I>&gt;<i> Shapiro)
</I>&gt;<i>  - size / scale of groups is different
</I>&gt;<i>   - metagovernment is full of educated people, nobody will tell you here:
</I>&gt;<i> take my vote, use it as you like
</I>
Agreed: The Metagovernment project is not a good sample to test
delegation with. It's too small, and we're more likely to want to be
proxies than be the people who rely on them.

&gt;<i>   - and more
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you see as optimal decisio-making method for metagovernment?
</I>&gt;<i> Do you find it possible to keep decision-making in metagovernment and
</I>&gt;<i> political decision-making separate?
</I>
I would have thought that a consensus-building model would have been
the most appropriate for running Metagovernment: Small group,
homogeneous group, common goals, etc.. But our runs with Vilfredo and
Loomio along with a lot of reading about soviet communism and communes
have disabused me of that, and not because I think there's anything
special about our little group: Getting humans to agree on pretty much
*anything* is like herding cats. It's just the way we are, I'm afraid.
This conclusion fortunately *does* reinforce two of the main concepts
in the Matchism manifesto:

1) People are genetically programmed to defer to others who are
willing to take responsibility (aka &quot;leaders&quot;). Therefore the most
natural form of government for us humans is a system where the vast
majority of decisions are made by designated
experts/leaders/executives.

2) The major thing missing from our current systems is accountability:
Our instinctive deferential behavior evolved in an environment where,
e.g., those who voted to go to war with a neighboring band or to kill
and eat that mammoth spotted nearby were the same people who were
going to risk their lives in the effort, providing an automatic and
built-in check for reckless or self-serving behavior. Since it is no
longer possible to do that (though I'd love to send Obama in to be a
spotter and possible collateral damage before every drone strike), we
have to create a system where The People supply that accountability
correction. A simple open-voting majority-rules voting system I
believe will supply this missing ingredient (delegation not being a
necessary component of that, but merely an expedient).

&gt;<i> Imho, here we should discuss our integrity of goals and tools (not to be as
</I>&gt;<i> Bolsheviks). From my point of view, it is simple. Agora Ekklesia
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making cannot be used for metagovernment. From my point of view, it
</I>&gt;<i> is obvious to me that we should use another method in metagovernment.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand if your method may be used in metagovernment as well as in
</I>&gt;<i> politics, you may be in a tricky situation. Still I thing you should make
</I>&gt;<i> difference between metagovernment and politics for the reasons above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for me, I propose allourideas.org for decision-making about the
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment site.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you support?
</I>
Probably a coup: Ed seems to have lost interest in this project and
IMHO should turn responsibility over to someone else (maybe you? ;-)
That person would just take full responsibility for fixing the site,
including writing an appropriate Home page. The rest of us will
kibitz, but ultimately defer to our chosen (indeed even self-chosen)
leader.

I've got nothing against allourideas.org or other collaborative
environments, but I believe it is a mistake to consider them tools for
managing government. They're tools that an executive might want to use
to try to figure out what The People want when there is doubt, but
IMHO the vast majority of the time there should be little or no doubt
as to what the right thing to do is and so having a vote (or just
doing it and expecting a correction later on) is the proper way to
govern.

    Scott
