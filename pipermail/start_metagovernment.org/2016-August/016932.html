<PRE>&gt;<i> metagovernment systems decision index
</I>
Probably the most obvious case to examine in terms of likelihood to generate good decisions or any decision at all. Say,

-         Ingredients: smart people, from various backgrounds, all interested in making things better &#8211; so from that perspective it gets a good score

-         Interaction/ground rules and setup systems &#8211; there is just the basic debating of personal point of views with no general consensus on say  find a common ground of action and define a general framework of values and properties universally accepted regardless of any proposed system &#8211; so that has a low score 

So you can say that even if here you have smart people, well intended and ready to put some effort into it, there is some major &#8220;interaction/setup&#8221; problem which prevents them in generating any good decision as a group &#8211; rather than just individual &#8211; which defies the point of the existence this group.  

So rather than looking say at decision to make the metagoverment.org website looking one way or another you should probably ask yourselves if you actually collaborate/organize/work together well? If not the likelihood for the outcome of the website is either to never have any (like now) or to have something which only a small number will people will use, which given the scope of the group.

Hi,

 

thank you for replies. I see the main problem of the index might be that it is not linear, that the individual properties will interact with each other in an unexpected way. So, there is a need for simplification imho.

 

To achieve that we may impose the restriction that we already have and that are constant. If same for all decisions we may ignore them. Say

 

group = metagovernment (the group is changing slowly, we will ignore the change)
topic = web sites (metagovernment.org and other presentations)
environment = not important (Ed, or who has passwords must solve emergency anyway)

The  number of methods is limited so we may go and score each method that we would like to use.

What do you think?

if needed here is the link to the doc again <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6LVXpWZaJUZJ0mV8X7oRNkNjn5ieoAou7ZMLMRDYfI/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6LVXpWZaJUZJ0mV8X7oRNkNjn5ieoAou7ZMLMRDYfI/edit?usp=sharing</A>
