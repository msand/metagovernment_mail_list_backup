<PRE>Time for me to speak up again. As always, I agree with the majority of your
points Scott. As before though the proxy based mechanism of decision making
creates more problems than it solves I think.

I will define what I believe your proxy system to be, correct me where I'm
wrong.

- A new user to the system would choose multiple proxies from different
industries to represent their vote because they don't have time to read
every proposal.

- The new user would plug in a number of their core beliefs into the system
and then the system would recommend proxy users to attach to based on their
past voting habits. i.e. one proxy for agriculture issues, one proxy for
transportation issues.

- These proxies would only control the new user's vote in industries that
the new user agreed to.

Here is the first problem, what happens when multiple proxies intersect?
Many proposals will surely encompass more than one industry at once, our
new user will have two or more proxies voting different ways. Will it then
be up to the new user to read all the different reasons for each proxy vote
and determine which one best represents them?

- Once the proxies vote the user will be able to change their vote if they
don't agree with their proxy.

A bunch of questions here. What if their proxy doesn't vote, are they allow
to abstain? Will there be an alert that they haven't cast a vote? Will all
the users then have to read the whole proposal in the reduced time limit
now? What if you've got a proxy who's got a proxy? You agree with the
initial proxy but then your proxy changes their vote which in turn changes
yours. Do you still have time to change yours back to the initial vote? How
long is the time period? This confirmation of votes could go on for way too
long.

- Popular users will no doubt emerge and be in control of thousand of
votes, essentially deciding results themselves.

Is that not too much power for an individual user? Will these users not be
targeted relentlessly to vote one way or another, coerced by money and
other means?

The main question is if this is really necessary in order to battle the
SDAP's influence? Seems to me like this system also is able to be gamed by
those willing to spend the time to gather the followers. I think I have a
better system for this problem, I will share once these questions are
addressed, just to make sure I have it right.

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Again, I don't expect anyone to be convinced to dump a lot of work

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; quality of the prototype.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you give a specific example how people might start using your system,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the first 100-1000 users?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a marketing issue and so doesn't need to be decided now. But
</I>&gt;<i> I'd assume that the hooks I have to other like-minded groups (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> links scraped from places like <A HREF="http://www.participatedb.com/">http://www.participatedb.com/</A> and/or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Viable Way&quot; on FB) would get that number very easily. I'm actually
</I>&gt;<i> more concerned about having *too many* people wanting in before the
</I>&gt;<i> system is really ready and then disappointing them or burning them out
</I>&gt;<i> than not having enough to prove viability. Once it's stable (and well
</I>&gt;<i> liked), scaling up should happen extremely rapidly (and of course the
</I>&gt;<i> system needs to be designed to run on AWS or something that can scale
</I>&gt;<i> with demand, even if demand gets very large very rapidly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Who will be writing proposals? What kind of proposals?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At first, probably mostly me, although I'm going to crib from a wide
</I>&gt;<i> variety of sources (existing and proposed laws/ordinances, review of
</I>&gt;<i> appeals court cases, Avaaz/MoveOn/etc.)  And they'll not be wimpy
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;what should the MG Home Page be&quot; sorts of things, they'll be about
</I>&gt;<i> abortion, gun control, education (e.g., vouchers), and other stuff
</I>&gt;<i> that even our existing misrepresentative governments are afraid to
</I>&gt;<i> take on. This is what will make the project compelling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I've said before, IMHO doing this part right is probably even more
</I>&gt;<i> important than having the software fully optimized. I've therefore
</I>&gt;<i> already started collecting proposals and working out how to make them
</I>&gt;<i> digestible by regular people (budgeting and criminal penalties being
</I>&gt;<i> two of the biggest problem areas at present). I of course am aware of
</I>&gt;<i> the wannabe dictatorship perception problem this presents and so will
</I>&gt;<i> have a Vanguard of the Elite (i.e., another mailing list or forum) to
</I>&gt;<i> assist. The People will most likely accept that, even though if they
</I>&gt;<i> know anything about previous revolutions they certainly shouldn't ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What organization might use your system?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Organization&quot;? Perhaps you misunderstood: I aim to replace *all*
</I>&gt;<i> government, worldwide. I need to update matchism.org on this point: At
</I>&gt;<i> first I sort of entertained the &quot;start small&quot; philosophy that has been
</I>&gt;<i> adopted by Loomio and other projects, but now see that this is
</I>&gt;<i> unworkable. We go big, or go home: IMHO it's impossible to generate
</I>&gt;<i> the kind of intensity that we'll need to succeed by limiting ourselves
</I>&gt;<i> to HOAs that want to figure out where to put their bike racks...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Will the votes be binding from the very beginning?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This too is a marketing issue rather than a design or implementation
</I>&gt;<i> issue and so doesn't need to be decided now. My current thinking is
</I>&gt;<i> just to be up front about the plan: That it's a beta test for an
</I>&gt;<i> actual replacement government. The votes won't be binding until a
</I>&gt;<i> majority of The People vote to make them so. At that point, a Critical
</I>&gt;<i> Mass having been assembled, the revolution will have already occurred.
</I>&gt;<i> This requires some faith that it won't happen so quickly that it
</I>&gt;<i> destabilizes civilization itself although I myself have some fear that
</I>&gt;<i> this is indeed the way it will go, particularly if it gets picked up
</I>&gt;<i> in a country experiencing a civil war or other unrest (this issue is
</I>&gt;<i> dealt with in more detail on matchism.org). My backup faith is that if
</I>&gt;<i> we do a good job of tapping into the Will of The People, Neurotypical
</I>&gt;<i> behavior will be robust enough to prevent any major disasters even if
</I>&gt;<i> the SDAPs try to capitalize on the instability (preppers, ugh).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I find description of your system (1-3) to be similar to what I have in
</I>&gt;<i> mind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or what Matteo was proposing. Except that I am willing to incorporate
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; matchism engine as an option, while you are insisting that it be only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; permitted mechanism of selecting proxies. But you still have not explain
</I>&gt;<i> how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you are going to start (see the above questions please). For me, it is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; huge gap in your explanation. That people are naturally interested in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; politics and are naturally efficient may not be enough to expect them to
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; engaged in non-binding votings on some imaginary laws.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, this is (just) a marketing issue, and in my experience is the
</I>&gt;<i> least of our problems. It's only a problem the other projects have
</I>&gt;<i> died from because they don't have compelling content and that's simply
</I>&gt;<i> not going to be a problem with the MatchSys. There's a whole lot of
</I>&gt;<i> people who can't get enough of some of these things and put the fear
</I>&gt;<i> that having sat on the sidelines prior the point when Critical Mass
</I>&gt;<i> has been reached will result in changes they don't agree with actually
</I>&gt;<i> being implement will I'm sure inspire most of them to least follow the
</I>&gt;<i> process. E.g., we'll have the zealots on both sides of the guns and
</I>&gt;<i> abortion issues paying close attention, but I figure even knowing that
</I>&gt;<i> will encourage everyone else to at least watch too. Watching will be
</I>&gt;<i> extremely low cost: You'll get one email or text a week. That's it:
</I>&gt;<i> Once you learn to trust your proxies, you won't even have to read past
</I>&gt;<i> the subject line.
