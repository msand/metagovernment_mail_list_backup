<PRE>Personally I consider a good measure of how good a decision is, the
percentage of people who after several years, looking back at that decision
think that it was well done, and going back they would take it in the same
way.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; measure of the Will of the People
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have to admit that I have an issue with this concept &#8220;The Will of the
</I>&gt;<i> People&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure a lot of people do, as they have probably since hierarchical
</I>&gt;<i> political systems developed. I'm also sure they're wrong ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I mean what do the majority of people want? A better life, better job?
</I>&gt;<i> Ask them to be more specific and you lost them already. Some they could
</I>&gt;<i> probably debate in vague lines on certain issues, again with no clear idea
</I>&gt;<i> or resolution - just that they are not happy with it. Not only they don&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> understand the complex socio-economic environment but most of them they
</I>&gt;<i> don&#8217;t even want to actively participate &#8211; other than perhaps a lazy vote in
</I>&gt;<i> most cases based on a superficial expression.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Spoken like a true SDAP: You can't trust the people because they're
</I>&gt;<i> poorly informed and/or too emotional and/or just don't have the right
</I>&gt;<i> priorities. This attitude is exactly what got us into this mess, and
</I>&gt;<i> in the EEA would probably get you killed as being more trouble than
</I>&gt;<i> you're worth: My claim in the Matchism manifesto is that people who
</I>&gt;<i> think like this (and exhibit other anti-social behavior) are actually
</I>&gt;<i> far more common in the general population now than they were in the
</I>&gt;<i> Pleistocene because they didn't survive very long back then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that everyone can't be an expert on everything, but if you
</I>&gt;<i> ignore the fact that people who want to make the rules/decisions are
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically different (i.e., they want different things) than the
</I>&gt;<i> rest of us, you're not ever going to solve these political problems
</I>&gt;<i> before some SDAP pushes the button that will end the species.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will go even further, if it were for the will of the people &#8211; we will
</I>&gt;<i> be still living in trees, not even in caves, because it was the
</I>&gt;<i> non-conformist mind, the bold, the explorers, who got us were we are now.
</I>&gt;<i> We will stil be stuck in our &quot;primordial gut feeling&quot;, if it were not for
</I>&gt;<i> these faulty/heretics :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Non-sequitur: The People have nothing against inventors or explorers
</I>&gt;<i> or even leaders even though most of them are not those things. They
</I>&gt;<i> *do* have a problem with these self-selected elites dictating how
</I>&gt;<i> things are going to be with no regard for what The People want. In the
</I>&gt;<i> EEA they could just opt out when these conflicts occurred (or, take
</I>&gt;<i> action to end the wannabe dictator, solving the problem permanently).
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately SDAP technology (i.e., armies wielded by kings, lords,
</I>&gt;<i> slave owners, misrepresentative government, etc.) makes that much more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to do now. But the SDAP need the control of the
</I>&gt;<i> neurotypicals to keep them from recklessly starting wars or
</I>&gt;<i> discriminating against some segment of the population just as much as
</I>&gt;<i> the neurotypicals need them to explore/engineer/organize/operate the
</I>&gt;<i> systems we all rely on now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, that you mentioned brexit &#8211; they casted a vote without even
</I>&gt;<i> questioning what is the plan once they get out, and how will that be
</I>&gt;<i> better, not even bother to ask the basic questions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, it was a bad decision. But not because the decision was left
</I>&gt;<i> to The People, but because the people that made the initial proposal
</I>&gt;<i> did a half-assed job and the people that explained it to the people
</I>&gt;<i> essentially manipulated them into voting against their own interests.
</I>&gt;<i> But this is just a design flaw in the system the people were operating
</I>&gt;<i> in, and IMHO you therefore can't use it to reject the idea that The
</I>&gt;<i> People should get to make the decisions that are required to run a
</I>&gt;<i> government. We can use technology to reduce the incidence of bad
</I>&gt;<i> decisions like this, but, as with my gay-marriage example, sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> The People will lag the moral pioneers more than some of the pioneers
</I>&gt;<i> (probably including most of us) would like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A measurement of the will of the people will end in just something this
</I>&gt;<i> &#8211; All I want is a better life. Sorry but that is what every living thing
</I>&gt;<i> wants and how would that help say in trying to make a decision on a
</I>&gt;<i> critical piece of infrastructure?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you write &quot;you'll have a better life&quot; in a proposal that people
</I>&gt;<i> vote on? You can't, so your example is bogus. People will have to vote
</I>&gt;<i> on specific things, and again, they don't have to be experts on all
</I>&gt;<i> theses things, they just have to find people who would vote the same
</I>&gt;<i> way they would if they *were* experts. Misrepresentative government
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't work this way. At all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do believe in democracy as a right of all people to participate in
</I>&gt;<i> decision making directly or through representatives but that comes with a
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility to be knowledgeable of what it takes. Is knowledge,
</I>&gt;<i> research, passion and a lot of hard work that got us where we are not the
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;primordial&#8221; gut feeling.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why are you here, then? Seems to me we already have exactly the system
</I>&gt;<i> you prefer...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, yeah, people want to be happy, have a decent job, nothing too hard
</I>&gt;<i> if possible, maybe win the lottery, have few cans, watch movie or a match
</I>&gt;<i> on the telly, basics. There are just a few who struggle and dedicate an
</I>&gt;<i> important part of their lives to try to understand, learn, research and
</I>&gt;<i> make things better.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, and your preference seems to be that we let these people make
</I>&gt;<i> the decisions for everyone. Why not wish for a benevolent dictator
</I>&gt;<i> while you're at it? That'd be even more efficient. And unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> just as delusional.
