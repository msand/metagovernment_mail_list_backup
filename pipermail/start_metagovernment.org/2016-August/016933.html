I'll third that, and also agree that it is impractical to evaluate the
quality of the decision if you're going to use *outcome* as the
ultimate criteria. Many (most?) of the decisions made at the
government level take years to fully implement, and even after decades
there is often debate about attributing particular benefits or
calamities to particular decisions (i.e., it's a complicated world).

&gt;<i> In my opinion attempting to evaluate a decision is same as trying to predict

</I>&gt;<i> itself.
</I>
This, I think is going too far: IMHO, and in the Matchism philosophy,
you can, and indeed must, evaluate the quality of a decision
immediately after it is made. But the criteria is not the outcome, but
instead whether the decision properly reflects The Will of the People
at the time the decision was made. Using this criteria, *most* of the
decisions made by government are poor ones, because they don't reflect
The Will of the People nor indeed is that usually even an important
component in the decisionmaking process.

Now most people are going to probably argue that most people are
stupid, or at least ignorant, and that so we need someone more
educated or experienced or &quot;wise&quot; to at least act as intermediaries.
They'll point to things like the Brexit vote and the various
anti-gay-marriage referenda as examples, but my claim is that this has
it exactly backwards: You either believe in democracy or you don't and
if you do you can't consider those &quot;bad&quot; decisions, but merely issues
that the common moral sense had not progressed enough yet (e.g., if
you redid the Colorado Amendment 2 vote (a referendum about gay
marriage, which passed in 1992), it would overwhelmingly fail today).
My claim is that this is all as it should be, and the Supreme Court
stepping in and overriding that law was a prime example of why relying
on oligarchs like that is wrong, both in a moral sense and in a
practical (social engineering) one. We would have gotten to the same
place as a people eventually, just as we will on things like Citizen's
United (an equally abhorrent decision by the Supreme Court, which
ruled that Money is Speech) but when we do it will be morally as well
as legally enforceable which lawmaking by the Supreme Court of course
isn't.

So, our goal should merely be to get a proper measure of the Will of
the People, not hold them to some arbitrary standard of decisionmaking
ability and output quality.
  Regards,
    Scott
