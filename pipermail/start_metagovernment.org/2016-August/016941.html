<PRE>&gt;<i> Spoken like a true SDAP
</I>
What are you on about? What SDAP? I am talking about scientists, researchers, inventors, artists, and in general people who dedicated a good part of their life exploring and creating things. These people have been hit on from both side, exploited by &#8220;leaders&#8221; and ridiculed by The People and vast majority of them could barely make the money to pay their bills, maybe a few got lucky to get their name in the history books, many other were unknown. Even in this modern day and age, researchers can barely afford a living and they are being ridiculed by The People as nerds and weirdos. 

&gt;<i> You can't trust the people because they're poorly informed and/or too emotional and/or just don't have the right priorities. This attitude is exactly what got us into this mess
</I>
I disagree, what got us in this mess is actually The Will of the People. They form the majority and they voted both the systems and the leaders which we enjoy today. And they didn&#8217;t do that at gun point and they had access to enough information to rule out any excuse why they still voted same again and again. 
This excuse that people are poorly informed does not quite hold water, at least in the past few decades, where books and most recently internet is wildly available. It only takes a few google searches to get you the basics. On the other hand, I recall while being in schools over the years that only a small number of people were actually interested to learn and understand while the majority they won&#8217;t care less other than perhaps to pass the exams &#8211; so they had an equal chances to education, they just made a different choice to not care about learning and rather live their lives guided by fear/emotion, and there is no one to blame there other than themselves.  Like today, Facebook and social networks are full of people who stair at the facts, literally in front of them, still they refuse or wont bother to give a read or even a little consideration, even when they are literary being begged  by others  to at least think about it they won't care - see again Brexit. 

And tell me, if you were to build a house &#8211; would you be hiring a team of people who have no clue what so ever about building? And would you go on and live in that house at a risk that at any time you collapse on top you? Not even the people themselves will do that,  they will hire professionals. 

&gt;<i> but if you ignore the fact that people who want to make the rules/decisions are psychologically different
</I>
At fundamental level we are not different, we all want the same, we all want better lives,etc. I can see psychological problems, anxieties, etc &#8211; which some can control with logic were many others not and they become victims of manipulation.

&gt;<i> Why are you here, then? Seems to me we already have exactly the system you prefer...
</I>
You completely misunderstood me. The system we have has nothing to do with voting in knowledge of the fact and reality as it stands. 
On the contrary, the system we have thrives on votes earned by psychologically matching people desires and fears. 

Doubt that? Think how political campaigns are run, how political discourses are created. They analyse various psychology niches in masses and prepare their platform and speeches to serve/match their psychological needs and anxieties. Best, most recent example, being Brexit.  

What I want are real facts and a system of people who care to work hard and know what to do.  As I always said, I will vote that one politician who will point a finger at the people themselves and tell them if they want a change they will need to get off their lazy a*s and get involved. I&#8217;m tired of all these miracle guys and their empty promises and magical solutions for which people fall because it&#8217;s easier than face the reality. The problem is not the elite or a minority evil &#8211; there will always be bad guys trying to take advantage of weak for their own profit. The problem is the majority who vote them in power in the first place.

&gt;<i> Right, and your preference seems to be that we let these people make the decisions for everyone
</I>
Again you got me wrong, by these people I people I mean ANYONE who care to get seriously involved, read about issue at hand, do a little bit of research and don&#8217;t let themselves manipulated in the lack of knowledge. There is no excuse for not spending a little bit of time to gather the real facts and give some real thought. So, I want people who participate in decision process to care and be capable not ignorant and lazy and driven by anxieties as it is today.

I'm sure a lot of people do, as they have probably since hierarchical political systems developed. I'm also sure they're wrong ;-)

&gt;<i> I mean what do the majority of people want? A better life, better job? Ask them to be more specific and you lost them already. Some they could probably debate in vague lines on certain issues, again with no clear idea or resolution - just that they are not happy with it. Not only they don&#8217;t understand the complex socio-economic environment but most of them they don&#8217;t even want to actively participate &#8211; other than perhaps a lazy vote in most cases based on a superficial expression.
</I>
Spoken like a true SDAP: You can't trust the people because they're poorly informed and/or too emotional and/or just don't have the right priorities. This attitude is exactly what got us into this mess, and in the EEA would probably get you killed as being more trouble than you're worth: My claim in the Matchism manifesto is that people who think like this (and exhibit other anti-social behavior) are actually far more common in the general population now than they were in the Pleistocene because they didn't survive very long back then.

I agree that everyone can't be an expert on everything, but if you ignore the fact that people who want to make the rules/decisions are psychologically different (i.e., they want different things) than the rest of us, you're not ever going to solve these political problems before some SDAP pushes the button that will end the species.

&gt;<i> I will go even further, if it were for the will of the people &#8211; we 
</I>&gt;<i> will be still living in trees, not even in caves, because it was the 
</I>&gt;<i> non-conformist mind, the bold, the explorers, who got us were we are 
</I>&gt;<i> now. We will stil be stuck in our &quot;primordial gut feeling&quot;, if it were 
</I>&gt;<i> not for these faulty/heretics :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Non-sequitur: The People have nothing against inventors or explorers or even leaders even though most of them are not those things. They
*do* have a problem with these self-selected elites dictating how things are going to be with no regard for what The People want. In the EEA they could just opt out when these conflicts occurred (or, take action to end the wannabe dictator, solving the problem permanently).
Unfortunately SDAP technology (i.e., armies wielded by kings, lords, slave owners, misrepresentative government, etc.) makes that much more difficult to do now. But the SDAP need the control of the neurotypicals to keep them from recklessly starting wars or discriminating against some segment of the population just as much as the neurotypicals need them to explore/engineer/organize/operate the systems we all rely on now.

&gt;<i> Now, that you mentioned brexit &#8211; they casted a vote without even questioning what is the plan once they get out, and how will that be better, not even bother to ask the basic questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed, it was a bad decision. But not because the decision was left to The People, but because the people that made the initial proposal did a half-assed job and the people that explained it to the people essentially manipulated them into voting against their own interests.
But this is just a design flaw in the system the people were operating in, and IMHO you therefore can't use it to reject the idea that The People should get to make the decisions that are required to run a government. We can use technology to reduce the incidence of bad decisions like this, but, as with my gay-marriage example, sometimes The People will lag the moral pioneers more than some of the pioneers (probably including most of us) would like.

&gt;<i> A measurement of the will of the people will end in just something this &#8211; All I want is a better life. Sorry but that is what every living thing wants and how would that help say in trying to make a decision on a critical piece of infrastructure?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
How do you write &quot;you'll have a better life&quot; in a proposal that people vote on? You can't, so your example is bogus. People will have to vote on specific things, and again, they don't have to be experts on all theses things, they just have to find people who would vote the same way they would if they *were* experts. Misrepresentative government doesn't work this way. At all.

&gt;<i> I do believe in democracy as a right of all people to participate in decision making directly or through representatives but that comes with a responsibility to be knowledgeable of what it takes. Is knowledge, research, passion and a lot of hard work that got us where we are not the &#8220;primordial&#8221; gut feeling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why are you here, then? Seems to me we already have exactly the system you prefer...

&gt;<i> So, yeah, people want to be happy, have a decent job, nothing too hard if possible, maybe win the lottery, have few cans, watch movie or a match on the telly, basics. There are just a few who struggle and dedicate an important part of their lives to try to understand, learn, research and make things better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right, and your preference seems to be that we let these people make the decisions for everyone. Why not wish for a benevolent dictator while you're at it? That'd be even more efficient. And unfortunately just as delusional.
