I think it was mentioned in a post by Bryan Ford. Thanks for you references, I will check them later.
&gt;<i> Since the Armytage proposal didn't make it through peer review
</I>As you see, it did. 

&gt;<i> people still throwing up a bunch of math in an attempt to appear rigorous
</I>Approximations were made at the stage of choosing a model. After that step the exact results could be derived (with a pretty basic math). I see nothing wrong with is. The choice of model is of course debatable.
&gt;<i> The first bus-sized flaw in his model is the assumption that voters are all rational
</I>To some extent, the voters are rational. But if you are going to be so picky about approximations, you should use the same level of rigor in justifying your approach.
&gt;<i> he also calls for a strong judiciary to override popular sentiment, which I also consider offensive: We are not children and we can be trusted to make our own decisions without the interference of some sort of elite who's job it is to protect us from ourselves.
</I>I do not remember in what context he says it, probably in that we need to be careful when experimenting (as the model is approximate). But his message is very clear, to let people to decide for themselves. He would exactly agree with your sentiment of people not being children.

&gt;<i> He's completely missed the point that aggregation of power *causes* corruption: Paying people or even recognizing them for carrying a lot of votes will only lead to them pandering or being preyed on by the special interests
</I>Nothing forces people to give their votes to people who are preyed on by special interests. Give it to your friend or vote yourself.
&gt;<i> not to even mention the bigger problem is that&#160; these &quot;superdelegates&quot; evolve into a poor match for increasingly larger numbers of people
</I>Again, nothing forces all the votes to flow to a small number of delegates. People will choose whom to delegate, on what issues, and this can be changed at any moment. I think you are again treating people like children.

Just out of curiosity, how did you find that? Apparently it never got
published, but even so is (occasionally) being cited, probably because
there is so little other published work in this area. It's been many
months since I did a literature search so I just went up to CU and did
one but only found two other related articles, which I've put on my
site for your convenience:
<A HREF="http://matchism.org/refs/Blum_2016_LiquidDemocracy.pdf">http://matchism.org/refs/Blum_2016_LiquidDemocracy.pdf</A>
<A HREF="http://matchism.org/refs/Guerrero_2014_Lottocratic.pdf">http://matchism.org/refs/Guerrero_2014_Lottocratic.pdf</A>

The second one should be of particular interest to Ned because it's a
sampling-based proposal, albeit it seems to me even less practical
than Blinap (e.g., pay each of the people selected at random to
represent us a million dollars a year? Yeah, right ;-)

Since the Armytage proposal didn't make it through peer review,
ripping on it here may be akin to shooting fish in a barrel, but in
this field we get so few barrels we probably should take the
opportunity each time, if only to keep our skills sharp:

1) It's coming up on 20 years since I got my PhD, but it's sad to see
people still throwing up a bunch of math in an attempt to appear
rigorous. When will they learn that when there are holes in your model
big enough to drive a bus through that there's no point in trying to
make the math work? It just makes the article (and the field, in this
case political economy) look pretentious.

2) The first bus-sized flaw in his model is the assumption that voters
are all rational and so the only difference between them is the amount
of information they have. We of course see this all the time,
especially in the deliberative/consensus based system proposals.
Unfortunately, it's just not true: People have a wide range of
personality types and deeply entrenched (perhaps even genetically
programmed) biases that are impossible to overcome with logic and
information exchange. Religious belief being only the most obvious of
these: There are people who are just born to believe in God and those
who just never will, no matter how much conditioning you subject them
to (Stalin's and Mao's failed attempts to suppress religion being good
evidence of the former, and persistent atheism (leading to the
Renaissance) in the Dark Ages for the latter). Unfortunately both of
the other articles I linked to above also share this flaw.

3) He's not really drunk the Kool-Aid: His proposal (like many I see
promoted on this list) is that delegates should be some sort of
&quot;apprentice representative&quot; system where the &quot;real&quot; vote will be
endorsed by some sort of more elite group (he also calls for a strong
judiciary to override popular sentiment, which I also consider
offensive: We are not children and we can be trusted to make our own
decisions without the interference of some sort of elite who's job it
is to protect us from ourselves. In fact, IMHO this thinking is
exactly backwards: It's the elite that we need protection *from*).
This watering down is also nail in the coffin of his proposal from a
marketing point of view: Any sort of deference IMHO makes a proposal
unacceptably weak and so I predict that people just won't participate
because it promises no more *actual* power than being a member of
MoveOn or Avaaz does, but with a whole bunch of extra work.

4) He's completely missed the point that aggregation of power *causes*
corruption: Paying people or even recognizing them for carrying a lot
of votes will only lead to them pandering or being preyed on by the
special interests (not to even mention the bigger problem is that
these &quot;superdelegates&quot; evolve into a poor match for increasingly
larger numbers of people, which is the very problem we're trying to
get away from!). This is why *limiting* the power of the proxies, by
limiting the number of votes each can carry, is a key component of my
system.

5) He's assuming the legislature must micromanage the government (and
apparently the economy and everything else) and so requires lots of
full-time decisionmakers. This too is a common assumption, and is also
found in both of the other articles. But IMHO this is looking at it
wrong: The purpose of the legislature is merely to regulate these
things. Creating a strong (but firmly controlled) executive branch
will drastically reduce the number of decisions The People will have
to make, as will turning as much over to the private sector as is
possible (again, because all you have to do is regulate it, not
provide a zillion rules that specifies *how* everything has to be
done).

All in all, I say it's worth reading, but mainly to see how far behind
the academics are in actually coming up with workable proposals. If a
new system arises it's going to come from outside both academia and
the government (i.e., from someone like one of us ;-)
