<PRE>I'm working up a letter to the editor for the local paper, which currently
features a non-stop stream of letters about Trump that I believe for
the most part are missing the point. What do you think: Should being a
psychopath disqualify one from being president?

Certainly the best-known psychopaths in leadership positions (Stalin
and Mao) had a negative impact on the people they governed, but should
the fact that Donald Trump meets the clinical criteria for being a
psychopath/sociopath disqualify him from being president?

Although the popular conception of psychopaths is that they're all
criminals (they're only 1 or 2 percent of the population, yet make up
over a quarter of the prison population) the vast majority of them are
living successful, if not driven, lives all around us. They're highly
over-represented among the ranks of CEOs, surgeons, and lawyers, for
example. We seem be strangely fascinated by their skills and abilities
to &quot;get things done&quot; (Frank Underwood in the Netflix series &quot;House Of
Cards&quot; being another textbook example).

I've seen a lot of comparisons between Trump and Hitler, but although
there is some overlap in campaigning technique (fearmongering,
demagoguery, etc.) Hitler wasn't a psychopath. He was instead in
Altemeyer's classification a Double High (high SDO and high RWA). The
appropriate comparison would therefore be between George W Bush and
Hitler (besides the two having similar psychological profiles, the
justifications for the invasions of Poland and Iraq had significant
similarities and I believe are the completely predictable result of
putting Double Highs in positions of power).

So the question we need to ask ourselves (and Trump supporters) is:
Are the predictable downsides of putting a psychopath in power
(aggregation of power, ruthlessness, discrimination against the weak,
etc.) a worthwhile trade for their higher levels of success in
achieving the goals they have set for themselves? And: Given how
predictive these psychological profiles have proven to be, shouldn't
we examine *all* of our candidates using these tools? My prediction
for what will happen if we start doing this is that we'll realize that
we need a new political system (perhaps a direct democracy with
delegation) because the people serving in our current representative
democracies can't adequately represent us because psychologically they
are very different from the rest of us...

</PRE>
