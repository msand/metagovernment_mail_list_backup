<PRE>How convincing your ideas are will affect how many people you find to work with you (unless you can pay them) to launch your service. Maybe this is something you do not care about. 

&gt;<i> The new systems will either work or they won't: There
</I>&gt;<i> will be no need for debate (or friendly audiences) to convince people
</I>&gt;<i> to jump on the bandwagon. If it works the success itself will be all
</I>&gt;<i> the marketing and justification you (we) will need.
</I>Could you describe your plans more specifically: how you are going to start, how do you get initial users, what will they be doing at your site, what will motivate them, what do you mean by success? Without these details our discussion is a bit too abstract.

 &gt; I have yet to receive a single claim that anything on the site is inaccurate or illogical
There are myriad services that are internally consistent and logical and that nobody uses. The most important question is why you think an average person will want to use your site (before the success stage).

Speaking from the engineering perspective, I don't think any of us
should be so delusional as to think that we're going to convince
anyone of anything based on our hopes/plans/dreams/scientific
explanations. The new systems will either work or they won't: There
will be no need for debate (or friendly audiences) to convince people
to jump on the bandwagon. If it works the success itself will be all
the marketing and justification you (we) will need. Which is why we
need to get it right and address any valid criticisms in the design
phase. IMHO at this point a hostile audience is actually a far more
useful thing to have, and something that I in particular can't get
enough of (e.g., to the extent I have received any criticism of the
stuff on matchism.org it's been only that it makes readers
uncomfortable, either because it's over their heads or merely because
it challenges their worldview. I have yet to receive a single claim
that anything on the site is inaccurate or illogical and to the extent
there is a criticism at all for the most part it's that it's just &quot;too
much&quot;).
