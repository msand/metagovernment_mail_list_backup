</I>There are democracy, directdemocracy, liquiddemocracy subredits. But the last two not very active. Yeah, that may be the problem. But nor do I find this list extremely useful, unfortunately. There are several somewhat active posters here, but my interest overlap with the list is maybe 1.5 people or so.
&gt;<i> But you've got a Catch-22 here: How can they change the system to one
</I>&gt;<i> that enforces this without simultaneously allowing them to change the
</I>&gt;<i> new system too?
</I>You do not necessarily need to formally change the system. You can design a system parallel to the Congress, convince people it properly represents people, demand that representatives use it or vote them out. It is not a new idea, see Placeavote for example.

&gt;<i> LOL! Again! Half the people in the US living paycheck to paycheck with
</I>&gt;<i> zero savings to handle emergencies. IMHO that's almost always because
</I>&gt;<i> they've made bad *personal* monetary decisions.
</I>Compare it to a country that accumulated a huge debt (about its GDP) and without any emergency! Those people look quite reasonable in comparison.

</I>But you should also prioritize what you can realistically achieve. Extra complexity will always play against you. What is your plan? Do you care if people use your system? Do you have a time-frame in which you expect it to start working and attract people's attention?
This is actually very important. I could respond to the rest of your arguments. They are thoughtful and well presented even though I do not fully agree with many. But the prospect of spending lots of time just talking and not much done bothers me. I have seen it a lot on this list. I think it is good to think and discuss, but to a limit. I feel that once you try to launch your system, your own thinking of what is important and what is much less important to be concerned about will change a lot. So, for now, I am going to skip responding to some of your arguments.

For some reason I've never adapted to forums. Part of it is the
notification thing (unless there's something that I can actually
*read* in my inbox I usually never get around to responding to it),
but my experience with forums has also been that they're far more
likely to harbor trolls and other kinds of people who actually don't
do anything but spout negative and ignorant comments. At least most of
the people hear seem to have *done* something constructive, even if
(like me) it's been to publish a design document.

But, I'm willing to explore this further: Are there forums covering
the same area as this mailing list that I should check out?

&gt;&gt;<i> Well, except by popular vote: You have to allow people to change their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system or we'll never get beyond the ones we have now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why should it be all or nothing? Some parts of the system can be fixed,
</I>&gt;<i> while most can still change according to the will of people. I see no reason
</I>&gt;<i> to allow this rule to change: a voter retains full control of his vote at
</I>&gt;<i> all times.
</I>
But you've got a Catch-22 here: How can they change the system to one
that enforces this without simultaneously allowing them to change the
new system too? Better to design the system to ensure that they
*don't* do this, not merely tell them that they can't. Consistency is
key in lawmaking, after all, and we're selling a new form of
government, not a new religion (where making hard &quot;god given&quot; rules
like this is standard practice).

&gt;&gt;<i> LOL! I again recommend Ariely's Predictably Irrational: People are subject
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to all kinds of manipulation techniques.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, people are somewhat reasonable. They prove it every day by managing
</I>&gt;<i> their own lives. I do not understand why you find it funny. You yourself
</I>&gt;<i> said that people should not be treated as kids.
</I>
LOL! Again! Half the people in the US living paycheck to paycheck with
zero savings to handle emergencies. IMHO that's almost always because
they've made bad *personal* monetary decisions. Now a lot of this is
is certainly just ignorance of basic financial practices (most people
can't even define &quot;compound interest&quot; or have any idea about why it's
important), but a lot of it also is that they've been exploited
(manipulated by advertising into making purchases of things they can't
afford, relying on predatory lending companies, etc.). True, people
shouldn't be treated as children (where even their most fervent wishes
can be overridden) but neither should they be considered to be
rational. Their decisionmaking capabilities need to be augmented as
much as possible via the design of the system. This includes providing
the information they need exactly when they need it, providing
information in an easily digestible form, countering their tendency to
defer to SDAPs, countering the Clinations they've decided need to be
deprecated (hopefully tribalism, but also things like heuristic and
moralistic thinking, etc.)

&gt;&gt;<i> This to me means ruling out virtual delegates and especially party-based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or special-interest-based proxies, both of which will routinely be used by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SDAPs to manipulate people, just as they do in our current systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that people have too little choice under the current system.
</I>&gt;<i> People should be given more choice, not less. Nothing bad will happen from
</I>&gt;<i> more choice. Do not treat people like kids.
</I>
I disagree with the &quot;nothing bad&quot; claim: Give them a little extra
control and you remove their incentive to insist on full control. This
is exactly the same problem with Avaaz and MoveOn and other
slacktivism organizations: IMHO they're actually *preventing* progress
by promising something they don't actually deliver and blunting
people's motivations to actually *do* something about the problems we
face.

&gt;&gt;<i> Bills/laws as currently produced are simply inappropriate for non-lawyers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to even try to understand
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is why in most cases people will rely on delegates (representatives).
</I>&gt;<i> But in some cases many people will&#160; want to vote directly (not every
</I>&gt;<i> important bill/issue is so cryptic ).
</I>
Unfortunately nearly all are, in my experience. Try running them
through a grade-level measure (like Flesch&#8211;Kincaid in MS Word). If we
really want to try a system like yours (and there are several other
systems like this out there) the first thing we should do is pass a
law that requires that all proposals come in below 12 (high-school
graduate) on that measure. This doesn't guarantee readability, but is
a minimum standard we should insist on.

&gt;&gt;<i> Only allowing already-elected people as delegates is unworkable
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could read on the site that this is only a first step. The next step
</I>&gt;<i> would to let regular users to become delegates. But even simply increasing
</I>&gt;<i> the choice of representatives, enabling them to be by sectors (issues) and
</I>&gt;<i> switchable at any time makes the system strictly better.
</I>
Agreed, modulo the blunting effect of a half-assed solution. IMHO
political change, like most technological change, is not an
incremental process. It must be disruptive to succeed.

&gt;&gt;<i> I no more trust Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren with my vote than I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz. This doesn't even take into account log
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rolling or other ways *all* of these elected officials game the system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Having the voting records of the representatives is no help
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then vote yourself or rely on your matchism engine. But please do not take
</I>&gt;<i> away my freedom of giving my vote to some people on some issues if and when
</I>&gt;<i> I choose to do so. I am not a kid.
</I>
But are you susceptible to fearmongering and other demagoguery? Even
if not, are you sure everyone else can resist them? Living in
civilization *requires* giving up some freedoms. IMHO, the freedom to
pile votes on a few celebrities is one of them.
