<PRE>One more thing I have forgotten. Matryoshka is system of levels, but do not be confused by that, the system may re-grow more organically or be scalar.

Hi,



overnight, the idea of stable intermediate forms inflated inside me quite significantly and here is the current intermediate form (result :D):



Leadership is the stable form. 

Consensus

is the most legitimate (including consensus on what should be united and what not).



Now imagine that Leadership is the smallest matryoshka that is full inside and is almost indestructible.

Consensus is the biggest one matryoshka.



Now, you would like to have the smaller 

matryoskas

when the biggest gets lost, still you would like to find the biggest again and give the others inside.





So, you would like to have a system that is working even when the most legitimate layer gets lost. But system that also prefers more

legitimate procedures







as soon as they become available.



In previous email there was two level system (just two matryoshkas). Inner representative Condorcet, outer direct majority rule.



What do you think?




Cheers

m.
