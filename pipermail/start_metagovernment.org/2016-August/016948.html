Very convenient if you sit there on the site all day. I know there are
a lot of people who do this, and do it for FB and/or Slashdot and/or a
bunch of other sites. I'm not one of those people and frankly wonder
about some of them (don't they have lives?)

&gt;&gt;<i> but my experience with forums has also been that they're far more

</I>&gt;<i> Check it, it is a forum with hundreds of millions visitors a month. But it

</I>&gt;<i> subforums you care about. Trolls are quickly eliminated by down-voting.
</I>
Or by blatant censorship of their posts. Check it out yourself: Any
topic that is even the least bit controversial will have as many
deleted posts (indeed entire subthreads) deleted as you're able to
actually see. Which is why sites like <A HREF="https://uneddit.com">https://uneddit.com</A> and
<A HREF="https://unreddit.com">https://unreddit.com</A> exist. While this doesn't mean that *our* little
group couldn't function on Reddit, it surely means that it's an
entirely inappropriate system for any sort of democratic process.

I hadn't looked at Reddit since last year, but see that's it's gotten
significantly worse in that time. I still do read Slashdot regularly,
though, and agree with the general concensus on Slashdot that there's
something seriously off about Reddit (of course not anything nearly as
bad as what they have to say about even more poorly regulated sites
like 4chan). But my main criticism of *all* of these sites is that
they're designed to attract eyeballs, not to facilitate mutual
understanding of a complex topic. The posts that get upvoted sometimes
contain some insight or useful information, but for the most part
they're merely clever trolls posting snappy one-sentence comebacks. I
don't find any of that interesting or useful, which is why I don't
believe this group should move, nor should we use any of these sites
as a model for how to built a discussion/rating system.

&gt;&gt;<i> But, I'm willing to explore this further: Are there forums covering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same area as this mailing list that I should check out?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are democracy, directdemocracy, liquiddemocracy subredits. But the
</I>&gt;<i> last two not very active. Yeah, that may be the problem. But nor do I find
</I>&gt;<i> this list extremely useful, unfortunately. There are several somewhat active
</I>&gt;<i> posters here, but my interest overlap with the list is maybe 1.5 people or
</I>&gt;<i> so.
</I>
&quot;Not very active&quot; is an understatement: There haven't been any posts
on most of those areas for months or even years! But I agree that this
list isn't much better. Which is why I asked if anyone knew of any
alternatives...

&gt;&gt;<i> But you've got a Catch-22 here: How can they change the system to one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that enforces this without simultaneously allowing them to change the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new system too?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You do not necessarily need to formally change the system. You can design a
</I>&gt;<i> system parallel to the Congress, convince people it properly represents
</I>&gt;<i> people, demand that representatives use it or vote them out. It is not a new
</I>&gt;<i> idea, see Placeavote for example.
</I>
Sure, this is a common idea. And I think completely bogus and
unworkable. When the revolution comes it will be a full replacement of
these &quot;elites&quot;, not some way to try to influence them into doing what
they're supposed do (i.e., &quot;represent&quot; us). If you think otherwise, I
submit that you don't really understand how our current systems work.

&gt;&gt;<i> LOL! Again! Half the people in the US living paycheck to paycheck with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> zero savings to handle emergencies. IMHO that's almost always because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they've made bad *personal* monetary decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Compare it to a country that accumulated a huge debt (about its GDP) and
</I>&gt;<i> without any emergency! Those people look quite reasonable in comparison.
</I>
Are we talking about Japan? Their debt ratio is several times higher
than even the USs. But I don't think any of that is a useful criticism
of neurotypical rationality as my claim is that the people that put
the government in debt (in *all* countries) simply aren't
neurotypical. Take the corruption out of politics (e.g., by getting
rid of misrepresentative democracy) and regular people will be able to
make far more rational decisions. Hopefully more rationally than even
they're able to do with their own personal finances (e.g., unlike
SDAPs that shiny new weapons system won't have anywhere near the same
appeal to them that a new HDTV does).

&gt;<i> This is actually very important. I could respond to the rest of your
</I>&gt;<i> arguments. They are thoughtful and well presented even though I do not fully
</I>&gt;<i> agree with many. But the prospect of spending lots of time just talking and
</I>&gt;<i> not much done bothers me. I have seen it a lot on this list. I think it is
</I>&gt;<i> good to think and discuss, but to a limit. I feel that once you try to
</I>&gt;<i> launch your system, your own thinking of what is important and what is much
</I>&gt;<i> less important to be concerned about will change a lot. So, for now, I am
</I>&gt;<i> going to skip responding to some of your arguments.
</I>
Understood. I'm not able to commit to any timeframe as yet, not only
because I don't know what burdens there will be on my time, but more
importantly because I'm not even sure *I* understand the environment
well enough yet to produce a successful product. Certainly it's much
more complicated environment than the last time I did this kind of
thing (creating a startup software company). But I know a lot more now
than I did then and it is also very familiar in a way and so I have
every confidence that eventually I will see the path forward and be
able to get to coding.
