&gt;<i> Hi Scott and Matteo,

</I>
It's getting worse: Just found this message in my Spam folder, along
with half a dozen other messages that shouldn't have been in there.
Don't know what Google is doing, but the spam filtering in Gmail,
which used to work really well, is now seriously broken.

&gt;<i> Matteo, I read you DD document. I especially like your emphasis on
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility of delegation and simplicity. I agree, this absolutely essential
</I>&gt;<i> if one hopes to get an average person involved into it. It is beyond me to
</I>&gt;<i> understand why most people involved in DD projects do not consider it
</I>&gt;<i> seriously or even strongly oppose it.
</I>
Again,it looks to me like a religious argument: They see that
representative democracy is broken and so are refusing to have
anything to do with anything that even *looks* like it. Throwing out
the baby with the bathwater, as they say. My position is that it's
merely the selection of representatives that's broken, not the base
concept that you can rely on others to do some of the heavy lifting
required to run a government.

&gt;<i> I know Scott wants to be careful about using virtual delegates. I am not
</I>&gt;<i> convinced it is a real problem. Scott, I will reply to your objections in a
</I>&gt;<i> different message later. But my basic arguments are 1) a voter retains full
</I>&gt;<i> control of his vote by design (this fundamental requirement cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> changed),
</I>
Well, except by popular vote: You have to allow people to change their
system or we'll never get beyond the ones we have now. The trick is to
design the system so that it doesn't fail in this way, not to count on
some theoretical backstop (which, as Hitler getting elected dictator
proved, isn't adequate protection).

&gt;<i> 2) people are somewhat reasonable.
</I>
LOL! I again recommend Ariely's Predictably Irrational: People are
subject to all kinds of manipulation techniques. Our goal must not be
to wave our hands and assume that they'll miraculously behave
reasonably when the going gets tough but instead to design the system
to *prevent* this sort of manipulation in the first place. This to me
means ruling out virtual delegates and especially party-based or
special-interest-based proxies, both of which will routinely be used
by SDAPs to manipulate people, just as they do in our current systems.
The only reason I can see to allow these sorts of proxies is
efficiency, and that's a very weak justification considering how
vulnerable these mechanisms are and how robust and efficient a
psychological-matching-based system will be.

&gt;<i> Having said this, I am open to considering extra safeguards, like Scott
</I>&gt;<i> proposed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Matteo, I have some questions for you. You wrote: The system would not
</I>&gt;<i> require any changes to the Constitution and not even require the creation of
</I>&gt;<i> a new political party (at least at the beginning). I agree that one should
</I>&gt;<i> not rely on constitutional changes, definitely not initially. But what
</I>&gt;<i> options do you consider that do not involve a party? Do you have ideas how
</I>&gt;<i> one could start? Do you know many people who share your views? Are there
</I>&gt;<i> online places where similar ideas are discussed?
</I>
I would like to know these things too. I have previously expressed my
strong reservations that a new system can be put into place without
some sort of revolution (though of course we would design it to be a
bloodless coup). Certainly expecting our current representatives to
just rubber stamp the output of some DD-based system is very naive:
Not only do the laws in many cases specifically prohibit this sort of
abdication of their responsibility, the current system is virtually
designed to ensure that we're electing exactly the wrong sorts of
people to do so (i.e., they didn't run for office to &quot;represent the
people&quot;, they did it to &quot;make a difference&quot; or for increased personal
power or whatever).

&gt;<i> By the way, I actually have a very basic prototype of my ideas, a website. I
</I>&gt;<i> would call it a half-serious half-toy project. It is somewhat serious
</I>&gt;<i> because it deals with US congressional laws, you can choose delegates, it
</I>&gt;<i> can be done by sectors. It has an essay describing my ideas. It is still a
</I>&gt;<i> toy project, because it is very basic and votes are counted after a vote in
</I>&gt;<i> Congress, as the delegates are the congressmen. Well, this is what I could
</I>&gt;<i> do on my own in about 2 weeks of total effort. I launched it 10 months ago.
</I>&gt;<i> My hope was that having a concrete,  albeit simple, prototype would help me
</I>&gt;<i> to find like-minded people. It proved harder than I expected. You are very
</I>&gt;<i> welcome to check it out at <A HREF="http://www.berepresented.org/">http://www.berepresented.org/</A>
</I>
Looks good, as far as it goes (and I agree that even getting as far as
you did in 2 weeks is pretty impressive: Web development is *hard*!)
But I must again express my belief that an &quot;overlay&quot; approach like
this is doomed to failure because it has too many serious design
flaws:

1) Bills/laws as currently produced are simply inappropriate for
non-lawyers to even try to understand (indeed IMHO it's actually worse
than that because most of the time even the lawyers voting on them
don't really understand them). It is therefore unreasonable to expect
a direct vote even on an issue that an individual has sufficient
information and motivation to participate in.

2) Bills/laws are currently produced by amateur social engineers.
Unfortunately the interactive-proposal systems frequently discussed
here on MG are even worse: They expect quality output from amateur
social engineers who aren't even decent writers let alone educated in
the law. I realize I'm setting a high bar here, but IMHO we need to
have social engineers before we can have laws that are anywhere near
optimal. As I've said before I actually consider this to be the
hardest part of the design of a new system and yet it is also the most
essential.

3) Only allowing already-elected people as delegates is unworkable:
None of those people are like me (or like you) or they wouldn't be in
that position in the first place (unless maybe you're already an
elected official ;-) I no more trust Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth
Warren with my vote than I would Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz. This doesn't
even take into account log rolling or other ways *all* of these
elected officials game the system.

4) Having the voting records of the representatives is no help because
of #1: If I can't understand the bills themselves, how can even hope
to find an appropriate proxy based on their votes on these things?

    Scott
