Good thinking ;-)

Seems a fairly week social engineering tool to me. Psychopaths don't
go into surgery because of the title, it's because they crave the
power (over life and death, patient's lives, etc.) and because their
miswired social skills are less of a handicap in that specialty.

I'm also questioning your premise: It seems you're trying to reduce
the problems that psychopaths cause in some fields by restricting
their access to those fields (or otherwise making some fields less
attractive to them). I don't see the problem with having psychopaths
in positions of power *provided* that there are regulatory tools that
the rest of us have to keep them from exploiting us: chain of command
in the military (including having *us* at the top), medical boards for
surgeons, capitalistic/competitive and shareholder constraints on CEOs
(and I would argue for education, which should not be run by the
government but instead by competing corporations). Indeed: If I've got
a brain tumor I might even *chose* a psychopath surgeon over a
neurotypical because I'd be assured of their full attention to the
matter (not because they give a crap about me personally, but because
I know that they know that their reputation (and power) depends on
them doing their best work on me). I'm probably weird like that,
though: Most people would probably choose a doctor with a great
bedside manner even if it means exposing themselves to a significantly
higher risk of dying...
