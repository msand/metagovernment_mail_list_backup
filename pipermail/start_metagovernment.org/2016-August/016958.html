Nothing wrong with being boring. The problems arise when you're
willing to allow other people (who may not be so boring) to be treated
differently.

&gt;<i> I told about my experience (as someone who uses reddit occasionally) to you
</I>&gt;<i> (who does not use reddit). My point was that your fears would not
</I>&gt;<i> materialize for a metagovernment-like discussion on reddit.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> But you can keep bringing arguments like &quot;first they came&quot;.
</I>
This is maybe a distraction, but I think my real motivation here is to
prevent a move to Reddit because that seems to me to require a
personal endorsement of censorship.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Is a revolution a part of your plan?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course! Isn't that why we're all here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not get it. In your optimistic scenario I did not see any revolution.
</I>
A &quot;revolution&quot; doesn't necessarily involve violence. It only requires
an abrupt change:
<A HREF="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/revolution">http://www.dictionary.com/browse/revolution</A>

A vote on a proposal to say that &quot;This is now the way we The People
make decisions&quot;, if the &quot;yes&quot; vote amounts to majority of the
population, would be a revolution.

&gt;&gt;<i> somewhere between a few years and a couple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of decades for it to become popular enough to consider a replacement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for our existing governments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Popular enough in what capacity? I am trying to understand if you expect it
</I>&gt;<i> to be applied to some binding voting before it is &quot;popular&quot; or proven to
</I>&gt;<i> work. Or do you expect people to use it in an idle mode, like voting on
</I>&gt;<i> non-binding internet resolutions?
</I>
See my previous post. Exactly how the system is described to the early
adopters is a marketing issue: It may be that enough people would fear
being called revolutionaries and so refuse to participate that to
achieve Critical Mass you'd have to soft-peddle, e.g., by calling the
votes &quot;non-binding&quot; or &quot;advisory&quot; or something. My sense is that most
people won't object to this portrayal as long as they feel it is safe
to do so by appealing to the Critical Mass requirement (i.e., by the
time it matters, the old form of government will already have been
replaced so it couldn't prosecute anyone for treason). Hence my use of
the &quot;beta test&quot; terminology: Everyone should know by now that you're
not supposed to pay for or make your company (or your life) dependent
on &quot;beta test&quot; software. Seems to me this might even add to the cach&#233;:
Most people, especially most young people, like to be a little bit
edgy or controversial, especially if there is very little real danger.
&quot;beta testing&quot; a revolution might really appeal to these people, and
of course the rest will follow along (bandwagon effect, peer pressure,
etc.) even when they don't actively participate (as is the case on all
other social media, where large minorities or in some cases even large
majorities, are exclusively consumers rather than producers).
