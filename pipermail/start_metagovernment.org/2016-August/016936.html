I'm sure a lot of people do, as they have probably since hierarchical
political systems developed. I'm also sure they're wrong ;-)

&gt;<i> I mean what do the majority of people want? A better life, better job? Ask them to be more specific and you lost them already. Some they could probably debate in vague lines on certain issues, again with no clear idea or resolution - just that they are not happy with it. Not only they don&#8217;t understand the complex socio-economic environment but most of them they don&#8217;t even want to actively participate &#8211; other than perhaps a lazy vote in most cases based on a superficial expression.
</I>
Spoken like a true SDAP: You can't trust the people because they're
poorly informed and/or too emotional and/or just don't have the right
priorities. This attitude is exactly what got us into this mess, and
in the EEA would probably get you killed as being more trouble than
you're worth: My claim in the Matchism manifesto is that people who
think like this (and exhibit other anti-social behavior) are actually
far more common in the general population now than they were in the
Pleistocene because they didn't survive very long back then.

I agree that everyone can't be an expert on everything, but if you
ignore the fact that people who want to make the rules/decisions are
psychologically different (i.e., they want different things) than the
rest of us, you're not ever going to solve these political problems
before some SDAP pushes the button that will end the species.

&gt;<i> I will go even further, if it were for the will of the people &#8211; we will be still living in trees, not even in caves, because it was the non-conformist mind, the bold, the explorers, who got us were we are now. We will stil be stuck in our &quot;primordial gut feeling&quot;, if it were not for these faulty/heretics :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Non-sequitur: The People have nothing against inventors or explorers
or even leaders even though most of them are not those things. They
*do* have a problem with these self-selected elites dictating how
things are going to be with no regard for what The People want. In the
EEA they could just opt out when these conflicts occurred (or, take
action to end the wannabe dictator, solving the problem permanently).
Unfortunately SDAP technology (i.e., armies wielded by kings, lords,
slave owners, misrepresentative government, etc.) makes that much more
difficult to do now. But the SDAP need the control of the
neurotypicals to keep them from recklessly starting wars or
discriminating against some segment of the population just as much as
the neurotypicals need them to explore/engineer/organize/operate the
systems we all rely on now.

&gt;<i> Now, that you mentioned brexit &#8211; they casted a vote without even questioning what is the plan once they get out, and how will that be better, not even bother to ask the basic questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed, it was a bad decision. But not because the decision was left
to The People, but because the people that made the initial proposal
did a half-assed job and the people that explained it to the people
essentially manipulated them into voting against their own interests.
But this is just a design flaw in the system the people were operating
in, and IMHO you therefore can't use it to reject the idea that The
People should get to make the decisions that are required to run a
government. We can use technology to reduce the incidence of bad
decisions like this, but, as with my gay-marriage example, sometimes
The People will lag the moral pioneers more than some of the pioneers
(probably including most of us) would like.

&gt;<i> A measurement of the will of the people will end in just something this &#8211; All I want is a better life. Sorry but that is what every living thing wants and how would that help say in trying to make a decision on a critical piece of infrastructure?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
How do you write &quot;you'll have a better life&quot; in a proposal that people
vote on? You can't, so your example is bogus. People will have to vote
on specific things, and again, they don't have to be experts on all
theses things, they just have to find people who would vote the same
way they would if they *were* experts. Misrepresentative government
doesn't work this way. At all.

&gt;<i> I do believe in democracy as a right of all people to participate in decision making directly or through representatives but that comes with a responsibility to be knowledgeable of what it takes. Is knowledge, research, passion and a lot of hard work that got us where we are not the &#8220;primordial&#8221; gut feeling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why are you here, then? Seems to me we already have exactly the system
you prefer...

&gt;<i> So, yeah, people want to be happy, have a decent job, nothing too hard if possible, maybe win the lottery, have few cans, watch movie or a match on the telly, basics. There are just a few who struggle and dedicate an important part of their lives to try to understand, learn, research and make things better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right, and your preference seems to be that we let these people make
the decisions for everyone. Why not wish for a benevolent dictator
while you're at it? That'd be even more efficient. And unfortunately
just as delusional.

    Scott
