Seems to me a bit of both...

&gt;<i> I would suggest two main ways to try to evalute a decsion:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) that it answerd most of the needs of the group members, with minimal
</I>&gt;<i> burden (high ROI).
</I>&gt;<i> 2) that it passed John Rawl's Veil of ignorance (a just decision).
</I>
Keeping mind that when you actually *do* the Veil of Ignorance
experiments Rawls proposed (but never actually did), the answers come
out very different from what he predicted: In particular the claim
that the advantages will naturally accrue primarily to the &quot;least of
us&quot; turn out to be wrong, and there are a great many deviations from
the utilitarianism Rawls' generally claimed to be a human
characteristic (as it turns out, utilitarianism is more commonly a
trait of psychopaths than neurotypicals). Both of these phenomena are
described in more detail in the Matchism manifesto, if you're
interested, but the short answer is that most of us are far more
tolerant of inequality than Rawls and other utilitarians would
prescribe. For me, that means only that the prescriptions were wrong,
not that there's anything wrong with the &quot;Veil of Ignorance&quot; as a
decisionmaking aid: I think it's great and ought to be included as an
option in any decisionmaking support package.

Speaking of which, this brings up another issue I'm currently
struggling with, the balance of power between Local and Global
control. Certainly most people are going to specify that they want the
majority of power to reside at the Locality level, but from a social
engineering perspective there are enormous problems with that
(corruption and the unequal natural distribution of resources being
the two biggest problems). I therefore conclude that this requires
that the majority of the control be at the Global level.

But for this to work properly we have to ensure that people will put
aside their personal biases when making policy decisions. Take, for
example, fracking (and of course putting aside the environmental
impact of carbon usage for now): If we leave it to local communities,
almost all of them will ban fracking, leading to inefficient
utilization of resources and most like serious economic problems (as
the result of global energy prices rising precipitously). But how do
you get the global community to act as if they were behind a veil of
ignorance (i.e., it could be *their* community they're voting to allow
fracking in) before voting on whether voting on whether to allow it
and if so what restrictions to put on it? Is this just a matter of
education, or should the concept of a Veil of Ignorance somehow built
into the voting system itself?
