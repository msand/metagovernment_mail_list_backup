Speaking from the engineering perspective, I don't think any of us
should be so delusional as to think that we're going to convince
anyone of anything based on our hopes/plans/dreams/scientific
explanations. The new systems will either work or they won't: There
will be no need for debate (or friendly audiences) to convince people
to jump on the bandwagon. If it works the success itself will be all
the marketing and justification you (we) will need. Which is why we
need to get it right and address any valid criticisms in the design
phase. IMHO at this point a hostile audience is actually a far more
useful thing to have, and something that I in particular can't get
enough of (e.g., to the extent I have received any criticism of the
stuff on matchism.org it's been only that it makes readers
uncomfortable, either because it's over their heads or merely because
it challenges their worldview. I have yet to receive a single claim
that anything on the site is inaccurate or illogical and to the extent
there is a criticism at all for the most part it's that it's just &quot;too
much&quot;).
  Regards,
    Scott
