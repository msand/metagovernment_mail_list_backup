As I've said before, I'm somewhat of a collector of techniques for
&quot;gaming the system&quot;. They're amazingly common, and once you start
looking for them you will develop a strong appreciation for how poor
our amateur social engineering has been to date. For example I'm
particularly fascinated by the Christian faith and the way the social
engineers who created it obsessed over the concept of &quot;forgiveness&quot;.
This seems to me to excuse (and therefore facilitate) all sorts of
antisocial behavior as long as you're willing to admit your
transgressions to someone (who is duty-bound to keep this information
secret) and maybe do some penance. Seems to me about the last thing
one would want to include in a moral/social system and certainly
incompatible with the social wiring that evolved in humans in the EEA
(the most important feature of which I would say is gossip, where
antisocial behavior becomes known to *all* your bandmates, enabling
them to protect themselves from being exploited).

&gt;<i> Or you consider yourself as exempt?
</I>
Not at all: My run-ins with psychopaths in my business dealings is
proof positive of that ;-) But forewarned is forearmed: What I find
useful in knowing about human behavior to prevent people (in general
and by specific individuals) from taking advantage of me personally is
also useful in formulating general social engineering rules. This
includes how to structure government.

The one exception might be my response to advertising, which I believe
to be completely (and often laughably) ineffective on me. I don't know
if this is innate or a result of my being raised by skeptics myself,
but it still boggles my mind as to why we even allow this sort of
manipulation to be used on people who apparently have little
resistance to it.
