Ah, I see it was, over 6 months later. Curious, though, that it
doesn't appear in the Science or Social Science citation indexes...

&gt;<i> I think it was mentioned in a post by Bryan Ford. Thanks for you references,
</I>&gt;<i> I will check them later.

</I>
Exactly: My points is that if you spend half the paper showing us the
basic math instead of on justifying the bindings between the model
parameters and the real world, you're being pretentious instead of
rigorous ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> The first bus-sized flaw in his model is the assumption that voters are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all rational
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To some extent, the voters are rational. But if you are going to be so picky
</I>&gt;<i> about approximations, you should use the same level of rigor in justifying
</I>&gt;<i> your approach.
</I>
But that's the point: By assuming The People are *not* rational, you
don't have to expect the math to work out. Of course it does mean that
you have to try to predict every way they might deviate from
rationality and either explicitly choose to ignore that problem or put
some sort of social engineering correction for it. These are actually
harder problems than throwing up a bunch of equations and working them
out, but IMHO vastly more likely to result in a working system.

&gt;&gt;<i> he also calls for a strong judiciary to override popular sentiment, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also consider offensive: We are not children and we can be trusted to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our own decisions without the interference of some sort of elite who's job
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is to protect us from ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not remember in what context he says it, probably in that we need to be
</I>&gt;<i> careful when experimenting (as the model is approximate). But his message is
</I>&gt;<i> very clear, to let people to decide for themselves. He would exactly agree
</I>&gt;<i> with your sentiment of people not being children.
</I>
Perhaps, but I didn't get that sense. His proposal was not just for a
safety net, but for a full-on override for The Will of the People when
it conflicts with The Will of the Elite. My &quot;safety net&quot; proposal
would be to make it a policy to break up major changes into smaller
(and presumably safer) pieces. E.g., you shouldn't vote directly to
eliminate all nuclear weapons, but could vote to approve a plan to
decommission the various systems in a particular order with revotes
before each phase.

&gt;&gt;<i> He's completely missed the point that aggregation of power *causes*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corruption: Paying people or even recognizing them for carrying a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> votes will only lead to them pandering or being preyed on by the special
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interests
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing forces people to give their votes to people who are preyed on by
</I>&gt;<i> special interests. Give it to your friend or vote yourself.
</I>
It's not force we have to worry about, it's manipulation. If you
haven't been following this Trump phenomena, for example, you're
missing a valuable learning experience: A system that even *allows*
demagogues or other single-issue leaders to acquire power is simply
bad social engineering. As per my previous message, this is not
treating people like children (I.e., preserving the ability to
override *any* of their choices), it's recognizing that their brains
are wired to perform well in the EEA and not in today's highly
technological world. This only requires technological solutions to
shore up these weaknesses, limiting the opportunities for SDAPs to use
them to manipulate The People.
