</I>Can you give a specific example how people might start using your system, the first 100-1000 users? Who will be writing proposals? What kind of proposals? What organization might use your system? Will the votes be binding from the very beginning?
I find description of your system (1-3) to be similar to what I have in mind or what Matteo was proposing. Except that I am willing to incorporate your matchism engine as an option, while you are insisting that it be only permitted mechanism of selecting proxies. But you still have not explain how you are going to start (see the above questions please). For me, it is a huge gap in your explanation. That people are naturally interested in politics and are naturally efficient may not be enough to expect them to be engaged in non-binding votings on some imaginary laws.

Again, I don't expect anyone to be convinced to dump a lot of work
into a project based handwaving about ideas. It lives or dies by the
quality of the prototype. And that I can build by myself, even taking
into account the horrible state of software development for the web: I
started my software engineering career writing device drivers in
assembly language, and the app I developed was bleeding edge on
X11/Unix before most people even had systems capable of running it
(i.e. it was years before even Windows 95 came out). Working in an
environment with primitive infrastructure support is something I'm
very familiar with and so is not much of a deterrent.

&gt;&gt;<i> The new systems will either work or they won't: There
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be no need for debate (or friendly audiences) to convince people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to jump on the bandwagon. If it works the success itself will be all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the marketing and justification you (we) will need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you describe your plans more specifically: how you are going to start,
</I>&gt;<i> how do you get initial users, what will they be doing at your site, what
</I>&gt;<i> will motivate them, what do you mean by success? Without these details our
</I>&gt;<i> discussion is a bit too abstract.
</I>
The basic design is laid out on matchism.org, but to clarify a few
(new) points of emphasis:
1) It's a voting system, not a deliberative system or a
consensus-building system. Nearly all of the proposals will be
produced by experts who know how to write for The People rather than
for other experts (or in the case of most of our laws, apparently not
for anyone). Eventually this may broaden to allow user-submitted
proposals, but IMHO that is not even an important feature, let alone a
necessary one.

2) My current thinking is to tie into social media and smart phones to
piggyback on their success (e.g., instead of just making a smart-assed
comment on Reddit or Twitter, you might actually use your phone to
*vote* on whether we should add some additional hurdles to immigration
policy).

3) A heavy-duty proxy-finding and utilization system: Most of the time
people's votes will come from the autopilot (i.e., computed using the
votes of their proxies). They'll then get a text or email specifying
how their proxies voted and why (i.e., when you cast a vote you'll
also be asked for a quote specifying *why* you voted that way), at
which point you'll have the option of letting that computed vote be
cast for you, or to override it.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have yet to receive a single claim that anything on the site is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inaccurate or illogical
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are myriad services that are internally consistent and logical and
</I>&gt;<i> that nobody uses. The most important question is why you think an average
</I>&gt;<i> person will want to use your site (before the success stage).
</I>
1) People are naturally interested in politics

2) People are naturally efficient in their resource allocation (i.e.,
they're &quot;lazy&quot;, or more properly, too busy to invest a lot of time in
something that will have no lasting effect). This is particularly true
of Neurotypicals because they don't crave power, unlike our current
SDAP leadership which is highly motivated by it.

Find a way to combine those two Clinations and the new system will
take off like FB and Twitter and the other popular social media
services that offer something that somehow managed to hit the sweet
spot in their niche. But I also believe a key factor in the success of
a new system is merely believing that it can be: People (as are common
on this list) who are afraid to use the word &quot;revolution&quot; or to use
their systems to make a decision about abortion or gun control IMHO
have merely guaranteed their own irrelevance.
