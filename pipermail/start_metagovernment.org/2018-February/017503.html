<PRE>Actually,

there is more to tell, happiness is not everything. There are more indexes
to watch e.g. years of potential life lost, natural resources depletion,
global climate risk index and also animal protection index.

Cheers

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to-intervene-in-a-system/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here are some tantalizing excerpts:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From: Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System  By Donella
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Meadows~
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to information).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There was this subdivision of identical houses, the story goes, except
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that for some reason the electric meter in some of the houses was installed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the basement and in others it was installed in the front hall, where the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> residents could see it constantly, going round faster or slower as they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used more or less electricity. With no other change, with identical prices,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> electricity consumption was 30 percent lower in the houses where the meter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was in the front hall.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We systems-heads love that story because it&#8217;s an example of a high
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leverage point in the information structure of the system. It&#8217;s not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parameter adjustment, not a strengthening or weakening of an existing loop.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It&#8217;s a NEW LOOP, delivering feedback to a place where it wasn&#8217;t going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A more recent example is the Toxic Release Inventory &#8212; the U.S.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government&#8217;s requirement, instituted in 1986, that every factory releasing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hazardous air pollutants report those emissions publicly every year.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Suddenly every community could find out precisely what was coming out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the smokestacks in town. There was no law against those emissions, no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fines, no determination of &#8220;safe&#8221; levels, just information. But by 1990
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emissions dropped 40 percent. They&#8217;ve continued to go down since, not so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much because of citizen outrage as because of corporate shame. One chemical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> company that found itself on the Top Ten Polluters list reduced its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emissions by 90 percent, just to &#8220;get off that list.&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Compelling feedback. Suppose taxpayers got to specify on their return
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forms what government services their tax payments must be spent on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Radical democracy!) Suppose any town or company that puts a water intake
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pipe in a river had to put it immediately DOWNSTREAM from its own outflow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pipe. Suppose any public or private official who made the decision to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invest in a nuclear power plant got the waste from that plant stored on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> his/her lawn. Suppose (this is an old one) the politicians who declare war
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were required to spend that war in the front lines.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The most stunning thing living systems and some social systems can do is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to change themselves utterly by creating whole new structures and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behaviors. In biological systems that power is called evolution. In human
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economies it&#8217;s called technical advance or social revolution. In systems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lingo it&#8217;s called self-organization.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Self-organization means changing any aspect of a system lower on this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list &#8212; adding completely new physical structures, such as brains or wings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or computers &#8212; adding new negative or positive loops, or new rules. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ability to self-organize is the strongest form of system resilience. A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system that can evolve can survive almost any change, by changing itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The human immune system has the power to develop new responses to (some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kinds of ) insults it has never before encountered. The human brain can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take in new information and pop out completely new thoughts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system &#8212; its goals,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structure, rules, delays, parameters &#8212; arises.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another of Jay Forrester&#8217;s famous systems sayings goes: it doesn&#8217;t matter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how the tax law of a country is written. There is a shared idea in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minds of the society about what a &#8220;fair&#8221; distribution of the tax load is.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Whatever the rules say, by fair means or foul, by complications, cheating,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exemptions or deductions, by constant sniping at the rules, actual tax
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> payments will push right up against the accepted idea of &#8220;fairness.&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The shared idea in the minds of society, the great big unstated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assumptions &#8212; unstated because unnecessary to state; everyone already knows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them &#8212; constitute that society&#8217;s paradigm, or deepest set of beliefs about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how the world works. There is a difference between nouns and verbs. Money
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> measures something real and has real meaning (therefore people who are paid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less are literally worth less). Growth is good. Nature is a stock of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resources to be converted to human purposes. Evolution stopped with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emergence of *Homo sapiens*. One can &#8220;own&#8221; land. Those are just a few of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the paradigmatic assumptions of our current culture, all of which have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> utterly dumfounded other cultures, who thought them not the least bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obvious.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The ancient Egyptians built pyramids because they believed in an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> afterlife. We build skyscrapers, because we believe that space in downtown
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cities is enormously valuable. (Except for blighted spaces, often near the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skyscrapers, which we believe are worthless.) Whether it was Copernicus and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kepler showing that the earth is not the center of the universe, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Einstein hypothesizing that matter and energy are interchangeable, or Adam
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Smith postulating that the selfish actions of individual players in markets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wonderfully accumulate to the common good, people who have managed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intervene in systems at the level of paradigm have hit a leverage point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that totally transforms systems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You could say paradigms are harder to change than anything else about a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system, and therefore this item should be lowest on the list, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second-to-highest. But there&#8217;s nothing physical or expensive or even slow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the process of paradigm change. In a single individual it can happen in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a millisecond. All it takes is a click in the mind, a falling of scales
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from eyes, a new way of seeing. Whole societies are another matter &#8212; they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resist challenges to their paradigm harder than they resist anything else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So how do you change paradigms? Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the great paradigm shifts of science,7
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/#seven">http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/#seven</A>&gt; has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a lot to say about that. In a nutshell, you keep pointing at the anomalies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and failures in the old paradigm, you keep coming yourself, and loudly and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with assurance from the new one, you insert people with the new paradigm in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> places of public visibility and power. You don&#8217;t waste time with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reactionaries; rather you work with active change agents and with the vast
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> middle ground of people who are open-minded.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Systems folks would say you change paradigms by modeling a system, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> takes you outside the system and forces you to see it whole. We say that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because our own paradigms have been changed that way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A Final Caution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Back from the sublime to the ridiculous, from enlightenment to caveats.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is so much that has to be said to qualify this list. It is tentative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and its order is slithery. There are exceptions to every item that can move
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it up or down the order of leverage. Having had the list percolating in my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subconscious for years has not transformed me into a Superwoman. The higher
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it &#8212; that&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why societies have to rub out truly enlightened beings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Magical leverage points are not easily accessible, even if we know where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they are and which direction to push on them. There are no cheap tickets to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mastery. You have to work hard at it, whether that means rigorously
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analyzing a system or rigorously casting off your own paradigms and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> throwing yourself into the humility of Not Knowing. In the end, it seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strategically, profoundly, madly letting go.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This helps a lot Michal. I imagine I'll be referring to this list for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some time to come. Particularly # 1.  (if you never hear from me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again...you&#8217;ll know why.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks so much,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Steve
