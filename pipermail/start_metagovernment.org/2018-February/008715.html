<PRE>Thank you a lot Steve,
as I see it now my explanation was too complicated, there are two terms
that may explain it all:

1. Sociology of happiness
2. Leverage points

I have a question for all. Please, are these two terms enough to understand
the concept? Please, does it say something to you? No, is an acceptable
answer :)

The old stuff about the leverage points ...

</I>&gt;<i> places-to-intervene-in-a-system/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are some tantalizing excerpts:
</I>&gt;<i> From: Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System  By Donella
</I>&gt;<i> Meadows~
</I>&gt;<i> 6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access
</I>&gt;<i> to information).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was this subdivision of identical houses, the story goes, except
</I>&gt;<i> that for some reason the electric meter in some of the houses was installed
</I>&gt;<i> in the basement and in others it was installed in the front hall, where the
</I>&gt;<i> residents could see it constantly, going round faster or slower as they
</I>&gt;<i> used more or less electricity. With no other change, with identical prices,
</I>&gt;<i> electricity consumption was 30 percent lower in the houses where the meter
</I>&gt;<i> was in the front hall.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We systems-heads love that story because it&#8217;s an example of a high
</I>&gt;<i> leverage point in the information structure of the system. It&#8217;s not a
</I>&gt;<i> parameter adjustment, not a strengthening or weakening of an existing loop.
</I>&gt;<i> It&#8217;s a NEW LOOP, delivering feedback to a place where it wasn&#8217;t going
</I>&gt;<i> before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A more recent example is the Toxic Release Inventory &#8212; the U.S.
</I>&gt;<i> government&#8217;s requirement, instituted in 1986, that every factory releasing
</I>&gt;<i> hazardous air pollutants report those emissions publicly every year.
</I>&gt;<i> Suddenly every community could find out precisely what was coming out of
</I>&gt;<i> the smokestacks in town. There was no law against those emissions, no
</I>&gt;<i> fines, no determination of &#8220;safe&#8221; levels, just information. But by 1990
</I>&gt;<i> emissions dropped 40 percent. They&#8217;ve continued to go down since, not so
</I>&gt;<i> much because of citizen outrage as because of corporate shame. One chemical
</I>&gt;<i> company that found itself on the Top Ten Polluters list reduced its
</I>&gt;<i> emissions by 90 percent, just to &#8220;get off that list.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Compelling feedback. Suppose taxpayers got to specify on their return
</I>&gt;<i> forms what government services their tax payments must be spent on.
</I>&gt;<i> (Radical democracy!) Suppose any town or company that puts a water intake
</I>&gt;<i> pipe in a river had to put it immediately DOWNSTREAM from its own outflow
</I>&gt;<i> pipe. Suppose any public or private official who made the decision to
</I>&gt;<i> invest in a nuclear power plant got the waste from that plant stored on
</I>&gt;<i> his/her lawn. Suppose (this is an old one) the politicians who declare war
</I>&gt;<i> were required to spend that war in the front lines.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most stunning thing living systems and some social systems can do is
</I>&gt;<i> to change themselves utterly by creating whole new structures and
</I>&gt;<i> behaviors. In biological systems that power is called evolution. In human
</I>&gt;<i> economies it&#8217;s called technical advance or social revolution. In systems
</I>&gt;<i> lingo it&#8217;s called self-organization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Self-organization means changing any aspect of a system lower on this list
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212; adding completely new physical structures, such as brains or wings or
</I>&gt;<i> computers &#8212; adding new negative or positive loops, or new rules. The
</I>&gt;<i> ability to self-organize is the strongest form of system resilience. A
</I>&gt;<i> system that can evolve can survive almost any change, by changing itself.
</I>&gt;<i> The human immune system has the power to develop new responses to (some
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of ) insults it has never before encountered. The human brain can
</I>&gt;<i> take in new information and pop out completely new thoughts.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system &#8212; its goals, structure,
</I>&gt;<i> rules, delays, parameters &#8212; arises.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another of Jay Forrester&#8217;s famous systems sayings goes: it doesn&#8217;t matter
</I>&gt;<i> how the tax law of a country is written. There is a shared idea in the
</I>&gt;<i> minds of the society about what a &#8220;fair&#8221; distribution of the tax load is.
</I>&gt;<i> Whatever the rules say, by fair means or foul, by complications, cheating,
</I>&gt;<i> exemptions or deductions, by constant sniping at the rules, actual tax
</I>&gt;<i> payments will push right up against the accepted idea of &#8220;fairness.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The shared idea in the minds of society, the great big unstated
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions &#8212; unstated because unnecessary to state; everyone already knows
</I>&gt;<i> them &#8212; constitute that society&#8217;s paradigm, or deepest set of beliefs about
</I>&gt;<i> how the world works. There is a difference between nouns and verbs. Money
</I>&gt;<i> measures something real and has real meaning (therefore people who are paid
</I>&gt;<i> less are literally worth less). Growth is good. Nature is a stock of
</I>&gt;<i> resources to be converted to human purposes. Evolution stopped with the
</I>&gt;<i> emergence of *Homo sapiens*. One can &#8220;own&#8221; land. Those are just a few of
</I>&gt;<i> the paradigmatic assumptions of our current culture, all of which have
</I>&gt;<i> utterly dumfounded other cultures, who thought them not the least bit
</I>&gt;<i> obvious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ancient Egyptians built pyramids because they believed in an
</I>&gt;<i> afterlife. We build skyscrapers, because we believe that space in downtown
</I>&gt;<i> cities is enormously valuable. (Except for blighted spaces, often near the
</I>&gt;<i> skyscrapers, which we believe are worthless.) Whether it was Copernicus and
</I>&gt;<i> Kepler showing that the earth is not the center of the universe, or
</I>&gt;<i> Einstein hypothesizing that matter and energy are interchangeable, or Adam
</I>&gt;<i> Smith postulating that the selfish actions of individual players in markets
</I>&gt;<i> wonderfully accumulate to the common good, people who have managed to
</I>&gt;<i> intervene in systems at the level of paradigm have hit a leverage point
</I>&gt;<i> that totally transforms systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could say paradigms are harder to change than anything else about a
</I>&gt;<i> system, and therefore this item should be lowest on the list, not
</I>&gt;<i> second-to-highest. But there&#8217;s nothing physical or expensive or even slow
</I>&gt;<i> in the process of paradigm change. In a single individual it can happen in
</I>&gt;<i> a millisecond. All it takes is a click in the mind, a falling of scales
</I>&gt;<i> from eyes, a new way of seeing. Whole societies are another matter &#8212; they
</I>&gt;<i> resist challenges to their paradigm harder than they resist anything else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So how do you change paradigms? Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book
</I>&gt;<i> about the great paradigm shifts of science,7
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/#seven">http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/#seven</A>&gt; has
</I>&gt;<i> a lot to say about that. In a nutshell, you keep pointing at the anomalies
</I>&gt;<i> and failures in the old paradigm, you keep coming yourself, and loudly and
</I>&gt;<i> with assurance from the new one, you insert people with the new paradigm in
</I>&gt;<i> places of public visibility and power. You don&#8217;t waste time with
</I>&gt;<i> reactionaries; rather you work with active change agents and with the vast
</I>&gt;<i> middle ground of people who are open-minded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Systems folks would say you change paradigms by modeling a system, which
</I>&gt;<i> takes you outside the system and forces you to see it whole. We say that
</I>&gt;<i> because our own paradigms have been changed that way.
</I>&gt;<i> A Final Caution
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Back from the sublime to the ridiculous, from enlightenment to caveats.
</I>&gt;<i> There is so much that has to be said to qualify this list. It is tentative
</I>&gt;<i> and its order is slithery. There are exceptions to every item that can move
</I>&gt;<i> it up or down the order of leverage. Having had the list percolating in my
</I>&gt;<i> subconscious for years has not transformed me into a Superwoman. The higher
</I>&gt;<i> the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it &#8212; that&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> why societies have to rub out truly enlightened beings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Magical leverage points are not easily accessible, even if we know where
</I>&gt;<i> they are and which direction to push on them. There are no cheap tickets to
</I>&gt;<i> mastery. You have to work hard at it, whether that means rigorously
</I>&gt;<i> analyzing a system or rigorously casting off your own paradigms and
</I>&gt;<i> throwing yourself into the humility of Not Knowing. In the end, it seems
</I>&gt;<i> that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with
</I>&gt;<i> strategically, profoundly, madly letting go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This helps a lot Michal. I imagine I'll be referring to this list for some
</I>&gt;<i> time to come. Particularly # 1.  (if you never hear from me again...you&#8217;ll
</I>&gt;<i> know why.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks so much,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steve
