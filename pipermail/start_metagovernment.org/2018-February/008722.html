<PRE>Hi Tim and all,

thank you very much for your interesting e-mail and the links, in
particular the overview on the tools.

I would like to take this as an opportunity to write to this group right
away an e-mail I wanted to post anyway as it directly refers to your
initiative.

Over the past ca. 10 years, I have been a more or less silent observer here
and was involved in a few bilateral and multilateral initiatives with group
members.

We are starting a big initiative at the moment (described below and almost
identical in the attachement in case you want to forward it to others) to
create a new internet tool for global debate, voting and elections.

The participation of metagovernment list members would be very much
appreciated and I am looking forward to hearing from old a new potential
partners.

Best regards,

Rasmus Tenbergen

Project Brief 01/2018



*An Internet Tool for Global Debate, Voting and Elections (GDVE-it) *



The World Parliament Experiment (WPE) and Democracy Without Borders (DWB)
are pleased to announce that they will be collaborating on the development
and promotion of an Internet Tool for Global Debate, Voting and Elections
(GDVE-it) and that they are seeking additional partners to imple-ment this
project.

GDVE-it is a practical bottom-up approach to promoting global democracy.
The internet platform will allow for a biometric registration as a world
citizen and the allocation of a unique world citizen&#8217;s ID. GDVE-it will be
a scalable and flexible platform ready to be used for different purposes.



*Initial subjects *

In a first step, registered world citizens will be able to vote on
resolutions considered at the UN Security Council. Making these resolutions
the subject of public voting is viewed as a symbolic counterbalance to the
unrepresentative and undemocratic nature of the UN&#8217;s most important body.
The goal is to achieve large public participation and to help build popular
momentum for a reform of the UN and to promote global democracy in general.
Other purposes of the platform may include to allow registered users to
endorse symbolic World Citizen Initiatives.



*Technical development and operation *

In close consultation with the project&#8217;s partners, WPE will be responsible
for the technical development and operation of GDVE-it as the successor of
an internet tool having been implemented in the year 2000. This &#8220;old&#8221; World
Parliament Experiment internet tool included functionalities and features
relevant to GDVE-it but needs a thorough technical upgrade. Also, some
important features will need to be added, e.g. for secure personal
identification. All functions and logical conjunctions will be rethought
and, where necessary, improved.



*Political advocacy and promotion *

DWB&#8217;s role will be to help coordinate all non-technical aspects of the
project. In particular, this concerns the creation and coordination of an
international network of experts and project partners as well as political
advocacy and public outreach. Generally, DWB supports GDVE-it as a sandbox
that allows to explore the feasibility and dynamics of global participation
and elections.



*About WPE and DWB *

WPE is a non-profit organization dedicated to making the idea of a
democratically elected parliament and other forms of global democracy
palpable: by events, campaigns and tools. DWB supports an even more
holistic approach to democracy promotion with a focus on global democracy.
One of its goals is the establishment of a UN Parliamentary Assembly as a
step towards a world parliament.



*The GDVE-it Network *

At present, WPE and DWB are building an informal network of experts and
institutions to support the development of GDVE-it. Membership is not tied
to formal responsibilities. Network members will

&#61623; receive frequent updates on the progress of the project and invitations
to project meetings and conferences,

&#61623; be invited to contribute ideas, concepts or code,

&#61623; be asked for their opinion and advice,

&#61623; support the project as they see fit &#8211; e.g. by research, articles,
statements, and networking.



*To build an excellent GDVE-it we need to bundle the global competencies in
this field. *

*You are kindly invited to become a member of the GDVE-it network (Google

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some here on this list may be familiar with ParticipateDB, the online
</I>&gt;<i> catalogue for digital engagement technology my consulting firm launched
</I>&gt;<i> back in 2009. Last year, we spun it out under a new entity, the Center for
</I>&gt;<i> Applied Community Engagement, LLC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are currently running the *ParticipateDB 2018 Digital Engagement
</I>&gt;<i> Census*, a global practitioner survey to find out which tools and
</I>&gt;<i> services people have been using in their community engagement and public
</I>&gt;<i> participation work lately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here&#8217;s the launch announcement from February 9:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.participatedb.com/2018/02/09/welcome-to-the-">http://blog.participatedb.com/2018/02/09/welcome-to-the-</A>
</I>&gt;<i> participatedb-2018-digital-engagement-census/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here&#8217;s yesterday&#8217;s update (we&#8217;ve extended the survey through February 26,
</I>&gt;<i> plus a first glimpse at the results):

</I>&gt;<i> And here&#8217;s the census main page with the link to the online survey form:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of you are involved in developing or promoting new/interesting
</I>&gt;<i> e-participation tools (for policy making, group decision making etc.).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would be great if you could take part or share with others in your network
</I>&gt;<i> who might have interesting stories/examples to report.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are particularly interested in hearing from non-English speaking
</I>&gt;<i> countries around the globe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any questions, just let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Tim
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: If you want to find out if your tool is already listed, check the list
</I>&gt;<i> of 350+ tools &lt;<A HREF="http://www.participatedb.com/tools">http://www.participatedb.com/tools</A>&gt; (we still would like
</I>&gt;<i> to hear about recent project examples, though). Thanks!
