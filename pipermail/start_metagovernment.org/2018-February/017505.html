Meh, it's just a rehash of the failed LiquidFB system. I've been
trying to explain to them exactly how LiquidFB failed and why their
system doesn't address any of the real problems in it (see the
&quot;Issues&quot; tab on <A HREF="https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper">https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper</A>), but to no
avail. They're quite skilled at marketing (getting funding, getting
conference invites etc.) but unfortunately seem to be almost
completely clueless when it comes to any of the scientific or
engineering issues that they'd need to deal with to create something
capable of replacing our existing systems. That and they're just
incorrigible fanboys of blockchain. It's like arguing with religious
fanatics. They really have no good explanation of why blockchain
technology is even relevant to the problem of public policy
decisionmaking, but, again, it's all about the marketing with those
guys.

Right: They don't know how to provide this but just have some vague
feeling that it's necessary. Which of course, as I've provided lots of
*scientific* evidence for in the Matchism manifesto and the help
system for proxyfor.me, is simply not true.
