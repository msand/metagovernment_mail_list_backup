<PRE>Hello Michele,

welcome to the Metagov-list! Good to get to talk to each other. Thanks 
to Matteo!

&gt;<i> In an important italian news paper blog i've heard about 
</I>&gt;<i> LiquidFeedBack... the article spoke well about LiquidFeedBack, but as 
</I>&gt;<i> i don't trust so much this news paper i want to ask you if you know 
</I>&gt;<i> something of this LiquidFeedBack.
</I>
I know it pretty well imo.

&gt;<i> I know both Votorola and LFB are used in Germany in the ambients of 
</I>&gt;<i> Piraten Partei, but you know what's the difference ? and why they are 
</I>&gt;<i> not unified in an only platform ? why LFB was prevailing ?
</I>
Votorola is not being used by the Pirates in Germany. They only use LFB 
(developed by themselves). Both are quite different.

In LFB the process of collaborative drafting of legislative drafts goes 
like this: one person (or initiative) is the author of such a draft and 
collects votes for it. If the voters want to suggest improvements they 
can do so. If the suggestion doesn't get accepted, the voter has to 
become an author himself, create a new (his own) draft and start 
collecting votes for himself now. He and the old author have no 
connection to each other anymore.

In Votorola every voter for a specific draft can simultaneously also be 
the author of his own version of the draft. He can collect votes for his 
version and delegate them further to his candidates version. This way 
many authors can all be interconnected. They can communicate and bargain 
about changes in each others drafts. The number of votes behind them 
influences their leverage in these bargains and in case the bargains 
don't work out, the voters can shift their votes to other versions all 
the time.

I tried to explain this in more detail here:
