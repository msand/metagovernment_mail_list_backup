<PRE>Hey C,

I like the idea of eating our own dogfood (tools).  In order to reply,
I first need to understand the problem you're chasing, and exactly how
it calls for tooling.  The GUEPO plan is currently executing in its
development phase [1], and you're contributing the track design for
q-sum accounts [2], a core component of the RAC.  What problem do we
have *there* that tooling could solve?  I understand how the tools
might help if: (a) we disagreed between us on the plan; or (b) a third
person wanted to contribute but was forestalled by a disagreement over
the plan; or (c) an entirely different plan called for your help (or
mine), but again there was a disagreement to clear up first.  In those
cases, the need is clear.

&gt;<i> To show the attraction of consensus based action ...
</I>
You want to attract a project such as OpenSourceEcology that depends,
like we do, on a consensual assignment of resources, and you plan to
showcase our RAC for this purpose.  We probably could do that if we
had a useful application to showcase, but &quot;useful&quot; brings us back to
the question of the need fulfilled by the tooling *in that
application*; we have to flush that need out into the open, first.

Sorry if it's obvious, and I just miss it.

 [3] What do we call that?  Political economy?

</I>&gt;<i> itself, making the external recognition of any law or initiative unnecessary 
</I>&gt;<i> for success.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore I will setup a plan to do drive development of this economical 
</I>&gt;<i> strategy. My first proposal for the plan (Economical Bootstrapping Plan, EBP) 
</I>&gt;<i> is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Priority list of our Votorola development:
</I>&gt;<i> * Create a good resource management Ui mockup
</I>&gt;<i> * Make resource management capable of driving (this) development
</I>&gt;<i> * Work together with Mike on GUEPO (2) to reach new developers and 
</I>&gt;<i> contributors
</I>&gt;<i> * Integration of Votorola with any other e-Democracy project on metagovernment 
</I>&gt;<i> if it participates in this effort.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will put 10 hours per week (in development) into this plan as a resource.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think? Under which conditions are you willing to contribute? I 
</I>&gt;<i> will draft it and help the process.
