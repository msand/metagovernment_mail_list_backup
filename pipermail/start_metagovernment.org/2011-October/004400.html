<PRE>&#160;
Hi Conseo,
thanks for your reply.
Agora 2.0 is still at the early stages of programming (if they have even started) and they are still discussion about how to set up the programming framework, etc.
As for really starting a collaboration in concrete terms between Votorola and Agora now, I think this may be too early as they have still to start on their platform.
I have repeatedly invited them to have a look at Votorola before starting, I am not sure they have done this, as they want to develop their own platform at the moment.&#160; 
As for my previous requests, I was just asking for a 2-3 page small document with some pictures of the main features of Votorola and few lines to explain not in detail at all. 
This would have been maybe 30 minutes of work or less for you, but as for me it would have required me&#160;to learn how the interface and the difference bridge works, which would have taken&#160;me much more time. 
(the videos made by Thomas were appreciated, but still they started to ask other questions about how Votorola works in detail for the amendment of laws, etc.)
I thought that this could be helpful for you as well, as you may be willing to invite other people to join in the future, but this does not have to be done now, maybe later on is OK, the decision is up to you.
In any case, this can be done later when you feel it is appropriated.
I do not want to make you lose any time, so please feel free to read quickly this and no obligation to reply.
As for my contribution, I am not a programmer so I am currently working with you, them, and other groups in order to make people talk together and avoid unneccessary duplications of work.&#160; 
This is taking quite some of my time.&#160; 
I am currently trying to help the guys of E2DI to set up a forum where to post the specifications of Votorola for what we know and keep the status of development updated.
I do not know if we will be able to do that, just trying.
This is how I am imaging my contribution. 
If you have any other ideas, you can contact me now, or in the future, I am available to listen even months from now.
&#160;
Matteo

Is code really all you can see? Do you have an account on the Pollwiki? Have 
you had a look into how the difference bridge works? Have you clicked around 
the interface, followed all the links and explored the Wiki behind it? Have 
you studied <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A> and followed the 
links, esp. the ones for the difference bridge?

The concepts are not intuitive atm. because they are new and have to be worked 
out. Please take your time to read about how Votorola works and don't ask 
generic questions like this. We all have little time and every minute (40 mins 
for this mail alone) I sit here to explain basic stuff again and again, I 
could improve it with the help of your insights to become self-explaining. I 
am happy with criticism and if you can't find something it is ok to ask, but 
please at least try to understand how it works, because otherwise we will fail 
in cooperation.

Our problem at the moment is not just some missing activists like you bridging 
different voting projects, but to find such an activist helping to build our 
tools which then help to bridge different projects of any kind by their 
design(!). So we need you, but atm. we need you and others as alpha testers to 
technically design the process of activism and mobilising people over many 
different forums and vote servers into a consensus. So to speak we need you 
reflecting on how the process itself will work out and what you will need to 
reach out to Agora 2.0 or any other project. (Think of it as a metalevel of 
activism.)
If we can reach out to Agora 2.0 with our tools, then we could spare all of 
this discussion we have done so far and fix our technical/conceptual 
limitations instead. Then we don't need promotion, they don't need to listen, 
we can simply inject the tools anywhere. We can use our tools and concepts 
virally on Facebook, Google+, Youtube, whatever you want, but please don't 
believe the buzz that a Facebook group will suddenly bring us the necessary 
people, if they then don't understand our prototyping effort. 
You could also then explain to the Agora 2.0 the concepts in Italian during 
the process to get more activists as alpha users, if you help us on the 
metalevel. As a starting point it might make sense to setup a poll about the 
cooperation between Agora 2.0 and Votorola and to communicate this process on 
Facebook. Come to #votorola on freenode when you get stuck.

I think we have the critical concepts together, but we have to prototype them 
and any contribution to this process is necessary. I am not sure how you 
imagined your contribution, but maybe this makes sense to you?
