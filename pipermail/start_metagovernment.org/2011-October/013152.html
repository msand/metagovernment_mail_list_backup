<PRE>Hmm,

I wouldn't dismiss the problem of vote buying so easily. It has a long 
sordid history in the US, and from what I've read about electioneering 
in India, it has become a serious problem in some locales.

</I>&gt;<i> As long as &quot;Form&quot; IS NOT &quot;Function&quot;, there is room for all kinds of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It should be noted that even if the authenticity, auditability, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anonymity challenges of online voting could be overcome, there's another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> critical obstacle. Some experts make principled opposition to internet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting and even absentee ballots because there's no way to guarantee whether
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people voting from home or from convenient locations would be free from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intrusive oversight, coercion, or bribery. A private voting booth is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considered the surest remedy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's another reason I try to be consistently clear that Indaba is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anonymous, and is not positioned as something that can solve all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems of building an online government. It's focused first of all on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> raising the quality of discursive tools and open problem solving.
