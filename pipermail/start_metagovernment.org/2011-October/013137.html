<PRE>And here is a coalition site for people interested in what I'm talking

&gt;<i> Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>      I've been working on this concept for years and it's time this thing
</I>&gt;<i> finally gets online. I have an excellent site layout sketched out on paper
</I>&gt;<i> and it's design will bypass a number of inherent issues. I'm currently
</I>&gt;<i> involved with an independent contract with my college to program the site,
</I>&gt;<i> but I've realized that the necessary databasing is just too much for one
</I>&gt;<i> person without extensive related experience to accomplish in the necessary
</I>&gt;<i> time frame for the support of the 99% movement to be funneled like it could.
</I>&gt;<i> This thing is ready to explode NOW, and I'm sending the word out to all of
</I>&gt;<i> you, and many others, to join forces and make it happen. Below I'm posting a
</I>&gt;<i> relatively brief write up of the site's intended capabilities, as well as
</I>&gt;<i> some direction in the way of moving forward from here the fastest. Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> potentially interested in joining this project should know that I am 100%
</I>&gt;<i> interested in working with you, and before anyone tries to take this idea
</I>&gt;<i> and coopt or cash it in should give me even one chance to explain why
</I>&gt;<i> cooperating with me is in your best interest, (I've been showing my idea for
</I>&gt;<i> an opt-in governance site to professors, programmers, programming
</I>&gt;<i> professors, peers, and random ordinary people, and I've worked out a LOT of
</I>&gt;<i> bugs. furthermore, this site is inherently inflammatory as it will bring
</I>&gt;<i> people face to face with their difficulties and differences of opinion. I've
</I>&gt;<i> studied NonViolent Communication as well as the Pedagogy of the Oppressed as
</I>&gt;<i> well as the political science of the capitalist machine. I may not be able
</I>&gt;<i> to program this on my own, but I am one hell of an addition to the team, and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not asking for much. I'll do it pro bono, just don't sell out to
</I>&gt;<i> corporate interests, otherwise the site will never attract the 99% anyways!)
</I>&gt;<i>         Anyone's welcome to contact me directly at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">Anthonydunn97202 at gmail.com.</A> I've done a lot more writing on this and have
</I>&gt;<i> numerous angles already written up and considered, but for now, until
</I>&gt;<i> someone's asking to hear more, here's the site's capabilities:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Site capabilities overview:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1)      Most crucially, WikiPeace will enable horizontal discussion to
</I>&gt;<i> occur about any problem of any scale. This will be accomplished with the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to scale one&#8217;s search to a desired size, (I.E. city scale, global
</I>&gt;<i> scale, even down to individual households, organizations, and/or
</I>&gt;<i> workplaces), and from there to determine what space of that scale, (I.E.
</I>&gt;<i> what city, household, etc). The most valuable input will be the most visible
</I>&gt;<i> by use of user ratings, as WikiPeace aspires to embody meritocracy as well
</I>&gt;<i> as complete transparency and horizontalism, (the abolishment of inequality
</I>&gt;<i> in decision making power).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The user selects what issues are relevant to them, then what strategies
</I>&gt;<i> make the most sense, and from there directly interface with the selected
</I>&gt;<i> strategy&#8217;s authoring organization, with the ability to see their calendar,
</I>&gt;<i> update events to their own user profile calendar, and even set text message
</I>&gt;<i> reminders for events. The site is designed to bridge the largest gaps in the
</I>&gt;<i> process of nonviolent social organizing. In this way not only do the best
</I>&gt;<i> ideas for the worst problems get the most attention, but each person is
</I>&gt;<i> connected directly with what matters to them. Additionally, organizations
</I>&gt;<i> and member are transparently rated in effectiveness as well as 'karma', (in
</I>&gt;<i> case anyone's effective but say, sexist)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2)      A &#8216;haves and wants&#8217; section enables individuals to find what they
</I>&gt;<i> need from people around them as if everyone interested was running a 24/7
</I>&gt;<i> yard sale. What&#8217;s more is that there will be space for people to
</I>&gt;<i> offer/request intangible goods, such as skills fermenting, or repairing
</I>&gt;<i> electronics. Because everything is transparent, using these classified ads
</I>&gt;<i> to do crime will become virtually impossible, such as the craigslist
</I>&gt;<i> killings. &#8211;Individuals will have space to barter if they choose, reducing
</I>&gt;<i> the amount of dependency upon &#8216;a-moral&#8217; corporations, corrupt governments,
</I>&gt;<i> and currency in general, to meet the needs of real people. -furthermore this
</I>&gt;<i> is invaluable because it makes users return to the site and tell their
</I>&gt;<i> friends.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3)      A critical factor in the resolution of today&#8217;s problems is that
</I>&gt;<i> there is an immense history of the ruling classes reframing the messages of
</I>&gt;<i> the oppressed in ways that makes change not happen. Propaganda has proven an
</I>&gt;<i> invaluable tool for the generation of a public that cannot hear its less
</I>&gt;<i> fortunate members, for the most valuable of terms have become the most
</I>&gt;<i> loaded. WikiPeace is designed to leave infinite space for its users to
</I>&gt;<i> debate cultural myths, as well as providing a space for the most universal
</I>&gt;<i> myths to be sorted out on global scales, with tremendous amounts of input
</I>&gt;<i> from all sides, and everything rated, (transparently).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4)      The default presentation of any page will be written in &#8216;common
</I>&gt;<i> speak&#8217;, as in the message will be phrased specifically so that the most
</I>&gt;<i> people can understand it. Each page will have a &#8216;side&#8217; one may choose to
</I>&gt;<i> display that is for technical vernacular, that WikiPeace may contain both
</I>&gt;<i> the specialized language of professionals, while not leaving &#8216;lay-people&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i> behind. Another side one may choose to read and/or write in is in the
</I>&gt;<i> language of Marshal Rosenberg&#8217;s NonViolent Communication, which is
</I>&gt;<i> specialized for the most effective conflict resolution. It is based on
</I>&gt;<i> stating needs, as well as circumventing inflammatory, counter-productive
</I>&gt;<i> language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5)      There is a system of &#8216;tokens&#8217; which allow users to do everything
</I>&gt;<i> from openly debate concepts without disrupting a page, to tracking a page to
</I>&gt;<i> be notified if it has been altered either slightly, or entirely. The
</I>&gt;<i> &#8216;tracking token&#8217; will ensure that site disruption is ineffective, as
</I>&gt;<i> complete transparency will enable users to flag disruptors and discontinue
</I>&gt;<i> their editing privileges, and important pages will be tracked by potentially
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of users. The &#8216;debate token&#8217; enables users to place anywhere in a
</I>&gt;<i> pages text essentially a link to the debate. This debate format is
</I>&gt;<i> transparent, and starts with a &#8216;for&#8217; and &#8216;against&#8217; section, where the users
</I>&gt;<i> rate the best arguments on either side to display at top. There will be
</I>&gt;<i> space for informational links, as well as a section for arguments that are
</I>&gt;<i> neither  for or against but somehow relevant. The &#8216;note token&#8217; is similar
</I>&gt;<i> to the debate token, except its meant as a gentle addendum to a pages text,
</I>&gt;<i> usually transitional, because either the addendum should be written into the
</I>&gt;<i> page, or it&#8217;s on its way to becoming a debate. Sometimes it is a tangent and
</I>&gt;<i> in this way information can flourish separately from the realm of
</I>&gt;<i> distraction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6)      There will also be a map generator which can display the
</I>&gt;<i> popularity of one issue's strategy over another in relation to its rater&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> general geographic location. In this way, it will be demonstrated that a
</I>&gt;<i> &#8216;law&#8217; doesn&#8217;t need to be something everyone in an arbitrary, legal, division
</I>&gt;<i> of land has to do battle over. Where ever and however a consensus decides
</I>&gt;<i> they want their rules/boundaries can be the very skeleton of a law,
</I>&gt;<i> determining it&#8217;s geography based on how actual people feel about what should
</I>&gt;<i> be done. I know it sounds potentially confusing, but what we've got running
</I>&gt;<i> now is outright criminal, requiring 'laypeople' to abide by a code that is
</I>&gt;<i> so complicated it literally requires specialists to interpret.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In summary, these features combined will make participation and learning
</I>&gt;<i> streamlined, specifically for the purpose of implementing civic intelligence
</I>&gt;<i> to overcome the greatest threat our species has ever known, what can only
</I>&gt;<i> best be described as global corporatocracy, or the profit agenda. Once this
</I>&gt;<i> site is up it can enable everyday people to make actual change by not only
</I>&gt;<i> effortlessly connecting them to likeminded people, but by creating an
</I>&gt;<i> abundance of necessary information, and by helping all collaborators to
</I>&gt;<i> organize via interest-based education and text message reminders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ***I have a lot more ideas than this, but that's 'WikiPeace' in a nutshell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
</I>&gt;<i> Anthony Brasher
