<PRE>Dear Nillus,

I'm a software engineer for one of the projects mentioned by Ed.
Unfortunately, I know of nothing that could handle your requirements
off shelf, which I guess are: (a) consensus making; (b) free choice
and free expression; and (c) scale.  At best you could run trials of
experimental tools at small scales.  The tools wouldn't be much
immediate help though in furthering any particular political or social
issue; rather the opposite, as your efforts would aid in the
development of a general purpose technology that is still immature.

There is also theory.  Tools are designed to solve problems of course,
and the underlying theory often concerns itself with problems as much
as with solutions.  Likewise for the occupy movement, where a shared
recognition and understanding of the social problems is probably a
prerequisite for any kind of effective action.  Theory and practice
must go hand in hand, of course, but where the one is lagging the
other may sometimes take the lead.

This are just my own thoughts.  I'd be happy to answer any questions
you may have.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First off, I really appreciate what you've done with the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagovernment project. I've read through the Wiki Map, and I'm very  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impressed by its content. Thank you for your hard work on this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Have you been following the Occupy Wall Street protests? These  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; movements are leaderless democracies. Occupy Orlando is currently  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operating as a Consensus Government, but--as we grow in number, I  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think we'll find software facilitation of our General Assembly  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meetings hugely beneficial. I was researching the list of active  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects published on the Metagovernment wiki, but I was wondering  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you could help me with your experience in these matters.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you have a recommendation on a FOSS project that would help run a  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Consensus Democracy for the Occupy Orlando demonstration? Ideally,  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we need something that's user friendly, customizable, and scalable  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from a small committee of 3 people to GAs with tens of thousands of  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nillus
