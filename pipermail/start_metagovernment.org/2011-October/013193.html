<PRE>Dear Stephen,

&gt;<i> I imagine a short video outreaching to that community, clearly
</I>&gt;<i> describing your vision(s) of &quot;collaborative, consensus-based, and
</I>&gt;<i> synthesis-oriented solutions&quot;, would put Metagov at the creative hub
</I>&gt;<i> of a self-organizing mass of passionate, committed, and focussed
</I>&gt;<i> individuals.
</I>
That's a lot to expect from a video!  I wonder too if any organized
project could play a central role in this movement?

I have two ideas on how to connect.  First, we could enter at the
periphery by technical means.  It would require two things: 1) an
issue folks are hoping to agree on, and 2) online discussion centered
on that issue.  We don't need lots of people talking, just 2 or 3
core.  We'd use discussion refit to show them how to keep the process
free and open, and avoid a forced consensus:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Discussion_refit">http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Discussion_refit</A>

Second, we could offer ideas.  What they're lacking here is a common
cause.  They can point to lots of problems in society, but can't put a
finger on the exact cause of all those problems.  Here's a
possibility, something they themselves could correct (with a little
technical help): <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/autonomy/a/fau/fau.xht">http://zelea.com/project/autonomy/a/fau/fau.xht</A>

Do those make sense?  What else do they lack that we could offer?
