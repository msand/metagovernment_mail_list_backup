<PRE>Ed, et all,

My sense is the world is on the cusp of rapid and comprehensive change. I believe the work you are doing will be critical to the development of the next iteration of our species orientation, or evolution if you will. I think that upgrading your profile with a &quot;promotion&quot; of some sort is timely and critical for the widespread adoption of the tools you are creating. It seems to me the time for dithering is over. I would be wondering &quot;How can we go viral&quot; in order to say something like.....

Time and again we've experienced the inability of our chosen representatives to realize the outcomes they were elected to secure for us. There's a growing resolve for change that is becoming more difficult to deny and deflect through the all-to-familiar routines of spin and parry. For whatever reason, the existing system has foundered and is incapable of sustaining the needs of ordinary men and women, let alone the yearnings of the whole of life itself. The vested interests are now so dominant and entrenched that the only way to bring about a civil and compassionate society is to organize and empower an entirely new way. The moment is upon us.  Active cultivation of a truly equitable, conscious, and global collaboration is the only feasible option open to us at this point. The tools and the temper requisite to establish an alternative means of governing ourselves are very much alive and growing daily. It is now up to us to generate some new system of caring for the common body of this magnificent world. Metagov is creating a collaborative, consensus-based, and synthesis-oriented template in order to facilitate the changes that are currently upon us. This is how you can work with us....
As together we choose, together it will be.


I love what you guys are doing. I'm not a programmer but I would like to help in some way.
I will stay tuned....thanks so much!
Steve

</I>&gt;<i> I have included much of Michael's critique, in brief form. Please feel free to work on this with me, anyone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a bit of a conflict of purpose here. To be brief, I have focused on Michael's core argument that modern democracies are not liberating. However, that excludes a lot of the other valid criticisms of representative democracy at:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks very much for your kind comment; also for the offer of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wiki.  I debated with myself, and figured it'd be easier to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> critical feedback and maybe publish if retained authorship, control of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drafts, and so forth.  So I decided to draft it here, in this repo:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just posted a first draft of one section to EM, for comment:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree, the tie situation is an aberration in many regards.  It can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hardly touch the main argument, and even underlines it in ways.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I fear I would not live long enough to see an election in which my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vote affected the outcome, or anything else in this world.  Yet every
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> day I am affected by the decisions of those in power, and every day I

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are in the same situation as I, each affected by administrative powers
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and laws over which he (or she) has no comparable influence.  It was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not supposed to be this way.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Another point concerning ties: the fact that decisions are sometimes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decided by a single vote is not really an argument in favor of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system. It means that sweeping power was given to one person in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> midst of a strongly divided populace. It is the true 50%+1 tyranny of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the majority. Or much more often, it is really the tyranny of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> minority, since 1. often there are more than just two candidates and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. rarely do even half the people vote.
