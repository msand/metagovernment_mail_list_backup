<PRE>Hi C,

It occurs to me that the center photo in your latest mockups is more a
part of the votespace design than the track stack.  When a stack is
deployed in the difference bridge and other non-theatre pages, there
won't be a center photo.  <A HREF="http://whiletaker.homeip.net/mockups/3/">http://whiletaker.homeip.net/mockups/3/</A>

So I think it factors out of the track design effort, as something
separate.  It's a great idea, and I hope we can iron out the problems.
(It now occurs to me that overlap of higher voter circles as we climb
the tree is the #1 problem.)

Anyway, I think you're right to focus on this:

&gt;<i> My main concern atm. is how to react to a click on a TrackStack
</I>&gt;<i> segment.
</I>
When a segment is clicked, it'll most likely be the same as clicking a
node in votespace.  Otherwise it's going to be weird that the two
visuals (track and votespace) are disconnected.  By the same token,
when a node is clicked, it'll be the same as clicking a segment.

So it looks like you must climb the tree, showing segments of the
higher voter circles.  How to reconcile this with the progress
indicator is something of a problem, because the higher circles will
have much less resource volume = much less apparent progress.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3.ns.xht shows a node selection. Now the TrackStack shows up. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Heads-Up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; information is also shown.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wouldn't it make sense, to also highlight Dm. in yellow here? This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relates to your question below too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3.ns.m1.xht Hovering over the TrackStack changes the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; heads-up-display and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; highlights the relevant information in Votespace. It also changes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the visual in the centre.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I find this perfect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have moved the avatar/visuals in the &quot;collective eye&quot; in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; centre. I have had them in the top left corner of the heads-up display 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; before. What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like, how this way the individual gets the place he/she deserves:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the center!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there anything else, which would be equally important to put
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there? I never pictured it like this before, but I think this is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; best!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; What should happen when you click the yellow segment? If we select 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the node
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; like in Votespace then we duplicate the functionality and lose the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; left-click.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Connected to this question is also: does the current track change if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you click D3. in votespace? It would make sense somehow, right?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it does. 3.xht shows only the poll, so no TrackStack, but once you 
</I>&gt;<i> select a candidate anywhere, the TrackStack will show the goal (can be 
</I>&gt;<i> inherited from endcandidate or inbetween) and the segments behind that 
</I>&gt;<i> position.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because now only the immidiate voters of Dm. are shown in the track,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arn't they? If we also would show the indirect voters, the track 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get to cluttered at some point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But then: if the scale of the track
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stays the same it makes no sense, but what other scale could we take?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Make it a full 100%? That would be ok, if its always only the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; end-candidate who determines the necesarry goal, right? But is he?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, accounts can be defined anywhere and if the pledges match an 
</I>&gt;<i> account with the same name in one of the candidates, then it gets 
</I>&gt;<i> pledged there. The name of the account ensures that vote shifts keep it 
</I>&gt;<i> compatible. So goals can differ (you could set a lower goal for you 
</I>&gt;<i> individual and vote for sbd. with a much higher goal). Have I understood 
</I>&gt;<i> you correctly?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My main concern atm. is how to react to a click on a TrackStack 
</I>&gt;<i> segment.
