</I>&gt;<i> development of a general purpose technology that is still immature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I am another developer of one of the projects here. I agree with Mike, but I 
would like to add that we are working on the tools a lot since years now and 
that they are meant to be useful for activists. We are very open minded on 
metagovernment and we know nothing better, not even non-free software. If you 
come across something, which fits your needs, tell us! This software more than 
any else needs to be driven by its users.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello, Nillus, and thank you for the kind words. Of course, as with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Occupy movement, Metagovernment is a group effort and I am just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one member. It looks like there are a lot of opportunities for our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; groups to work together.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Governance tools are still very young, but I think we will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pair you with something that will work. I can make some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recommendations, but it would be much better to ask the entire group.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The programmers and members of the active projects are on our list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server, and they could better make recommendations than I could from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my position.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am cc'ing your message to the list server. People are likely to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; include you in their replies, but regardless, I'd suggest signing up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the list to get a better handle on the conversartion:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks again, and thanks for your work on Occupy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope today's occupation went well.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; First off, I really appreciate what you've done with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Metagovernment project. I've read through the Wiki Map, and I'm very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; impressed by its content. Thank you for your hard work on this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Have you been following the Occupy Wall Street protests? These
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; movements are leaderless democracies. Occupy Orlando is currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; operating as a Consensus Government, but--as we grow in number, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; think we'll find software facilitation of our General Assembly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; meetings hugely beneficial. I was researching the list of active
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; projects published on the Metagovernment wiki, but I was wondering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if you could help me with your experience in these matters.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Do you have a recommendation on a FOSS project that would help run a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Consensus Democracy for the Occupy Orlando demonstration? Ideally,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; we need something that's user friendly, customizable, and scalable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; from a small committee of 3 people to GAs with tens of thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; people.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thank you,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Nillus
