<PRE>Dear all,

Something newish looking I stumbled on is the
Dynamic Democracy Initiative: <A HREF="http://upgradedemocracy.org/">http://upgradedemocracy.org/</A>

  ... a collection of people and teams who realized that we aren&#8217;t the
  only ones thinking about and working on this vision of a Dynamic
  Democracy.

It's founded by Micah Daigle, San Francisco area:
<A HREF="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/micah-daigle/8/748/4b">http://www.linkedin.com/pub/micah-daigle/8/748/4b</A>
It lists Hyperarchy as a &quot;related project&quot;. *  I discovered it via a
cryptic, cross-post to Liberationtech (attached).

In a meeting a couple days ago, proxy voting was discussed:
<A HREF="http://forum.contactcon.com/discussion/23/upgrading-democracy">http://forum.contactcon.com/discussion/23/upgrading-democracy</A>

Does anyone know more about this Dynamic Democracy Initiative?  I'm
guessing it's purely an entrepreneurial/venture thing.


  * Hyperarchy is/was a venture in search of seed funding:

Subject: [liberationtech] Fwd: [CONTACTCON] The four selected ideas

Hi All,

Sorry for the mass mailing but I wonder if any of you (bcc'd) groups
would be interested in these projects(or proposing your own - see last
paragraph), which have now recieved a bit of funding at ContactCon and
I hope lots of attention, even just so you can criticise them or say
you are making one already ;)

Thanks,

Ale

Subject: [CONTACTCON] The four selected ideas
Date: Fri, 21 Oct 2011 09:42:23 -0400

I'm trying to locate and then publicize the online &quot;location&quot; of each
of the four ideas we selected at the end of the day. Exactly where
should people go to join up or support your projects?

The four that ended up with final meetings were:

1. Democracy platform for OWS and beyond.

2. Collaboration/Finder/Matching app for artists.

3. Local food sharing application/platform

4. KickStopper crowd-sourced un-funding

Whoever is the reporter for each of these meetings, please post here
the online forum/listserv/GoogleGroup or whatever you decided to use
to continue your collaboration. The <A HREF="http://forum.contactcon.com">http://forum.contactcon.com</A> is a
fine place for you to do this as well, but it seems to be less useful
or beckoning to people than I had imagined, as only about 5% of groups
posted their results to it during the day (given how much was going
on, I can see why &quot;reporting&quot; may have felt like overkill.)

Still, if you want the support of this community, of potential
funders, and of the world at large, the time to let us know of your
existence - of how we can send money, people, support, and more - has
come.

Show yourselves as soon as possible.  I will then write an email at
the end of today compiling this information, and send it to everyone.

Thanks for coming and supporting one another. What happened was real,
and can continue to be so.
