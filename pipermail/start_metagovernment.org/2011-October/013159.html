Hi Matteo,

</I>&gt;<i> any time, thanks.
</I>In Thomas' screencasts you can see the current Ui for voting as well as the 
concept of the Pollwiki. I guess you have followed our efforts already, but if 
you want to see our current Ui prototype in parts working, have a look here:

We are still prototyping this from the Ui perspective to make pledging and 
resource management/Crossforum extent a self-exploring experience. If the 
Agora people have their own ideas and concepts, now would be the right time to 
join the Votorola list and help to discuss the mockups. That way we could get 
to know each other on the way and then they can decide whether Votorola fits 
their perspective or not. It is all written in Java, except for the configs in 
JavaScript and the MediaWiki extension in PHP. The web ui is written in Java 
with GWT. Maybe this helps? If they are really interested they should join the 
votorola mailing list to clear any questions.
