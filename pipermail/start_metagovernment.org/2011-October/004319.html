<PRE>Hi Ed,

Thanks very much for your kind comment; also for the offer of the
wiki.  I debated with myself, and figured it'd be easier to get
critical feedback and maybe publish if retained authorship, control of
drafts, and so forth.  So I decided to draft it here, in this repo:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/var/db/repo/autonomy/log/tip/autonomy/a/fau/fau.xht">http://zelea.com/var/db/repo/autonomy/log/tip/autonomy/a/fau/fau.xht</A>

I just posted a first draft of one section to EM, for comment:
<A HREF="http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2011-October/thread.html#28556">http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2011-October/thread.html#28556</A>

I agree, the tie situation is an aberration in many regards.  It can
hardly touch the main argument, and even underlines it in ways.

</I>&gt;<i> 2. rarely do even half the people vote.
