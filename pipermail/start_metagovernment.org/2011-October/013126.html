<PRE>My question related to something else, to the assertion that it'll be
helpful to showcase the usefulness of the tools.  I asked, &quot;How can
the tools be useful to us?&quot;

It seems you answer, &quot;They'll be useful in helping to showcase the
usefulness of the tools.&quot;

But that would be circular.  If the tools aren't *immediately* useful
to us (the alpha dogs) in our own work, then we have nothing to
showcase.  We won't gain what you call &quot;first hand experience if the
tools really cut it&quot;, but only an empty show.  So I suggest we look at
the immediate utility of the tools for our own work, and ask what
exactly that is.

&gt;<i> &gt;  [3] What do we call that?  Political economy?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What was this reference about?
</I>
I forgot to add it to the phrase &quot;consensual assignment of resources&quot;,
it should have referenced [3].

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like the idea of eating our own dogfood (tools).  In order to reply,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I first need to understand the problem you're chasing, and exactly how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it calls for tooling.  The GUEPO plan is currently executing in its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development phase [1], and you're contributing the track design for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; q-sum accounts [2], a core component of the RAC.  What problem do we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have *there* that tooling could solve?  I understand how the tools
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might help if: (a) we disagreed between us on the plan; or (b) a third
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; person wanted to contribute but was forestalled by a disagreement over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the plan; or (c) an entirely different plan called for your help (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mine), but again there was a disagreement to clear up first.  In those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cases, the need is clear.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; To show the attraction of consensus based action ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You want to attract a project such as OpenSourceEcology that depends,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like we do, on a consensual assignment of resources, and you plan to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; showcase our RAC for this purpose.  We probably could do that if we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; had a useful application to showcase, but &quot;useful&quot; brings us back to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the question of the need fulfilled by the tooling *in that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application*; we have to flush that need out into the open, first.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry if it's obvious, and I just miss it.
</I>&gt;<i> It is not necessarily OpenSourceEcology. It is only their level of openness 
</I>&gt;<i> which would make them a good fit for open resource management and organizing 
</I>&gt;<i> efforts over several projects. 
</I>&gt;<i> The plan is to prove our openness and to see how people react when they 
</I>&gt;<i> approach us and we point them to the plans and tell them to join and improve 
</I>&gt;<i> them. It will also give us first hand experience if the tools really cut it. 
</I>&gt;<i> As Thomas has said it, we are interested in new contributors and it will be 
</I>&gt;<i> more in the future likely, so it would also be nice to have some historical 
</I>&gt;<i> data in the Wiki. The prize is not really attractive and I don't think it will 
</I>&gt;<i> be before something great happens with our work. We also don't need the 
</I>&gt;<i> Crossforum functionality yet, we can use the properties in the Wiki to define 
</I>&gt;<i> some labour or commitment. If we need to adjust them than we can do it from 
</I>&gt;<i> inside the planning. I would like to try this under G/p/ebp?
