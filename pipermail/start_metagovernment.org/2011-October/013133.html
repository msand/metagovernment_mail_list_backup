<PRE>
I am available every day from early morning your time until about 12:00 noon (+7 hours as I live in Japan)
You have my Skype, so we can chat.
There may be some delay from my side since I am also working in parallel.

Regards,&#160; Matteo

    Hi Matteo,

      

      that sounds good!

      How about, if we do this in a skype-talk?

      

      Thomas

              Hi all,
              I have been in contact in the last two weeks with the
                guys of Agora 2.0.
              The group of Agora 2.0 is now made up by about 40
                people with about 5 people in control of the main issues
                and project plan and other 35 people helping and
                volunteering.
              <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/p/agora20/home/Home/">http://sourceforge.net/p/agora20/home/Home/</A>
              <A HREF="http://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/agora20">http://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/agora20</A>
              They have dropped down some basic specifications of
                the system they want to use and they are starting to
                planning the programming part.
              I have asked them multiple times to consider to adapt
                Votorola to their needs, so that they will be able to
                save time and money in the programming part.
              I believe that the main ideas brought forward by the
                Agora 2.0 group (consensus participation, creaation and
                writing of laws by consensual participation and
                amendment) are quite similar that those of Votorola 2.0.
              As you can read in newspapers, this may be a good
                moment in Italian politics to get people involved, as
                there are many people looking for real change.
              The group of Agora 2.0 is interested in considering
                using other systems, unfortunately I have not been able
                to help them understand so well the details of Votorola
                and the current status of completion.
              I believe there is a great potential for both sides
                in a collaboration between the Agora 2.0 group and the
                Votorola group.
              There may well be benefits from both sides (win-win
                situation).
              &#160;
              Would it be possible for Thomas, Mike or Conseo to
                contact me and give me a more detailed explanation of
                the current status of the application and more details
                about the current implementation? 
              I need to have more knowledge if I need to brief the
                Agora 2.0 people.
              As I also tried to stress in the past, I believe a
                simpler and no-frills system may be better accepted by
                Agora 2.0.
              Not many supplementary and complementary
                funtionalities, just the basics to make the system work.
              &#160;
              Regards,
              Matteo
