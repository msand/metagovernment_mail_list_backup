<PRE>We have talked about creating a formal organization for  
Metagovernment. This would allow us to apply for grants, which in turn  
would enable us to:
1. Fund our own software development
2. Fund member projects as we see fit
3. Fund publicity projects such as the movie
4. Fund staff who could work full-time promoting the interests of  
Metagov

If we wish to organize, the first step for that would be to draft a  
charter (or bylaws or articles of incorporation) which defines our  
rules of operation.

At Michael's suggestion, instead of drafting some complex document in  
a wiki or inside one of our voting tools, I am starting out with the  
simplest statement I can in this e-mail. As the conversation  
progresses, we can move it to a more appropriate forum as we see fit  
(perhaps Vilfredo to start?). So with that said, here is the most  
basic sketch of a charter I can come up with:

1. High-level decisions of the organization (including budgeting  
decisions) are to be made by using Outcast and/or governance software  
of a member project. These decisions will follow a decision-rule  
similar to the one we defined for editing the home page:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules</A>
(This process will in every way take the place of a traditional Board  
of Directors, of Annual Meetings, and of other governance-related  
rules that appear in traditional bylaws/charters/articles.)

2. Day-to-day activities may be handled by individuals ad hoc, or more  
formally by individual employees or volunteers of the organization.  
Any decision made by an individual must be publicly documented and can  
be overridden by the process in #1.

3. Any money controlled by the organization will be kept in a bank  
account which can be accessed by at least two people designated by the  
process in #1, and who may be replaced at any time by that same  
process. All income and outlay must be publicly documented  
(contributions may be made anonymously).

4. Modification of the charter can only be done by a supermajority  
similar to the ruleset modification-rule set out in the link above.
