<PRE>Hello, Nillus, and thank you for the kind words. Of course, as with  
the Occupy movement, Metagovernment is a group effort and I am just  
one member. It looks like there are a lot of opportunities for our  
groups to work together.

Governance tools are still very young, but I think we will be able to  
pair you with something that will work. I can make some  
recommendations, but it would be much better to ask the entire group.  
The programmers and members of the active projects are on our list  
server, and they could better make recommendations than I could from  
my position.

I am cc'ing your message to the list server. People are likely to  
include you in their replies, but regardless, I'd suggest signing up  
for the list to get a better handle on the conversartion:

Thanks again, and thanks for your work on Occupy.

I hope today's occupation went well.
