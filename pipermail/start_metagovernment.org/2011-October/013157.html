I think the monopoly will prove illusory.  An elector is *technically*
free to vote by any method, in the sense of publishing the intended
vote ahead of time.  That's a kind of primary vote.  States often
regulate the primary electoral systems of the parties (perhaps
requiring a secret ballot), but not the non-party primaries run by
unorganized electors; they never heard of those yet.

Non-party primaries are inevitable, however, because independent
candidates are preferred by at least some electors [1].  Inevitably
some of those will prefer to cast their primary votes in public,
because a public vote always has more power. [2]

I mention this to illustrate how a proliferation of voting systems can
open up possibilities that weren't apparent before.  If most of the
electors cast primary votes in public, then the secret ballot of the
*general* election would be bypassed *in general*, even while the
guarantees of privacy would remain in effect for *each individual*.
Nobody could possibly know how any given individual actually voted on
election day, but everyone would know the general results in advance.

If public votes are controlled by citizens and freely shiftable, then
they're less likely to be bought and sold systematically, or otherwise
coerced en masse.  I think the most important reasons are:

  * Vote sellers can shift their votes after selling them, which makes
    vote buying a poor investment.

  * Vote buyers and sellers are detectable by statistical pattern
    analysis of vote shifts.

 [2] In fact, a private vote has a power of zero; it has no effect on
     the political outcome of the election.
