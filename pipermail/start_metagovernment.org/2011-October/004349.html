<PRE>Everyone,
     I've been working on this concept for years and it's time this thing
finally gets online. I have an excellent site layout sketched out on paper
and it's design will bypass a number of inherent issues. I'm currently
involved with an independent contract with my college to program the site,
but I've realized that the necessary databasing is just too much for one
person without extensive related experience to accomplish in the necessary
time frame for the support of the 99% movement to be funneled like it could.
This thing is ready to explode NOW, and I'm sending the word out to all of
you, and many others, to join forces and make it happen. Below I'm posting a
relatively brief write up of the site's intended capabilities, as well as
some direction in the way of moving forward from here the fastest. Anyone
potentially interested in joining this project should know that I am 100%
interested in working with you, and before anyone tries to take this idea
and coopt or cash it in should give me even one chance to explain why
cooperating with me is in your best interest, (I've been showing my idea for
an opt-in governance site to professors, programmers, programming
professors, peers, and random ordinary people, and I've worked out a LOT of
bugs. furthermore, this site is inherently inflammatory as it will bring
people face to face with their difficulties and differences of opinion. I've
studied NonViolent Communication as well as the Pedagogy of the Oppressed as
well as the political science of the capitalist machine. I may not be able
to program this on my own, but I am one hell of an addition to the team, and
I'm not asking for much. I'll do it pro bono, just don't sell out to
corporate interests, otherwise the site will never attract the 99% anyways!)
        Anyone's welcome to contact me directly at
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">Anthonydunn97202 at gmail.com.</A> I've done a lot more writing on this and have
numerous angles already written up and considered, but for now, until
someone's asking to hear more, here's the site's capabilities:

Site capabilities overview:

1)      Most crucially, WikiPeace will enable horizontal discussion to occur
about any problem of any scale. This will be accomplished with the ability
to scale one&#8217;s search to a desired size, (I.E. city scale, global scale,
even down to individual households, organizations, and/or workplaces), and
from there to determine what space of that scale, (I.E. what city,
household, etc). The most valuable input will be the most visible by use of
user ratings, as WikiPeace aspires to embody meritocracy as well as complete
transparency and horizontalism, (the abolishment of inequality in decision
making power).

The user selects what issues are relevant to them, then what strategies make
the most sense, and from there directly interface with the selected
strategy&#8217;s authoring organization, with the ability to see their calendar,
update events to their own user profile calendar, and even set text message
reminders for events. The site is designed to bridge the largest gaps in the
process of nonviolent social organizing. In this way not only do the best
ideas for the worst problems get the most attention, but each person is
connected directly with what matters to them. Additionally, organizations
and member are transparently rated in effectiveness as well as 'karma', (in
case anyone's effective but say, sexist)



2)      A &#8216;haves and wants&#8217; section enables individuals to find what they
need from people around them as if everyone interested was running a 24/7
yard sale. What&#8217;s more is that there will be space for people to
offer/request intangible goods, such as skills fermenting, or repairing
electronics. Because everything is transparent, using these classified ads
to do crime will become virtually impossible, such as the craigslist
killings. &#8211;Individuals will have space to barter if they choose, reducing
the amount of dependency upon &#8216;a-moral&#8217; corporations, corrupt governments,
and currency in general, to meet the needs of real people. -furthermore this
is invaluable because it makes users return to the site and tell their
friends.



3)      A critical factor in the resolution of today&#8217;s problems is that
there is an immense history of the ruling classes reframing the messages of
the oppressed in ways that makes change not happen. Propaganda has proven an
invaluable tool for the generation of a public that cannot hear its less
fortunate members, for the most valuable of terms have become the most
loaded. WikiPeace is designed to leave infinite space for its users to
debate cultural myths, as well as providing a space for the most universal
myths to be sorted out on global scales, with tremendous amounts of input
from all sides, and everything rated, (transparently).



4)      The default presentation of any page will be written in &#8216;common
speak&#8217;, as in the message will be phrased specifically so that the most
people can understand it. Each page will have a &#8216;side&#8217; one may choose to
display that is for technical vernacular, that WikiPeace may contain both
the specialized language of professionals, while not leaving &#8216;lay-people&#8217;
behind. Another side one may choose to read and/or write in is in the
language of Marshal Rosenberg&#8217;s NonViolent Communication, which is
specialized for the most effective conflict resolution. It is based on
stating needs, as well as circumventing inflammatory, counter-productive
language.



5)      There is a system of &#8216;tokens&#8217; which allow users to do everything
from openly debate concepts without disrupting a page, to tracking a page to
be notified if it has been altered either slightly, or entirely. The
&#8216;tracking token&#8217; will ensure that site disruption is ineffective, as
complete transparency will enable users to flag disruptors and discontinue
their editing privileges, and important pages will be tracked by potentially
hundreds of users. The &#8216;debate token&#8217; enables users to place anywhere in a
pages text essentially a link to the debate. This debate format is
transparent, and starts with a &#8216;for&#8217; and &#8216;against&#8217; section, where the users
rate the best arguments on either side to display at top. There will be
space for informational links, as well as a section for arguments that are
neither  for or against but somehow relevant. The &#8216;note token&#8217; is similar to
the debate token, except its meant as a gentle addendum to a pages text,
usually transitional, because either the addendum should be written into the
page, or it&#8217;s on its way to becoming a debate. Sometimes it is a tangent and
in this way information can flourish separately from the realm of
distraction.



6)      There will also be a map generator which can display the popularity
of one issue's strategy over another in relation to its rater&#8217;s general
geographic location. In this way, it will be demonstrated that a &#8216;law&#8217;
doesn&#8217;t need to be something everyone in an arbitrary, legal, division of
land has to do battle over. Where ever and however a consensus decides they
want their rules/boundaries can be the very skeleton of a law, determining
it&#8217;s geography based on how actual people feel about what should be done. I
know it sounds potentially confusing, but what we've got running now is
outright criminal, requiring 'laypeople' to abide by a code that is so
complicated it literally requires specialists to interpret.



In summary, these features combined will make participation and learning
streamlined, specifically for the purpose of implementing civic intelligence
to overcome the greatest threat our species has ever known, what can only
best be described as global corporatocracy, or the profit agenda. Once this
site is up it can enable everyday people to make actual change by not only
effortlessly connecting them to likeminded people, but by creating an
abundance of necessary information, and by helping all collaborators to
organize via interest-based education and text message reminders.


***I have a lot more ideas than this, but that's 'WikiPeace' in a nutshell.

 I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
