Sure, no doubt about that. I am just asking if it makes sense to communicate 
over you, which is both slow and complicated, since you are also not familiar 
with the concepts of Votorola. I have worked on this code for a year now and 
Mike for several years. Thomas is also dedicated to the project for a longer 
time than some other projects exist in total. We are serious about our 
commitment and our concepts and we will continue to work on them, even if we 
have to drop our codebase for it and join another one. This is not because we 
don't believe in our code, but because this is not about single projects or 
technical playgrounds, but about new democratic ways of expression.

We have 25.000+ SLOC in Java and we can already vote and patch differences. We 
also do work on the new Ui combining many of the newly evolved concepts of the 
last two years or so. The feed works as does our Semantic MediaWiki 
database... If this is not enough, then they have to look elsewhere. We are 
still prototyping and we don't rush things, because democracy is not a race 
and nobody knows yet how it all will work together. This is also why we don't 
advertise our software, we want to attract activists/users directly by the 
design of the tools and finally with the tools themselves, so we have to get 
that right before making videos and spending time on intros. Don't get me 
wrong, I would love to see new contributors and moving at a faster pace, but 
experience has shown that many people are interested, but not willing to 
contribute and work on a common vision. If someone is seriously interested as 
theorist or programmer then our homepage already has a lot of documentation, 
both on theory and on the code, it is just not explainable in 5 mins.

As I understand they haven't any code yet and they want to do it in Java, so I 
am confused why nobody has taken the 30 secs to join our mailing list and read 
a bit about what we do and start asking questions. I can join their list, but 
only if you give me the address, because I don't really understand Italian. 
Btw. it would be helpful if they would keep their site in English (at least 
the technical part) or is this an Italian project only? 
I am only speaking for myself here btw.
