<PRE>Hi Ed, been quiet here as I work on software, but I have done a lot of work
on legal structures that implement non-hierarchical decision making - that
is where there is no difference between the legal code of the organisation
and the LD software that runs it. It is my view that without embedding the
principles that we work on in robust &quot;legal code&quot; - the whole enterprise is
either un-scalable, or in constant danger of being co-opted.

Some countries have legislation that makes this easier than others, and I
believe it is equally important and useful for the legal framework to be
aNational, or as close to that as possible, which in practice means making
it easy for full legal participation regardless of nationality, or
residency.

Hope to be able to offer more discussion on this after next week.

NB - as an aside the software I am working on is a distributed wiki, in
which everything is built on top of a distributed version control system. I
see this, as a foundation for LD, in that we have robust distributed
storage of documents and media, and can also clone and diff documents. Top
priority at the moment is to make the installation process as easy as
possible. The idea is that every software instance is able to store it's
own social graph, so that even mobile clients would act as &quot;Freedom Boxes&quot;

say. I'd be really interested in catching up on the latest thinking
on interoperability so all these distributed instances could talk to the
server based implementations.

&gt;<i> Hi, folks. Just to clarify: this organization process is not just about
</I>&gt;<i> becoming eligible to receive grant funding. It is also to prove to
</I>&gt;<i> ourselves and the world that we can do this. Are we able to create a
</I>&gt;<i> real-world, formal organization that has no individual leader or leaders?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the most crucial test will be to see if we can manage money. Once
</I>&gt;<i> we have a basic charter we agree on, I would like to contribute money and
</I>&gt;<i> ask others to do so as well, and then make our first spending on legal fees
</I>&gt;<i> and filing fees for the organization (if we have consensus, of course). If
</I>&gt;<i> we can pass that test, we can begin to prove that we are capable of
</I>&gt;<i> governance without empowered leaders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have continued to look into the requirements for organization. At least
</I>&gt;<i> here in the U.S., it looks like a board of directors is a requirement. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe we can get around this requirement by promoting everyone who
</I>&gt;<i> participates in the project to the board of directors. If we have to do
</I>&gt;<i> this, it wall affect the charter below: we will have to lay out in clear
</I>&gt;<i> language when someone becomes a voting member.  We can't just let anyone
</I>&gt;<i> immediately become a voting member, or else a group of people could easily
</I>&gt;<i> hijack the organization's funding for their own purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And to create a membership requirement, our software needs to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> register activity. For example, if we say someone must have been active in
</I>&gt;<i> discussion for the past month, then we need to validate that so we can
</I>&gt;<i> scale. Is that possible in any member project's software? Or can anyone
</I>&gt;<i> think of another way to do this? Or is there something better than an
</I>&gt;<i> activity meter to gauge eligibility?

</I>&gt;<i> Here is the modified (skeleton of the) charter I am proposing, based on

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. High-level decisions of the organization (including budgeting
</I>&gt;<i> decisions) are to be made by using Outcast and/or governance software of a
</I>&gt;<i> member project. These decisions will follow a decision-rule similar to the
</I>&gt;<i> one we defined for editing the home page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Day-to-day activities may be handled by individuals ad hoc, or more
</I>&gt;<i> formally by individual employees or volunteers of the organization. Any
</I>&gt;<i> decision made by an individual must be publicly documented and can be
</I>&gt;<i> overridden by the process in #1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Modification of the charter can only be done by a supermajority similar
</I>&gt;<i> to the ruleset modification-rule set out in the link above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this reasonable, workable, and appropriate?
