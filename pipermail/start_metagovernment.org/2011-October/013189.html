<PRE>Hi Ed, (and everyone),
Thanks responding to my suggestion. I resonate with the basic concept of what you've written in the promotion. I particularly like the idea of having multiple individuals reading the script. I think making it human or personal is key. I wonder though if it matches the feeling or mood of what is currently happening on the streets around the world. I find myself asking...where's the passion, the frustration, the outrage....where is the dream of something viable and enchanting. My guess is that all of those elements are alive in you....and for some reason they're being tuned to a lower octave (?).

Most of all I'm wondering where's the connect to the #occupy movement. There are general assemblies happening all over the world practicing collaborative governance....right now...however simple, raw and makeshift they may be. It seems to me they will be the early adopters of the tools Metagov is developing. I think that in a very short period of time those assemblies will be wanting to connect with each other in more efficient, complex, and empowering ways. There's a global movement developing &quot;centered around openness, inclusion, and freedom&quot;. Seems like Metagov manna to me.

I imagine a short video outreaching to that community, clearly describing your vision(s) of &quot;collaborative, consensus-based, and synthesis-oriented solutions&quot;, would put Metagov at the creative hub of a self-organizing mass of passionate, committed, and focussed individuals. 

I apologize if I'm missing something already in the works. I've spent several hours on the website and, not being a programmer, there's a lot I can't quite grok. That said, I get what you are up to. That there is actually a group working on &quot;code&quot; for collaborative governance totally blows my mind. You have know idea....
Thanks again for responding,
Steve

</I>&gt;<i> sorry for having being absent for such a long time. I was working at the University, and had little time. But now my contract is coming to an end and rather than looking for a new one I would like to focus more on eDemocracy directly. I think this moment is too urgent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also like the script. I would make a few changes nevertheless:
</I>&gt;<i> First of all I would avoid to say &quot;you are a slave&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Many people will fill they are NOT slaves, and will dismiss the whole message as being extremist. Also although we are not in control of the government we have some undeniable rights that slaves did not have. The message arrives loud and clear even without that phrase.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second: this phrase:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It is not easy, but compare it to what we have now.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> is hard to understand. it is not easy [to do?, to reach?, to build?] And how comparing it to what we have will make a difference. I would split the two concepts and say &quot;It is not easy to build, but it is doable. It will not be perfect but it will be better than what we have now.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should I just change the page?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My sense is the world is on the cusp of rapid and comprehensive change. I believe the work you are doing will be critical to the development of the next iteration of our species orientation, or evolution if you will. I think that upgrading your profile with a &quot;promotion&quot; of some sort is timely and critical for the widespread adoption of the tools you are creating. It seems to me the time for dithering is over. I would be wondering &quot;How can we go viral&quot; in order to say something like.....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Time and again we've experienced the inability of our chosen representatives to realize the outcomes they were elected to secure for us. There's a growing resolve for change that is becoming more difficult to deny and deflect through the all-to-familiar routines of spin and parry. For whatever reason, the existing system has foundered and is incapable of sustaining the needs of ordinary men and women, let alone the yearnings of the whole of life itself. The vested interests are now so dominant and entrenched that the only way to bring about a civil and compassionate society is to organize and empower an entirely new way. The moment is upon us.  Active cultivation of a truly equitable, conscious, and global collaboration is the only feasible option open to us at this point. The tools and the temper requisite to establish an alternative means of governing ourselves are very much alive and growing daily. It is now up to us to generate some new system of caring for the common body of this magnificent world. Metagov is creating a collaborative, consensus-based, and synthesis-oriented template in order to facilitate the changes that are currently upon us. This is how you can work with us....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As together we choose, together it will be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I love what you guys are doing. I'm not a programmer but I would like to help in some way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will stay tuned....thanks so much!

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There is a bit of a conflict of purpose here. To be brief, I have focused on Michael's core argument that modern democracies are not liberating. However, that excludes a lot of the other valid criticisms of representative democracy at:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks very much for your kind comment; also for the offer of the
