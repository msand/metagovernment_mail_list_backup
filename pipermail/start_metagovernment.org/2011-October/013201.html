<PRE>Hi, folks. Just to clarify: this organization process is not just  
about becoming eligible to receive grant funding. It is also to prove  
to ourselves and the world that we can do this. Are we able to create  
a real-world, formal organization that has no individual leader or  
leaders?

Probably the most crucial test will be to see if we can manage money.  
Once we have a basic charter we agree on, I would like to contribute  
money and ask others to do so as well, and then make our first  
spending on legal fees and filing fees for the organization (if we  
have consensus, of course). If we can pass that test, we can begin to  
prove that we are capable of governance without empowered leaders.

I have continued to look into the requirements for organization. At  
least here in the U.S., it looks like a board of directors is a  
requirement. I believe we can get around this requirement by promoting  
everyone who participates in the project to the board of directors. If  
we have to do this, it wall affect the charter below: we will have to  
lay out in clear language when someone becomes a voting member.  We  
can't just let anyone immediately become a voting member, or else a  
group of people could easily hijack the organization's funding for  
their own purposes.

And to create a membership requirement, our software needs to be able  
to register activity. For example, if we say someone must have been  
active in discussion for the past month, then we need to validate that  
so we can scale. Is that possible in any member project's software? Or  
can anyone think of another way to do this? Or is there something  
better than an activity meter to gauge eligibility?

</I>&gt;<i> more formally by individual employees or volunteers of the  
</I>&gt;<i> organization. Any decision made by an individual must be publicly  
</I>&gt;<i> documented and can be overridden by the process in #1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Modification of the charter can only be done by a supermajority  
</I>&gt;<i> similar to the ruleset modification-rule set out in the link above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this reasonable, workable, and appropriate?
