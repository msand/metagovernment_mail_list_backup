<PRE>Welcome Anthony,

I agree about private voting.  It poses many hard problems, including
its un-social basis (as I think Craig Simon also suggested).

&gt;<i> ... Would you like to hear more about my strategies to bypass the
</I>&gt;<i> biggest issues in making a site that replaces 'governments'
</I>&gt;<i> worldwide?
</I>
Yes.  Is there an intro description?  You gave a link earlier, but all
I see is a login screen.  (I am not a member of &quot;webs&quot;.)
