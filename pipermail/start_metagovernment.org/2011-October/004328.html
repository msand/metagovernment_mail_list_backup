<PRE>Hey,

Mike has proposed to apply the tools to our own planning (1).

Me and Thomas are definitely fascinated by OpenSourceEcology.org, but my 
original idea and what I would like to do is independent from this particular 
project. I don't think it is the right time to approach them yet, although I 
think they would be perfect alpha users as they are assembled out of free 
individuals in any regard, esp. economically.

To show the attraction of consensus based action I would rather like to start 
economically from scratch. The first and maybe most important thing to manage 
for us here on metagovernment is the development of our tools and everything 
that belongs to this effort, including theoretical exploration, reaching out 
to other projects and development of the tools. If democracy can be applied to 
economical matters as well, then it will be attractive by the contribution 
itself, making the external recognition of any law or initiative unnecessary 
for success.

Therefore I will setup a plan to do drive development of this economical 
strategy. My first proposal for the plan (Economical Bootstrapping Plan, EBP) 
is:


Priority list of our Votorola development:
* Create a good resource management Ui mockup
* Make resource management capable of driving (this) development
* Work together with Mike on GUEPO (2) to reach new developers and 
contributors
* Integration of Votorola with any other e-Democracy project on metagovernment 
if it participates in this effort.

I will put 10 hours per week (in development) into this plan as a resource.




What do you think? Under which conditions are you willing to contribute? I 
will draft it and help the process.
