</I>It is not necessarily OpenSourceEcology. It is only their level of openness 
which would make them a good fit for open resource management and organizing 
efforts over several projects. 
The plan is to prove our openness and to see how people react when they 
approach us and we point them to the plans and tell them to join and improve 
them. It will also give us first hand experience if the tools really cut it. 
As Thomas has said it, we are interested in new contributors and it will be 
more in the future likely, so it would also be nice to have some historical 
data in the Wiki. The prize is not really attractive and I don't think it will 
be before something great happens with our work. We also don't need the 
Crossforum functionality yet, we can use the properties in the Wiki to define 
some labour or commitment. If we need to adjust them than we can do it from 
inside the planning. I would like to try this under G/p/ebp?
