We don't quite &quot;provide&quot; a solution yet, right?&#160; We're still in the
process of developing it.&#160; Also, I added a link to the problem theory
in this revision, because I think solutions alone are unlikely to hit
the target.&#160; <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?a=4684&amp;b=4694">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?a=4684&amp;b=4694</A>
(What we're doing up there is drafting Votorola's home page.&#160; It's
 kind of boring as a demo, but there it is.)

Matteo replied:
Maybe there is something I do not understand, but the link sends to a page with some code, nothing else.

Mike wrote:
We're probably not &quot;willing to attract users&quot; by marketing strategies.
I agree with C's reasons for this, and I offer the example above to
complement his own explanation.&#160; We aren't drafting a law up there,
but it's a live demo of collaborative re-writing.&#160; In that sense, it's
better than any video for promotional purposes.&#160; Do you see?&#160; 

Matteo replied:

I admit my ignorance, but I can not quite understand what is going on.
There is just a page with some code on it. 
&quot;&lt;strong style='font-size:1.1em'&gt;Votorola&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;
What is this supposed to mean?

Mike wrote:
As long as we're developing the real goods, then we won't need to be staging
promotional shows on the side; the goods are a live, traveling show
in themselves; all are free to participate, and freedom is the name of
the show. *
Ed's charter is a kind of law (surely more interesting than Votorola's
home page).&#160; If it attracted just a little more participation, then
probably it would become a re-writing effort too.

But it's the charter (or law) that must attract the interest in the
first instance, and not the software.&#160; 

Matteo replied:
It is difficult for me to involve other people with a charter.
I would prefer to have some video to show
I think a small video can be prepared in 30 minutes, or just print screen and attached a few screen shots in a Word file and it would take much less (10 minutes?).

Mike wrote:
What I'm saying here is, &quot;Show us folks who are actually engaged in drafting a law (or any consensus text), and we could show them some software.&quot;

Matteo replied:
Are you proposing to meet by Skype with them and discuss?
Any other idea?

The charter:
