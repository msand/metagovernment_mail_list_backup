i Answer conseo here cause i don't have access to the other thread...

&gt;<i>Sure, no doubt about that. I am just asking if it makes sense to communicate 
</I>&gt;<i>over you, which is both slow and complicated, since you are also not familiar 
</I>&gt;<i>with the concepts of Votorola. I have worked on this code for a year now and 
</I>&gt;<i>Mike for several years. Thomas is also dedicated to the project for a longer 
</I>&gt;<i>time than some other projects exist in total. We are serious about our 
</I>&gt;<i>commitment and our concepts and we will continue to work on them, even if we 
</I>&gt;<i>have to drop our codebase for it and join another one. This is not because we 
</I>&gt;<i>don't believe in our code, but because this is not about single projects or 
</I>&gt;<i>technical playgrounds, but about new democratic ways of expression.
</I>
&gt;<i>We have 25.000+ SLOC in Java and we can already vote and patch differences. We 
</I>&gt;<i>also do work on the new Ui combining many of the newly evolved concepts of the 
</I>&gt;<i>last two years or so. The feed works as does our Semantic MediaWiki 
</I>&gt;<i>database... If this is not enough, then they have to look elsewhere. We are 
</I>&gt;<i>still prototyping and we don't rush things, because democracy is not a race 
</I>&gt;<i>and nobody knows yet how it all will work together. This is also why we don't 
</I>&gt;<i>advertise our software, we want to attract activists/users directly by the 
</I>&gt;<i>design of the tools and finally with the tools themselves, so we have to get 
</I>&gt;<i>that right before making videos and spending time on intros. Don't get me 
</I>&gt;<i>wrong, I would love to see new contributors and moving at a faster pace, but 
</I>&gt;<i>experience has shown that many people are interested, but not willing to 
</I>&gt;<i>contribute and work on a common vision. If someone is seriously interested as 
</I>&gt;<i>theorist or programmer then our homepage already has a lot of documentation, 
</I>&gt;<i>both on theory and on the code, it is just not explainable in 5 mins.
</I>
&gt;<i>As I understand they haven't any code yet and they want to do it in Java, so I 
</I>&gt;<i>am confused why nobody has taken the 30 secs to join our mailing list and read 
</I>&gt;<i>a bit about what we do and start asking questions. I can join their list, but 
</I>&gt;<i>only if you give me the address, because I don't really understand Italian. 
</I>&gt;<i>Btw. it would be helpful if they would keep their site in English (at least 
</I>&gt;<i>the technical part) or is this an Italian project only? 
</I>&gt;<i>I am only speaking for myself here btw.
</I>
&gt;<i>conseo

Hi, i'm a member of the FaceBook page of Agor&#224; 2.0 , here it's the link of the page :

<A HREF="http://www.facebook.com/groups/agora20/">http://www.facebook.com/groups/agora20/</A>

Only problem unfortunely in Italy very few people speak english, so the comunication beetween
 italian group and  other groups has to pass from translators. Now i give my disponibility
 to the Agor&#224; group to translate some pages in english, than let you know.

regards,

Subject: [MG] Agora 2.0 and Votorola ... and LiquidFeedBack









Hi, I'm Michele Morini, i'm not a programmer, i've discover this mailing list from a comment of Matteo in the facebook page of Agor&#224; 2.0.

I'm just a future user of a good partecipative and direct democracy platform and i partecipate to create ideas and concept, and i'm tryin' to collect the most informations possible from all the kind of software spread the web.

In an important italian news paper blog i've heard about LiquidFeedBack... the article spoke well about LiquidFeedBack, but as i don't trust so much this news paper i want to ask you if you know something of this LiquidFeedBack.
I know both Votorola and LFB are used in Germany in the ambients of Piraten Partei, but you know what's the difference ? and why they are not unified in an only platform ? why LFB was prevailing ?
It seems to me the interface of Votorola is much more better...
Let me know, tnx
Michele Morini
