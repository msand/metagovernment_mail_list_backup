<PRE>Dear Stephen and all,

We could tool up their forum by discussion refit [1], but I agree with
Stephen we'd need at least one person on the ground.  I still suspect
the structure talk is mostly face to face.  We'd also need a non-tech
volunteer to lead the effort, because tech guys (all two of us) are
overloaded.  But there's no hurry in any case; we could do it any
time, and it's highly unlikely we'd succeed on the first go.

There's also a question of how this GA fits in with the overall
movement.  It's rather inward looking isn't it?  Maybe it's just my
own preoccupation with theory, but they might do better putting their
energy into outwardly addressing the problems of society.

   The General Assembly (GA) is at the heart of this movement.  It
   provides a forum for political discussion and a plurality of ideas.
   <A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/structure/docs/final-proposal-thursday-oct-27-afternoon">http://www.nycga.net/groups/structure/docs/final-proposal-thursday-oct-27-afternoon</A>

Do they really need an assembly to run a forum?  They already have a
forum [2].  Browsing around, I discovered a thread Vision and Goals:
<A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/vision-and-goals/forum/topic/proposed-preamble-to-statement-of-visions-and-goals/">http://www.nycga.net/groups/vision-and-goals/forum/topic/proposed-preamble-to-statement-of-visions-and-goals/</A>

I spent all day today assembling a list of scholarly forums related to
social theory, and not *one* had a discussion as alive as that. :-)
Maybe this is a better place to connect?  Clearly they can engage in
rational discussion, so why not appeal to them on that basis?  Any
rough consensus on the problem (or even a clear dissensus) would open
room to pull in solutions afterward, and also to connect with other
solution providers.  Wheras pushing a solution first would only put a
barrier between us and them - we've seen it all before.

What do others think?

&gt;<i> Hi Michael, (sorry about the earlier mixup with your name)
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for directing me to the Structure forum. It seems this where the relevant conversation is happening. No events are listed on their page so I'm guessing they are not meeting face to face...at least not anytime soon.  
</I>&gt;<i> There are though a couple of email contacts:   <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">structure at nycga.net</A>  and   <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">owsstructure at gmail.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't checked out either yet to see if there is another conversation taking place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like the GA passed the Spokes Council proposal last night. It will be very interesting to watch the new configuration emerge. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm out of the country for 10 days. I'll follow the conversation if I can find access. 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for the welcome....
</I>&gt;<i> Steve
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. Is there anyone from Metagov actually in NYC who could do face to face liaison?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Their website has a bunch of different forums, like this for the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wonder if these are the main GA medium for serious discussion, or if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they have a mailing list somewhere.  Here Etan Ben-Ami speaks of &quot;an

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am out of time for today.  I'll look again tomorrow and see if I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find the center of the drafting talk.
