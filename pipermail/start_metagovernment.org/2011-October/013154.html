<PRE>I know there are argument for and against secret voting but I think the most valuable argument is that people are now used to it. And if we want to break the governments monopoly to hold secret votings, at least we have to do better.

    Hmm,

    I wouldn't dismiss the problem of vote buying so easily. It has a long sordid history in the US, and from what I've read about electioneering in India, it has become a serious problem in some locales.

      I don't believe it's possible to buy enough people's votes, and you
      really have to buy A LOT of vote's in order to have a measurable
      impact on important issues, without other people noticing it. If u
      really buy or force a lot of people, it is very likely, that some of
      them will make it public somehow (maybe whistleblowing mechanisms) or
      people who are not affected will notice strange behavior and will
      become suspicious.

      Therefor, I don't think it will ever become a big issue. Beside that,
      you could always delegate ur voice if u are afraid of casting a vote
      on your own.

      Probably you could make that argument in a much more sophisticated way.

      @Michael
      I agree totally with the point you made (people disconnected from ballot).
      But it's just so obvious i could never have imagined that there might
      actually people who wont agree with that. :-)
      Normaly I refer to that by the statement &quot;Form FOLLOWS Function&quot; or
      like a TED Talk i saw recently mentioned it: &quot;Form IS Function&quot;.
      I think of it as &quot;Form follows Function&quot;, where &quot;Form&quot; follows
      &quot;Function&quot; so closely, that &quot;Form is Function&quot; becomes true.
      As long as people are disconnected from ballots, &quot;Form&quot; obviously IS
      NOT &quot;Function&quot; and therefore improvement is needed.
      As long as &quot;Form&quot; IS NOT &quot;Function&quot;, there is room for all kinds of
      defects that will surface and make you realize that you have to
      improve &quot;Form&quot;.

        It should be noted that even if the authenticity, auditability, and
        anonymity challenges of online voting could be overcome, there's another
        critical obstacle. Some experts make principled opposition to internet
        voting and even absentee ballots because there's no way to guarantee whether
        people voting from home or from convenient locations would be free from
        intrusive oversight, coercion, or bribery. A private voting booth is
        considered the surest remedy.

        That's another reason I try to be consistently clear that Indaba is not
        anonymous, and is not positioned as something that can solve all the
        problems of building an online government. It's focused first of all on
        raising the quality of discursive tools and open problem solving.

          Welcome Anthony,

          I agree about private voting.  It poses many hard problems, including
          its un-social basis (as I think Craig Simon also suggested).


            ... Would you like to hear more about my strategies to bypass the
            biggest issues in making a site that replaces 'governments'
            worldwide?


          Yes.  Is there an intro description?  You gave a link earlier, but all
          I see is a login screen.  (I am not a member of &quot;webs&quot;.)
