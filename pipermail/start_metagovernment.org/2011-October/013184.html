Is code really all you can see? Do you have an account on the Pollwiki? Have 
you had a look into how the difference bridge works? Have you clicked around 
the interface, followed all the links and explored the Wiki behind it? Have 
you studied <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A> and followed the 
links, esp. the ones for the difference bridge?

The concepts are not intuitive atm. because they are new and have to be worked 
out. Please take your time to read about how Votorola works and don't ask 
generic questions like this. We all have little time and every minute (40 mins 
for this mail alone) I sit here to explain basic stuff again and again, I 
could improve it with the help of your insights to become self-explaining. I 
am happy with criticism and if you can't find something it is ok to ask, but 
please at least try to understand how it works, because otherwise we will fail 
in cooperation.

Our problem at the moment is not just some missing activists like you bridging 
different voting projects, but to find such an activist helping to build our 
tools which then help to bridge different projects of any kind by their 
design(!). So we need you, but atm. we need you and others as alpha testers to 
technically design the process of activism and mobilising people over many 
different forums and vote servers into a consensus. So to speak we need you 
reflecting on how the process itself will work out and what you will need to 
reach out to Agora 2.0 or any other project. (Think of it as a metalevel of 
activism.)
If we can reach out to Agora 2.0 with our tools, then we could spare all of 
this discussion we have done so far and fix our technical/conceptual 
limitations instead. Then we don't need promotion, they don't need to listen, 
we can simply inject the tools anywhere. We can use our tools and concepts 
virally on Facebook, Google+, Youtube, whatever you want, but please don't 
believe the buzz that a Facebook group will suddenly bring us the necessary 
people, if they then don't understand our prototyping effort. 
You could also then explain to the Agora 2.0 the concepts in Italian during 
the process to get more activists as alpha users, if you help us on the 
metalevel. As a starting point it might make sense to setup a poll about the 
cooperation between Agora 2.0 and Votorola and to communicate this process on 
Facebook. Come to #votorola on freenode when you get stuck.

I think we have the critical concepts together, but we have to prototype them 
and any contribution to this process is necessary. I am not sure how you 
imagined your contribution, but maybe this makes sense to you?
