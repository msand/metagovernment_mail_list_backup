<PRE>Hi Paul,

Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply.  I feel that a shared
understanding of the possible solutions begins not with the solutions
themselves, but rather with the problems they attempt to solve; it
begins especially with an understanding of each problem by its own
lights, and in a concrete situation.  Your reply was the first
instance of that I've seen in all the years I've worked in this field.

The problem of exclusion you describe also occurs in legislatures,
where it's the lawmaker who's excluded.  The crucial thing I feel is
to understand why this kind of thing happens, how it unfolds, and what
the broader consequences are.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Paul, thank you for answering.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;  1. When an [initiative] is prepared and presented, what effective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;     means do I have of influencing its content, or amendments, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;     likelihood of passage?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; An itinitiative is prepared by a citizen, a group of citizens or an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; existing organisation. They can launch a call to help to prepare the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; initiative. The more help , debate and critisism while developing an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; initiative the more chanche that it will appeal to a great number of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; people and that most critics are already met.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That is why we hope to incorporate this developing stadium in our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; website system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That makes sense, as far as it goes.  If the initiative has little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support as yet, then the initial supporters will have considerable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leverage with which to negotiate amendments in return for their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support.  So far, so good.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, by the time the initiative comes to my own attention, it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be a take-it-or-leave it affair.  Even if I had time to spend, my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; personal efforts at negotiation and revision would be unlikely to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any head-way against the dead weight those who already support it.  My
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effective means of influencing its content, or amendments, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likelihood of passage, would therefore be nil.  I feel you must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; address this problem, if you wish to use terms like &quot;direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democracy&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;  2. How do these means differ in effect from those provided in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;     case of ordinary legislation?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It is a citizens initiative and the citizens decide how they develop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the initiative. They have only to gain if they prepare it well with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the broadest consensus possible because once launched it can't be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; altered anymore.  Therfore surveys must give the proposal a great
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; majority (70% for example) before it starts because opposition has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to start yet. If you start with 70% without organised opposition it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is maybe possible to get the 50% needed.  Ordinary legislation need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; only a very small majority to agree (some tens of people?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To me (the citizen) this appears to be no different than ordinary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legislation.  I have no influence over it.  Regardless of what I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happen to think, and regardless of any reasonable effort of mine to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voice objections and request amendments, the initiative will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imposed upon me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;  3. How therefore does the initiative offer me an opportunity of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;     political freedom, as opposed to a threat (as I might take it)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;     of oppression?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It is a continuous development to a more acceptable society. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; question is &quot;what is better if I compare system A (representative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; democracy) with system B (direct democracy)&quot;. Is system B better,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; fine I accept it with the freedom of the possibility of developping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a system C. Even that is only possible in system C in our case.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And for me the citizen, how is this better?  I already live in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democracy and I am unable to participate as an equal citizen in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political affairs.  Now they will give me direct democracy and again I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be unable to participate.  In this regard, the name &quot;direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democracy&quot; merely adds insult to the original injury.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the stakes were anything less crucial than political freedom, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it would be easier to accept an incremental improvement as a side
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; benefit.  But the only credible way to make up for the broken promise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of democracy is to redeem that promise.  Before we can redeem it with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technology, however, we must know exactly what the promise was, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how (in a technical sense) it got broken.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will post my own thoughts in the &quot;Freedom&quot; thread, please critique
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; freely.
