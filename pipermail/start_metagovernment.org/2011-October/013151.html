<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Thank you for getting back to me,
     The officials are going to bicker over what's best in their lofty
opinions forever, I am exclusively concerned with how well anyone's
arguments hold water. So definitely correct me if I'm mistaken, but their
fear about online voting, is that someone's going to threaten me to vote how
they want, or bribe me.

-a massive concern about non-transparent voting, like with voting booths, is
that it would be child's play to just bribe or threaten whoever's 'counting
the votes', or hack results altogether. it's just centralizing corruption,
making it's processes easier, which probably has a lot to do with why
'legitimate sources' claim voting through voting booths is the only 'good'
way. This argument only makes sense without having taken a coherent look at
what the other system could look like if done intelligently.

For instance, say I'm in Olympia Washington, and there's policies written by
actual people, (with informational input from all interested specialists),
about what to do about homeless people downtown. Some claim the best option
is to make it illegal for them to be downtown, which naturally encounters a
massive number of opposing arguments of which the highest rated lead
onlooking users to evaluate the roots of the problem. Some claim the best
option is for us to unite them and related organizations in a public call of
arms to build decent housing from the most available means, (perhaps
thick-walled cob like so many underground communes and other countries), or
from unused structures left over from decades of outsourcing. Lets say these
two options came to be the most favorable two and it's coming down to
choosing which one the people want, using online democracy:
***special interests here are going to be local businesses wanting their
store's location to be free of unsightly poor people, and either solution
will succeed in this. -one uses prisons which they'll have to pay for in
taxes, and it's going to leave a bad taste in most people's mouths in
addition to adding to the overall problem, while the other leaves people
safer, less desperate, w/ less of a police state, and also leaves poor
people with some disposable income. In either case, they're not interested
in bribing the entire city, on my idea of a site they present their needs
and all strategies are written specifically to accommodate everyone's needs,
including theirs.
Then there's the average citizen, and we all like the idea of knowing we'll
always have respectable shelter, and not be under attack if we find
ourselves hard on our luck. People often derive the greatest happiness from
taking care of each other, or at least knowing everyone's doing okay. Obama
won because he knew to stand behind people's love of equality and universal
providence, look at the popularity of Jesus.
Then there's massive banking and 'housing' authorities which make vast sums
of money by the environment of people necessitating everyone work all the
time just to be able to afford their shelter and basic means. If people
don't need to pay them to have shelter, then they'll get paid less and
they'll know this is a trend in the direction of popular liberation from
their industry. They'll hate the idea, and be positioned to invest as much
as it takes to fight it however they can. These people will do things like
pay specialists with excellent conning abilities to reframe the idea of free
housing as unfavorable, while simultaneously destabilizing the movement in a
number of other ways, (which I can explain further if anyone so cares),
including getting poor people to produce fake accounts and vote against free
housing, and present bad questions and use fallacies and other propoganda to
keep things the way they are.

The fail-safes I have designed into my site are that complete transparency
of voting means anyone who's curious where all these votes against dealing
with [any] problem by first meeting the basics needs of ALL persons
involved, will have but to look over the list of opposing votes, check out
their user profiles, and see for themselves if everyone they're picking at
random, is a real person. Do they have friends? is there a history of this
user doing what other users do? is this account brand new and only voting on
this one issue? And can they explain human reasons/needs related to their
voting down on this strategy, (I've included space in my site's layout for
people to say why they rated things they way they did).

Now if in Olympia people sniffing for bots start finding a bunch of them,
(which is what it'd take for altering a whole cities decision), then the
next thing being sniffed out is who's doing this, which A)poor people aren't
loyal to those paying them and information will slip, and B) makes this form
of lobbying seem dangerous and not worth investing in in the first place to
big interests. Arresting movement leaders under false or 'terroris' charges
will blow up in their faces. Disruptors will be flagged, all their actions
are in the open. Suddenly all the strategies of the 'most powerful people on
earth' become too little too late, while people perfect their fail-safes.

so exactly what are we afraid of transparency for again? I don't see any
arguments for it holding water at this point. Transparency is a huge part of
the solution, and secrecy will kill any viral capabilities for net-based
democracy. This is boarderline treason, technically, so it needs to be
something clearly FOR open democracy and not easily written off as a new
world regime/terrorist element.

Oh, and the site capabilities overview can be seen

thanks for taking the time,
