<PRE>Hi, Thomas.

When I look at other charters (focusing on the bylaws of nonprofit  
organizations) they are mostly about how the board of directors is  
constructed and elected and how the bylaws can be amended. So for us,  
the decision-rule is in a sense the charter, and what we are  
discussing here is a wrapper around it.

A charter needs to be solid enough that a foundation would feel like  
it could provide us with a grant and know that the money would be  
handled responsibly. For that reason, I think the ad hoc part needs to  
be downplayed some. I don't think we need to functionally decrease it,  
but the charter itself shouldn't sound so explicitly like there is no  
accountability.

For the sake of simplicity, I think the third bullet could be removed  
from my version (keeping numbers 1, 2, and 4), since it is logistical  
and not constitutional. Would that make it workable for you?

Anyone else have any comments?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the process in #1, and who may be replaced at any time by that same  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process. All income and outlay must be publicly documented

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Modification of the charter can only be done by a supermajority
