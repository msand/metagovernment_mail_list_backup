<PRE>Hello Ed,

I like this basic version a lot.

Maybe we could simplify it even more, if we bring it into a single 
paragraph like:

&quot;Every decision or activity of the organization may be handled by 
individuals ad hoc as long as it happens without opposition from within 
the organization. As soon as opposition emerges, the following 
decision-rule has to be followed: (Link to the Metarule)

The decision-rule is currently being used here:

* this Charter
* the Metarule
* the Homepage
* Budgeting
* Prize-money for e-dem-prize
* job of Organization-Speaker&quot;

What do you think?

</I>&gt;<i> process. All income and outlay must be publicly documented

</I>&gt;<i> 4. Modification of the charter can only be done by a supermajority
