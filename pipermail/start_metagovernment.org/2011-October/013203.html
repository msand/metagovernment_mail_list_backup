<PRE>Hi Ed,
thanks for adding the video to the metagovernment channel.
sure. Let's see if I can manage to prepare one video per week. It is a real
commitment, but I think it is worth.
At the moment I am still recovering the past talks. In some cases I have
the audio. In some case also the video. And in some cases only the slides.
I am considering when I have only the slides to record a new presentation.

Also we have many news about Vilfredo. Both in terms of the old Vilfredo
system, and a new one we have been building. It looks like they complement
each other very well.
They work for different type of questions, different size of groups, with
different modalities (one si synchronous, one is asynchronous), but they
are both &quot;fair&quot;.  One of the things I ABSOLUTELY need to make is a series
of video explaining what is Vilfredo, how does it work, and in what cases
should be used (and when not :-) ).

By the way, please find the time to see the video on &quot;fair participation&quot;.
I am very interested to hear your opinion on that.

Cheers,
Pietro
