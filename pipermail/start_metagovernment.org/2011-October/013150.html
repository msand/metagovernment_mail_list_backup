<PRE>I don't believe it's possible to buy enough people's votes, and you
really have to buy A LOT of vote's in order to have a measurable
impact on important issues, without other people noticing it. If u
really buy or force a lot of people, it is very likely, that some of
them will make it public somehow (maybe whistleblowing mechanisms) or
people who are not affected will notice strange behavior and will
become suspicious.

Therefor, I don't think it will ever become a big issue. Beside that,
you could always delegate ur voice if u are afraid of casting a vote
on your own.

Probably you could make that argument in a much more sophisticated way.

@Michael
I agree totally with the point you made (people disconnected from ballot).
But it's just so obvious i could never have imagined that there might
actually people who wont agree with that. :-)
Normaly I refer to that by the statement &quot;Form FOLLOWS Function&quot; or
like a TED Talk i saw recently mentioned it: &quot;Form IS Function&quot;.
I think of it as &quot;Form follows Function&quot;, where &quot;Form&quot; follows
&quot;Function&quot; so closely, that &quot;Form is Function&quot; becomes true.
As long as people are disconnected from ballots, &quot;Form&quot; obviously IS
NOT &quot;Function&quot; and therefore improvement is needed.
As long as &quot;Form&quot; IS NOT &quot;Function&quot;, there is room for all kinds of
defects that will surface and make you realize that you have to
improve &quot;Form&quot;.

&gt;<i> It should be noted that even if the authenticity, auditability, and
</I>&gt;<i> anonymity challenges of online voting could be overcome, there's another
</I>&gt;<i> critical obstacle. Some experts make principled opposition to internet
</I>&gt;<i> voting and even absentee ballots because there's no way to guarantee whether
</I>&gt;<i> people voting from home or from convenient locations would be free from
</I>&gt;<i> intrusive oversight, coercion, or bribery. A private voting booth is
</I>&gt;<i> considered the surest remedy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's another reason I try to be consistently clear that Indaba is not
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous, and is not positioned as something that can solve all the
</I>&gt;<i> problems of building an online government. It's focused first of all on
</I>&gt;<i> raising the quality of discursive tools and open problem solving.
