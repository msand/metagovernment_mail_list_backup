<PRE>Hello everybody.

sorry for having being absent for such a long time. I was working at the
University, and had little time. But now my contract is coming to an end and
rather than looking for a new one I would like to focus more on eDemocracy
directly. I think this moment is too urgent.

I also like the script. I would make a few changes nevertheless:
First of all I would avoid to say &quot;you are a slave&quot;.
Many people will fill they are NOT slaves, and will dismiss the whole
message as being extremist. Also although we are not in control of the
government we have some undeniable rights that slaves did not have. The
message arrives loud and clear even without that phrase.

Second: this phrase:
&quot;It is not easy, but compare it to what we have now.&quot;

is hard to understand. it is not easy [to do?, to reach?, to build?] And how
comparing it to what we have will make a difference. I would split the two
concepts and say &quot;It is not easy to build, but it is doable. It will not be
perfect but it will be better than what we have now.&quot;

Should I just change the page?

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> system. It means that sweeping power was given to one person in the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the majority. Or much more often, it is really the tyranny of the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> minority, since 1. often there are more than just two candidates and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. rarely do even half the people vote.
