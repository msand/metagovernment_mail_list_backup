<PRE>C (and Matteo),

We don't quite &quot;provide&quot; a solution yet, right?  We're still in the
process of developing it.  Also, I added a link to the problem theory
in this revision, because I think solutions alone are unlikely to hit
the target.  <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?a=4684&amp;b=4694">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?a=4684&amp;b=4694</A>

(What we're doing up there is drafting Votorola's home page.  It's
 kind of boring as a demo, but there it is.)

We're probably not &quot;willing to attract users&quot; by marketing strategies.
I agree with C's reasons for this, and I offer the example above to
complement his own explanation.  We aren't drafting a law up there,
but it's a live demo of collaborative re-writing.  In that sense, it's
better than any video for promotional purposes.  Do you see?  As long
as we're developing the real goods, then we won't need to be staging
promotional shows on the side; the goods are a live, travelling show
in themselves; all are free to participate, and freedom is the name of
the show. *

Ed's charter is a kind of law (surely more interesting than Votorola's
home page).  If it attracted just a little more participation, then
probably it would become a re-writing effort too.

But it's the charter (or law) that must attract the interest in the
first instance, and not the software.  What I'm saying here is, &quot;Show
us folks who are actually engaged in drafting a law (or any consensus
text), and we could show them some software.&quot;


 * Marshall McLuhan may be a &quot;manic exaggerator&quot; as they say, but
   aren't some of his exaggerations coming true?  The medium is free,
   and freedom is the message.

   What I'm saying is, &quot;If we do it right, then it will sell itself.&quot;
   But doing it right ain't easy, so we focus all our efforts on that.

</I>&gt;<i> Conseo wrote:Sure, no doubt about that. I am just asking if it makes sense to communicate&#160;over you, which is both slow and complicated, since you are also not familiar&#160;with the concepts of Votorola. I have worked on this code for a year now and&#160;Mike for several years. Thomas is also dedicated to the project for a longer&#160;time than some other projects exist in total. We are serious about our&#160;commitment and our concepts and we will continue to work on them, even if we&#160;have to drop our codebase for it and join another one. This is not because we&#160;don't believe in our code, but because this is not about single projects or&#160;technical playgrounds, but about new democratic ways of expression.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have 25.000+ SLOC in Java and we can already vote and patch differences. We&#160;also do work on the new Ui combining many of the newly evolved concepts of the&#160;last two years or so. The feed works as does our Semantic MediaWiki&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> database... If this is not enough, then they have to look elsewhere. We are&#160;still prototyping and we don't rush things, because democracy is not a race&#160;and nobody knows yet how it all will work together. This is also why we don't&#160;advertise our software, we want to attract activists/users directly by the&#160;design of the tools and finally with the tools themselves, so we have to get&#160;that right before making videos and spending time on intros. Don't get me&#160;wrong, I would love to see new contributors and moving at a faster pace, but&#160;experience has shown that many people are interested, but not willing to&#160;contribute and work on a common vision. If someone is seriously interested as&#160;theorist or programmer then our homepage already has a lot of documentation,&#160;both on theory and on the code, it is just not explainable in 5 mins.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand they haven't any code yet and they want to do it in Java, so I&#160;am confused why nobody has taken the 30 secs to join our mailing list and read&#160;a bit about what we do and start asking questions. I can join their list, but&#160;only if you give me the address, because I don't really understand Italian.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> Btw. it would be helpful if they would keep their site in English (at least&#160;the technical part) or is this an Italian project only?&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> I am only speaking for myself here btw.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My reply:Hi Conseo,the group of Agora 2.0 is made by a nucleus of 7-8 people who work on it and a group of other people who are willing to work but still not 100% committed.So far, discussions in the group have been quite theoretical and I had the impression that there is a lot of &quot;amateurism&quot; in there, this is why I strongly suggested them to take a look at Votorola.The reason why they have not done so is that they want to develop their software according to their specs and their software includes collaborative re-writing and collaborative amendment of laws, and they were not seeing this in the video done by Thomas.But they are quite interested in working with you, it seems, and I am pushing them in this way.They have asked me more or less like this : &quot;Why if Votorola is willing to attract users, their group have not prepared one simple presentation about the functionalities to be shown?&quot; &#160;As you can see, it is a chicken-and-egg problem.I am just
</I>&gt;<i>  trying to help the two groups talk to each other.I will post your reply in their newsletter and FB page (which you already have and where you can join:&#160;<A HREF="http://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/agora20/285748701446787/?notif_t=group_activityYou">http://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/agora20/285748701446787/?notif_t=group_activityYou</A> can write there in English as most of the people speak in English.
