I know a number of pro direct democracy people from Italy are active on this list. What do you (and everybody else) think about the recent success of the movement?

I?m thinking about kickstarting a campaign to crowdsource a governance structure sufficient to take over policymaking at Facebook? 
Without user support, the entire platform would collapse. I believe a targeted strategy with the threat of a BDS campaign might do the job.
Your thoughts?.

From a recent interview with Zuckerberg by Ezra Klein on ?Vox?.

"I certainly think that?s a fair question. My goal here is to create a governance structure around the content and the community that reflects more what people in the community want than what short-term-oriented shareholders might want. And if we do that well, then I think that could really break ground on governance for an internet community. But if we don?t do it well, then I think we?ll fail to handle a lot of the issues that are coming up.?

https://www.vox.com/2018/4/2/17185052/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-fake-news-bots-cambridge

Specifically, what platform would be best to use in order to develop a list of goals, demands, or shared policy objectives, etc.? 

And what wording would work best to get the meme going?

impossible I will say to be really short. FB is a Company not own by the
users.
What make you believe that a crowdsource project could impose any rules?
Would you trust MZ or any shareholder?
In Italy a party with "direct democracy" "dna" has just won the election
but the DD platform is closed source!!!
I feel so sorry for myself just to be an Italian.

You know, even if they won't adopt a truly functional form of DD, they can
still be made to look bad for not doing so, as it's one of the moments in
which they cannot hide their true colors.

The users don?t own the company but they can boycott the advertisers. That might shake things up a bit. If that doesn?t work, then couple the boycott with a shareholder divestment campaign. If that doesn?t do it, then adding in a campaign to *Delete* FB might be sufficient to force MZ to accept users demands for access to some level of crowdsourced policymaking.

We need to begin somewhere. Every which way we turn it?s the same thing; entrenched corporate elite running the show. The only way we're ever going to prevail is to stand up en masse and use the powers we do have to build a new system. Facebook and other global social media platforms are readymade for organizing large numbers of people very efficiently. Seem like a no brainer to me. But yes, it is a crazy idea.

For a long time I thought that the way forward with FB would be for FB to
introduce real democratic rules to handle its groups. Once thaat was in
place, then other entities could have been handled in the same way. Also FB
itself (although I never went far enough to even thinking it, because as
Jacopo points out FB is a company). One time at a web event where I was
about to speak, I met a google engineer who was also another speaker. So
the evening before I had some time to speak with him, and what he told me
crashed all my hopes:
Q) what do you do if someone has a really cool idea for FB?
A) we try our best to ignore him, and even avoid hearing what he has to say?
Q) What???
A) There are too many issues with patents, and litigations, and who owns
what idea, and so on. And FB does not want to get involved with all that.

And that was the first part. Even if the first part was so negative, I
still went forward about the second set of questions. I asked him about
eDemocracy as could be implemented in FB. And saying that they were in the
perfect positionto really transform the world. I don't remember the exact
answer he gave me but it was really disheartening. Something along the
lines that FB does not give a s#!+ about this, and would never implement
any of this. I remember at the time I was quite hopeful. FB had just
introduced various forms of polling, and thought eDemocracy was just one
short step ahead. After that we went backward, and many polling tools were
later retracted (and only left for groups), and then thngs changed again.
And so on.

At the end I reached the conclusion that FB, like political systems, are
really hard to renovate. And the easiest way is to start a new system
planning things well from the beginning.

Which is what I am now working on in the crypto sphere (see my recent
youtube videos if you are curious about it).

So I don't think this will succeed. But maybe, hopefully, I am wrong.

Once we discover the 'right' way to manage shared resources, maybe it would
be more effective for we, the users, to collectively own the hardware
needed to host a FB alternative.

We would be the shareholders, but For Product instead of For Profit
(meaning we would own the Means of Production because we want the results).

This way we would no longer need to beg Z to do the 'right' thing, we could
just migrate our accounts and ignore FB.

Is this realistic?

Hi Steve,
"recent" when applied to my youtube channel means "in the last year" ;-).

Actually, and unfortunately, I believe this is a fundamentally
unworkable idea because it actually makes the
unequal-participation-rate problem worse: The people that are most
likely to participate this way are exactly the *wrong* people to do so
because they're mostly extremists/"stakeholders"/activerts and so are
not representative of the preferences of The People in general.
Government (democracy) must be about what the majority consider to be
fair, not what some vocal minority prefers. Tools like these therefore
IMHO are actually taking us in the opposite direction from our goal of
"good government".

    Scott

Apologies for the delay in getting back to you: I only had very
limited Internet access for the past couple of weeks (camping).

Again, if you don't trust the government not to do this, how can you
trust them to do anything else?

And as a practical matter this also isn't a concern anyway IMHO as
long as you use an open voting system where anyone can go in and
verify their votes (surely someone will notice if their vote gets
deleted/changed).

Or use any database that supports sharding on cloud systems (e.g.,
MongoDB on AWS, which is what proxyfor.me is built on). That gets you
the redundancy to deal with outages, DOS attacks, hacks, etc., which
IMHO is 99% of what you need distributed systems for. Note that
"because I don't trust anyone" is not on that list...

Sorry, I don't follow: Not only do you not trust the executive branch
not to change/delete the data, but you *also* don't trust your fellow
citizen to detect and report this if it happens to them?

Again, I submit that if you don't trust the executive branch (and
indeed the entire banking system with all it's checks and balances) I
submit that no amount of fancy technology is going to cure what ails
you. And if you do, then the technology we use can be vastly
simplified, improving service levels, reliability, and the ability to
detect and deal with attacks on the system. Indeed one of the biggest
problems with cryptocurrencies is their very opacity: When someone
develops a way to game the system it probably won't be discovered
until the damage is so great that the entire economy might collapse as
a result.

As in a government-run tax-dollar-supported database for sharing this
type of information. Makes sense to me, and would have a lot of
advantages over current systems:
1) No advertising and the manipulation that enables

2) We could build it as an API which would allow:
   a) User choice of UI (i.e. you could have skins to make it look
like any current system or some sort of hybrid)
   b) User control over the matching algorithms (e.g., filter out all
the cat videos your friends post)
   c) Allows search for content (this is a glaring hole in FB: You
can't search for posts by topic)

3) We could implement proper authentication to eliminate bots and
other fake accounts, something that will never be done by any
advertising-supported system because the economics actually *reward*
them for allowing these things.

Unfortunately we probably need a functioning democracy to get anything
like this implemented and so building that is what we should be
concentrating on. It's also important to keep in mind that
FB/Twitter/WeChat/etc. are all doomed in the long run (as is the case
for pretty much *all* technology that we seem to believe is
indispensable and irreplaceable) so IMHO none of them are really worth
getting your shorts in a bunch about. Again, we should be
concentrating on what the next system should look like rather than
trying to find ways to patch up the (probably unsolvable) problems
with the existing systems.

Subject: [MG] Matchism Manager selection process
Message-ID: <CACobxW2dy7xcpOwJD-jdBPkm6Ep17BdKbj5EBePQjoUAcNwqFg@mail.gmail.com>

Finally getting back to working on the Matchism Manifesto. Here's my
"new and improved" manager selection process design. Anything I
missed?
  Regards,
    Scott

==================================

Any adult-certified candidate may apply for Locality Manager by
filling out an application which will include biographical information
and links to social media and other informational pages. A nominal
filing fee should be required to discourage those seeking just to
disrupt the system.

Compensation packages for Locality and Globality Managers (salary,
housing, etc.) shall by specified by ordinance (no negotiation).
Compensation should be high by existing government standards (they
should be paid more like CEOs of comparably-sized companies than
mayors).

Organizations may publicly endorse a Candidate, but neither they nor
the candidate may pay for any promotion or advertising in support of
the candidate (no campaigning).

Each voter can express a preference for each Candidate (approve,
disapprove, abstain) as well as for the current Locality and Globality
Managers. Candidates are shown in The System ranked by approval
margins  (number who approve minus the number who disapprove) averaged
daily over the month.

Candidates with a negative margin approval at the end of each month
will be deleted. They may reapply after a three month waiting period.

On the first of each month if the average daily margin of approval of
the top-ranked Candidate for the previous month was more than 10%
higher than current Manager, that Candidate will have 48 hours to
declare that they will accept the position as Manager. If they do,
they will be considered "Primed" to take over the job. If they refuse,
they will be removed from the candidate list and prohibited from
reapplying for one year and the process restarted for any additional
candidates who exceed the 10% threshold.

A Primed Candidate will contest to maintain daily average margin at
least a 10% above the existing Manager for a period of one month. If
this margin is maintained, the Primed Candidate becomes Manager
effective the 1st of the following month.

The transition period shall be one month. The incoming Manager
immediately gains ultimate authority on each decision, but may
delegate as necessary. Both managers are paid for the full month
regardless of hours put in. No new primed candidate can be announced
for the transition month thereby guaranteeing a new manager at least 3
months as a "trial period" before they can be replaced.

For Global Manager position, the Candidates are the Locality Managers
who have served at least one year, but the procedure is otherwise the
same. A separate tally of *global* approval ratings shall be
maintained for this list (i.e., each voter can make an approval
assessment for any Locality Manager, but only local votes count when
comparing the Locality Manager with the Candidates seeking to replace
them).

Any Locality Manager or the Globality Manager can be removed from
office effective immediately by a majority vote of the Locality
Managers. The replacement will come from the current sorted list of
Candidates, with one-month transition period starting immediately
after the vote to remove.

==================================

To provide a real-world simulation, Trump (average -13 margin) would
have been replaced by Charlie Baker (governor of Massachusetts,
average 55 margin) months ago. Of course Trump never would have been
put in office at all under this system as he never would even have
ever been able to become a Locality Manager.

A few features/benefits:
1) Because Manager selection is based margin rather than ratio
(approve divided by disapprove) it favors more well-known candidates
and for the Globality Manager, candidates from larger Localities.
Which is as it should be.

2) Candidates are "on" all the time: Their behavior should improve in
their existing positions because they can't afford to risk creating
dissatisfied customers in anything they do. This will do wonders to
eliminate bad actors even from non-government positions. This feature
may encourage risk-avoidance, but because ratings are in some sense
cumulative (human memory being a long-term thing) conservatism will
come with its own risks.

3) In hard times there will probably be a lot of turnover, which again
is as it should be: Worst thing is to elect someone who's "big words,
little action" and have to wait 4 years to get rid of them.

4) The "contest month" allows for debates and other informational
events, but is short enough that people won't get burned out on them
like they do in e.g., the US presidential campaign system.

5) The specified 10% margin is of course arbitrary: You want to set it
high enough to prevent churn, but low enough that there will be
turnover when there is a real difference between contenders.

The primary disadvantage I see of this system is that it would be
relatively difficult and rare for someone to replace the Local Manager
while being employed in the executive branch of that Locality (imagine
the working conditions!). I would therefore expect the majority of
Candidates to hold high-level positions in non-government
organizations or to come from neighboring Localities. But this seems
to me already to be the most common transition in our current system,
so I don't see it as a serious problem. A less-serious disadvantage is
Localities that find a really good Manager will probably lose them at
some point, but at least that person will continue to represent them
albeit at a more diluted level if the promotion is to Globality
Manager.

Well, it's not really about trusting them or not, but about removing the
need to trust the government, software, hardware and network at all. I
certainly don't trust the cpu fabs nor the instruction sets (public and
otherwise) available in most modern cpus, likewise for almost all
compilers and operating system kernels, seL4 is getting there, but until
we can fabricate our own hardware, or validate hardware produced by
others, there is very little reason to expect anything but several
serious security faults in almost all networked electronics. I'm not
even sure I trust set theory and first-order/predicate logic, it might
contain a contradiction still. I certainly prefer homotopy type theory
and intuitionistic/constructive logic or some other framework without
the law of excluded middle, I very much prefer my functions computable
and sound.

You can even leak information over the powerlines by controlling the
frequencies and loads of otherwise inactive processors, and have
hardware level backdoors by doping the silicon slightly differently, on
an otherwise perfectly fine looking circuit unless you very carefully
look at it with a scanning tunneling microscope.

On top of this, we have our old friend entropy making our probabilistic
computers degrade over time, noisy communication channels, cosmic rays
causing bit flips, distributed denial of service attacks, governments
shutting down telecommunications infrastructure etc. If we're trying
make systems which are to work in catastrophe ridden situations and
dictatorships as well, then our systems cannot have single points of
failure, and need some degree of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance

And, if you think further about the problem of how to verify if even
just your own vote has been distributed, stored and counted correctly,
you'll eventually end up in the space of consensus algorithms and
byzantine failures.

Well, having a centralized service being capable of scaling out and
handling DDOS is one thing. Having it truly p2p and decentralized
without any single points of failure is another, further, having it work
when any kind of network is available is yet another (dat/beakerbrowser
might be one of the easiest ways to share files cross-platform on a lan
to this day).

Not trusting anyone seems like a fools game, but at least I don't trust
everyone, almost always someone can perceive incentives to exploit for
economic reasons or otherwise. And I certainly do not trust any
self-policing system or government where the citizens cannot audit both
the people who audit the executive branch and the ones who authorize
secret government decisions, wiretaps, dragnets, and other violations of
privacy; without public oversight whether the decisions are in any way
just or called for, self-censoring and classifying any proof of their
own incompetence as secret. Any deletions of evidence from the public
record needs to leave an immutable trail. Or preferably not be possible
at all, neither intentionally nor otherwise.

The threat model for something running inside a single commercial entity
or under the control of an opaque self-policing system, is quite
different from an open source p2p consensus algorithm. The Internet was
built to be decentralized and manage nuclear war, although currently,
centralized commercial entities have taken significant legal ownership
of users data and managed to achieve global network effects by
convenience, addiction, and a few other tricks, but at least I certainly
hope the p2p web will keep growing in traction and remove single points
of control/failure/censorship and am willing to work and code for it.
It's not really good enough yet, in terms of user experience for the
masses, but certainly getting closer by the day.

Well, anyone running a working consensus algorithm will notice
misbehaving nodes and other byzantine failures, so, I do expect people
to detect if it happens, the system very much depends on it. Are you
suggesting people do it manually by hand when they for whatever reason
feel the urge to check if their data has been manipulated? And using
what process? Opening the website and checking their profile? How does
this say anything about how that data has been counted or how it relates
to other peoples data?

At least, each electronic voting system that has been built by/for the
finnish government has been bug ridden and full of insane security
problems, while costing hundreds of millions of euros. I'm not sure what
technological simplifications you're suggesting to achieve reliable and
secure software engineering by/for governments. Unless it's based on
some correct-by-construction software design or otherwise proof-based on
some sound type theory, I'm not sure it'll be sufficient, and that is
certainly not a simplification, it easily makes development time 10x or
more (I have a fair share of experience from trying myself, while I was
studying for my computer science masters degree).

I don't see why we should build systems on principles with a proven
track record of serious security flaws. Why require trusting the
executive branch? As long as the necessary evidence exists in the audit
logs I don't see how trust even comes into the picture (except for the
gathering of evidence and its integrity), essentially the laws and
courts will decide if the executive branch has worked within the current
legal limits or not, the evidence and verdicts would be open to public
analysis and questioning. Anyway, byzantine failures include attacks by
malicious actors and general software/hardware/network issues, much more
than trusting the executive branch (for which I currently see no
relevance) behind the software. Besides, e.g. Duniter fundamentally
requires a web-of-trust, and essentially makes the whole network into
the executive/banking branch, in this case there is no need to limit it.
Perhaps I misunderstand what you mean with me not trusting the executive
branch, what exactly is it that it should be trusted with?

I presume you didn't look deeper into RMT, or I might not understand
what you mean with trusting the entire banking system. I sure trust it
to mostly behave according to the current laws governing money and
accounting, as in the sources and sinks of debt, interest rates and
fractional reserve currency; and the mathematical consequences of those.
Perhaps you mean if I consider it to have a good set of rules acting as
checks and balances, which I do not, the currently allowed state
changes, checks and balances guarantee several pathologies and
artificially induce unnecessary boom and bust cycles, with the central
banks essentially acting like black-holes in the economy. (for some
context, I've worked with making interactive visualizations of various
risk models and debt of banks, national banks, central banks, nations,
insurance and large corporations; for the finnish national bank,
european central bank, and some insurance companies...)

The central banks together with the closest financial institutes in the
economic network/debt graph receive an unfair advantage, by taxing the
added value from the rest of the economy, in the form of fractional
reserve interest, merely in exchange for doing the accounting of the
fiat debt money (adding no real value to the economy, only an ever
increasing cost, and, replaceable by certain p2p consensus algorithms).
But, this is completely besides the point that storing the data of an
e-democracy platform is completely possible to do efficiently with p2p
distributed append only directed acyclic graphs and consensus
algorithms. Solving any potential trust issues (reducing it to
public-private key cryptography and the factorization/discrete log
problem for now), scaling, latency, validity, integrity issues, single
points of failure etc.

Do you have any technical objections to this? Or does this boil down to
you wanting the executive branch to be trusted to run a software in a
centralized fashion? For what reasons/benefits? To be "vastly
simplified, improving service levels, reliability, and the ability to
detect and deal with attacks on the system"? What becomes simpler for
who? What service level/reliability increases? How do external users
detect a virus or backdoor in the actual running system? How does anyone
verify what source code is used? That the compiler and virtual machines
are working correctly? OS? Spectre variant 2 patches applied? What else
is running on the same hardware and network or has physical access to
it? Other side-channel attacks? How would the centralized admins
themselves even do these things? It seems to me it opens up several
classes of vulnerabilities. I'm not sure what your threat model and
security analysis method is here. But I don't see anything of substance
to back up these claimed benefits.

I understand your sentiment, unfortunately the security faults are 
available in published research, I can dig up some peer-reviewed papers 
and videos from IT security conferences if you're interested, but some 
googling should suffice to find how to do it yourself with relative ease 
(often with source code, sometimes just the rough sketch of it). The 
chaos communication congress, black hat and def con conference materials 
should have you taking out your tinfoil hat quite fast if you're 
sensitive to conspiratorial speculation. But the technology exists, and 
just accounts for the consequences of the current physical 
implementations, hardware and protocol designs, and can mostly be 
verified simply by thinking from first principles and the 
specifications. I'm not theorizing about who might be conspiring to use 
this or not, for whatever reasons, I just either include these published 
facts in a specific IT security threat model, or not, depending on the 
use-case, for most IT systems they're completely irrelevant. The 
importance is not on if it is happening, but rather if it is 
theoretically possible at all, physically possible to do within a 
certain budget, and if the relevant potential actors have incentives to 
spend that budget on it.

If you work with IT security you need to take these publications into 
account in some of your threat models either way, they can of course 
have varying levels of paranoia in their assumptions, like if you 
include state actors and intelligence agencies as potential adversaries 
in them it completely changes the picture. Even the top level domain 
resolution of the dns system, certificate authorities and the signalling 
system 7 (used to set up and route connections, phone-calls and sms 
etc.) have known faults and lacks trust in this case. DNSSEC and 
DNSCrypt helps somewhat, but only keys shared and verified either in 
physical contact or over already secured communications channels and 
webs of trust has a chance of handling that as far as I know. And, one 
time padding if you need actual secrecy of course, but that won't scale 
before we have a cheap source of bell states on a global quantum internet.

Initial trust needs to happen between people who know each other and 
meet in real life, then a OpenPGP like web of trust can scale the 
network of public keys used for signing the messages (and encrypting if 
you need secrecy). Duniter has the most interesting attempt I've seen so 
far, for building a web-of-trust and handling the identities and 
accounting of who is still living/interacting with the economy in this 
manner. The six signatures within the last 100 days and max-distance of 
six might not be perfect, but have to start experimenting and measuring 
the results somewhere.

Well, if you're going to scale the system out and make it distributed to 
be able to handle large loads, network partitions and ddos attacks, then 
you'll end up either implementing or using a consensus algorithm of some 
sort. Are you familiar with the 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem ? In short, you can only have 
two out of these three: consistency, availability and partition 
tolerance. You mentioned mongodb before, which now supports running a 
primary (+ secondary replicas) and providing either BASE (Basically 
Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) semantics or, starting this 
summer in v4.0, multi table ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, 
Durability) semantics. What conflict resolution strategy are you 
suggesting for network partitions? Lets assume AWS or a large part of it 
goes down for some amount of time, is the service unavailable until the 
connections recover? And the service would depend on a functioning 
connection to wider Internet? And thus wouldn't work for organizing 
people if e.g. the government, a coup, or a foreign military shuts down 
the telecommunications infrastructure?

So, lets assume you've downloaded the archive once, and do it again to 
check if any of the old data has changed, and you notice a chunk of it 
missing or modified? What now? How do we find the culprit? Was it the 
manager? Some IT admin? A bug? An attack?
How much traffic can it handle for this?

Lets say, a majority of users (or relatively large number) would decide 
to download the entire archive once or more per day, is this cost 
effective? and simple? Perhaps from some perspective, but I don't see 
how the auditing would be done reliably without making the normal 
verifying users essentially like a ddos attack once the systems gets 
large amounts of users. And besides, downloading and checking the data 
would only detect the issue, not say what caused it, nor resolve it 
automatically using an algorithm made for distributed systems.

Lets say each user needs to generate a private and public key, and sign 
their votes/actions/data whenever they add/change something in the 
service and include a reference to what was the latest version of the 
state, persist this in an event store, and calculate a checksum from the 
checksum in the previous last event and the contents of the entire new 
event (like git). Then we know it was someone in possession of the 
private key corresponding to the public key of the user who 
created/caused the change. At this stage you would already have what 
amounts to a directed acyclic graph. Can very well be stored in mongodb, 
or essentially any other persistence layer. Then if you just add a 
consensus algorithm (based e.g. on vector clocks, matrix clocks, 
interval tree clocks, or general causal trees), you can make it into a 
distributed system which can handle availability, and using something 
like latest vote/write wins you can handle conflicts on a per 
user/private key event log basis to get eventual consistency (and using 
CRDT and/or OT for real-time collaborative data), thus working in p2p 
fashion in any network conditions (even highly unreliable and 
intermittent ones).

Hmm, you intend a local manager to verify the identity of all the people 
using the system? This seems like quite another bottleneck. What would 
be the process for verifying the identity? Is the local manager the only 
one who knows what screen name corresponds to what living person? Or 
what's the auditing process here? What happens when we notice our dead 
neighbor adding new votes to the data a few months after them passing away?

Secret ballots in paper-less electronic voting are inherently 
incompatible with verify-ability of either the tally or one person one 
vote. It makes sense in paper-trail voting, which is required for any 
vote-buying/coercion sensitive topics and decisions. But as far as I 
understand now, any kind of public internet voting is only suitable for 
completely open data. I didn't actually mention secret ballots so far, 
and I'm not sure why you're bringing it up.
A private group (already knowing each others public keys) can create 
issue specific keys shared within the group, and use symmetric 
cryptography to vote in secret from the public on a public ledger, while 
maintaining immutability and the potential to audit the decision history 
later on. But, this is more relevant to e.g. a security conscious boards 
of directors or some specific interests groups, and will probably be 
kept in private "block-chains" or using linked timestamping anyway, 
which is nothing new. Calculating signatures and checksums for data 
integrity checking has been implemented many times over in e.g. all 
kinds of military and banking databases, bank-to-bank communications and 
others considering similar threat vectors etc. long before bitcoin came. 
Inter-bank comms tend to use some of the best key distribution 
mechanisms money can buy, then again, many consumer facing internet 
banking apps / checkout flows have mostly crap security and very basic 
flaws like no escape character handling together with user modifiable 
content and hashes, these fall under the "don't give a shit" policy of 
banks, insurance covers it, and mostly a consumer client risk factor. 
And, block-chain is mostly just a slightly catchier word that happened 
to reach the mainstream because of the popularity and hype around 
bitcoin and other crypto-currencies.

I'm still confused as to what the auditing process would be in 
proxyfor.me? What is the conflict resolution method once someone claims 
they have an older backup including data which is missing and/or some 
which is fabricated in the current db? What if there are more than one 
actor claiming this? With mutually conflicting claims?
How much experience in software development and running distributed 
system in production do you have? I'm very interested in seeing your 
design and how it easily verifies the good enough correctness, and its 
ability to detect bugs, hacks and losses. I'm quite skeptical you've 
done any of this yet though, without actually recreating what the field 
of computer scientists and cryptographers have made for these specific 
purposes. Perhaps there might be some technical jargon I've used which 
deserves clarification, please ask if I've used some terms too 
ambiguously or in an unclear way, I'm doing my best to express this as 
comprehensibly as I can, while I completely understand if it seems very 
confusing.

Hmm, well the source code and a sample of the dataset is not really 
enough to ensure the correct functioning of a distributed system. Among 
other things, it doesn't tell if its refusing to respond to some users, 
or if it only shows what the person attempting to verify the data wants 
to see about their own data, they would still have to check with others 
to see if what they see as others data is actually the same as what the 
others see, and establish some common knowledge, about what they know, 
what others know, who knows that who knows what transitively, and so on. 
I'd much rather have the algorithm establish this rather than do it 
manually. If the specification is a protocol, you don't have to trust 
the specific implementations, as long as the protocol constrains the 
possible interactions correctly, you can use any specification compliant 
client to interact with the network and verify what parts of the data 
has already reached consensus in what parts of the network.

Too simple in fact, at least to be capable of working as a verifiable 
distributed system; unless you intend to have a single primary, in which 
case you don't have an actual distributed system with availability, just 
some extra scaling out for more and faster reads when network conditions 
are good; or unless you use something like Lamport timestamps/Vector 
clocks/Matrix clocks/Version vectors/Interval Tree Clocks etc to record 
the partial ordering of events and capturing the chronological and 
causal relationship in a distributed manner; and, verification of 
authenticity, unless you add signatures; and, verification of integrity, 
unless you add something like merkle trees. What parts of the process 
confuses you? Or what part is not simple enough? Or what parts of these 
do you think you're achieving without doing the necessary work? 
Essentially a relatively simple interface can describe the entire api 
surface needed in a thin-client, the signature and checksum algorithm 
choices have acceptable reasoning behind them, otherwise it's a p2p 
distributed database like almost any other, except that it actually 
works in an existing browser with self-hosting and authoring capability, 
like Tim Berners-Lee intended the web to be.

Well, with a DAG, signature and checksum checking, you can use a 
consensus algorithm to agree on what data should exist and it doesn't 
matter as long as less than the majority of the network is infected, and 
a web-of-trust based system can even handle that to a large degree. I 
certainly trust cryptography and the very small likelihood that someone 
would posses/deduce/brute-force all the private keys, much more, than 
any centralized IT-system without either the required data nor 
algorithms used for sufficient integrity checking and conflict resolution.

Well, it's not about someone being able to read it, everybody being able 
to read it is actually a requirement rather than something to avoid, a 
DAG would also have all the data openly readable (unless you write some 
encrypted data instead of actual text in a comment field or something, 
or if the protocol allows storing arbitrary data then anything can be 
stored of course), and anyone wanting to keep their local copy of the 
database up-to-date is able to, and can vote while off-line/grid and 
distribute the results once they have a connection again, can even have 
actual sneakernet as courier of votes/data to/from remote places.
But rather, it's about the potential for backdoors and user specific 
massaging of what it responds with, and what is actually used in other 
calculations/responses. Simply put, the users need to be able to reach 
consensus about the data in the service, otherwise data can 
disappear/change without a trace of who/what caused it or any way to 
resolve the conflict, thus deserving criticism and eroding trust in the 
system before it even gets started.

Well, you might have confused me for someone else, I haven't advocated 
for secrecy in any public internet voting system or any other kind of 
e-democracy platform, (perhaps many years ago for privacy sensitive 
topics, but not since actually looking into building them and reading 
some of the security analysis around them). The p2p web is essentially 
the opposite to secrecy. And my concerns are mostly about data integrity 
and authenticity, to make it good enough such that the security minded 
people would be happier with proxyfor.me and to make it feasible at all 
to audit what is going on. I'm not sure how you could have confused any 
of my reservations being related to secrecy. The only relation to or 
concern about secrecy is perhaps of someone in the executive branch or 
an external malicious actor attempting to delete/change/add data in secret.

I'm not sure what you consider "the best commercially-available", but 
the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree seems almost universally 
common. Not sure what brand of it you would consider simple enough. But 
if the best commercial options suffice, it seems it's ok to use it as 
long as we don't call it a blockchain, or what counts as simple in 
distributed systems really? ;) I think you might have confused what I'm 
suggesting with nakamoto consensus, which I don't think is a good fit 
for this. Dat, ipfs and (secure scuttlebutt) ssb are perhaps the most 
evolved forms of merkle trees for the p2p web, even firefox allows 
supporting dat:// ipfs:// and ssb:// urls now: 
https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/01/26/extensions-firefox-59/ and 
DNS integration will keep getting better.

Consensus and distributed systems sure ain't very simple to reason about 
that's for sure. But putting an arbitrary limit somewhere such that it's 
not even possible to at least eventually resolve conflicts, or that the 
system is unavailable in network partitions doesn't seem very great. 
These things need to be dealt with on the protocol level, instead of 
being hopeful that some lazy it-admins are top notch and keeping 
everything in shape in a centralized system (especially in government 
IT, where the contracts tend to go to the same old friends each time, at 
least in finland), when in reality they tend to be ignorant of many 
security issues and they don't even admit/know about it/think it's an issue.

If you think that the dat project and the beaker browsers have bad 
choices in their technological decisions compared to some commercial 
alternative, I'm very interested in finding out about it and improving 
the p2p web using it. But I think you might find that the commercially 
available service implement these same categories of general algorithms, 
and in many cases the same specific choices, to solve the issues I'm 
trying to highlight here.

Sorry for the essay length ramblings, hope at least someone finds some 
of it useful.

Regards,
Mikael

Subject: [MG] Matchism Manager selection process

The only issue I see is someone 'incentivizing' a group to prop up a
manager, without money. Like small towns that only exist because of the
wood mill or something. The owner of the mill could potentially coerce
their employees to vote for a particular manager, without actually doing
anything illegal. Since the vote is public, people of the town might be
bullied into giving their support.

This isn't a problem specific to your proposal but one that I've struggled
with too.

Hi Scott,

The vision I am trying to describe is not hoping a government would do this
(and I assume government will actively fight against thus to protect the
corporations that fund them).

What I mean is that groups of consumers should pool their money ( like
crowd funding) to buy and own the hardware directly - without any
representatives to stop us from achieving our goals.

It is within this private property where we would implement the next system
as an experimental private government.

In Italy with 15000 user on the Airesis platform did not happen,when we ask
for fund to continue development and move to iroku  platform to be more
scalable.
I believe that giving the platform so that groups can establish their
decisional does not work if there is at least a federative rulemaking group
where everyone on the platform act on a geographical level in automatic.
The active members responsibility is to widen the participation
