<PRE>Hello everybody,

I just had a chat with David Price. He is the main programmer of the project
debategraph.

The projects tries to unravel a discussion by making a sort of graph of the
arguments. The project had quite some succes, and I saw it partner with (I
think) cnn and the guardian, to show all the sides of an argument.
They also have a nice video presenting the tool:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32InMNjO4tQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32InMNjO4tQ</A>

I was interested in chatting with David, because in his tool he has
relationships being set up between claims. This implies that. This in one of
the elements that imply that, and so on.
Somehow I felt that it was that which was missing in Vilfredo. Something
that let the users define the relationship between the various answers. For
example, if there is an agreement between answers, but the answers are
equivalent, then we have found the answer (two instances of the same answer,
in fact). If instead the answers all have unanimity, but they are different,
then the work has not ended, and the work now is into integrating them.

I asked David where could I find studies about those kind of relationships:
this is what he told me:
...the relationships that we use are essentially the ones that the have
found useful as we go along -- and it's simple for us to create/implement
other sets of relationships...
...the core relationships build on on IBIS and Argument Mapping sets...

A good place to start is: <A HREF="http://www.globalsensemaking.net">http://www.globalsensemaking.net</A> (where you'll
find most of the current people working and thinking about this).

I joined global sense making, which is a ning community started by David
himself.
I will explore in future the other references, but I wanted to make you all
aware of this track of research that I am following.

Because this topic is not just in Vilfredo but in other projects too.

Finally, I have invited David to join us at MG. He said it was a great
project, but did not he did not say if he was going to join us. Let's hope
he does.

Best Regards,
Pietro
