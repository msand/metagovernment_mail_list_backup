<PRE>Hi Ed,
thanks for your answer. I like the term &quot;wall-of-text&quot;. Did you came
out with it, or is it an official name?

Regarding the two solutions let me make some clarifications. First of
all there are other examples of systems where not everybody votes on
everything. Leaving aside representative democracy ;-), there are some
studies done on Citizen's Jury's projects. Please refer to this to:
Improving Public Deliberative Practice: A Comparative Analysis of Two
Italian Citizens&#8217; Jury Projects in 2006
<A HREF="http://services.bepress.com/jpd/vol2/iss1/art12/">http://services.bepress.com/jpd/vol2/iss1/art12/</A> from Lyn Carson.
<A HREF="http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/departs/government/staff/lyn_carson.htm">http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/departs/government/staff/lyn_carson.htm</A>
(who seem to be a person we should contact)

In those projects they took a statistically representative sample of
the population. Maybe 20 people, who would represent the population
respect to age, wealth, education, marriage status, race, religion,
whatever.
Then they locked those people in a roof for 2 or 3 days while the
experts in a field would give them crash courses on a topic, a
question and the various possible answers.

Imagine we are speaking about abortion, they would have access to
doctors explaining the difference of the status of the fetus at the
various stages, as well as risks of possible malformations, when do we
know about it, and what can be done, sociologists explaining how the
life of a person changes having or not a kid, maybe religious people
presenting the view of the church, statisticians presenting the state
of society respect to number of abortions, etc. It sounds like they
would need to be locked up with those experts for about a month ;-).
Then those people vote, maybe after a discussion among them (I am not
sure), and their vote is taken as representative of the population. In
the scenario this example point at, the statistical representatives
would vote for everybody, and then their vote would be taken as valid
for the others.

Note that it would be nearly impossible for an activist on something
to be present in a citizen legislative jury. And this is also
interesting, because in Vilfredo I have often noticed that the person
who is more passionate about an issue tend to win it. Not because he
has better argument, but because he just wait longer.  Not having
activists would then be seen as a positive elements. This is totally
opposite from our position where activists are regarded as the salt of
an issue. &quot;Everybody would just participate in the issues he is
interested or passionate about.&quot; How often have I heard that phrase
over here?

In any case I think we should pour all this in the wiki, as it looks
like as part of a huge issue.

Now let's look at other elements:
I am not sure I would agree that my distributed solution is so based
on representatives. Yes, the idea is that a person would vote on some
answers, but also that as soon as an answer is succesful it would be
evalued by more and more. Still an answer to be accepted by the whole
community would need to be voted by everybody. This would happen in
steps. In other words there are some answers that simply do not
deserve being read too far. If we are speaking about abortion, a silly
answer would be &quot;let us roll a dice, and we permit an abortion if it
comes out a 6&quot;. It doesn't really deserve that much attention.

On the other hand attention is important so that people can work out
other possible solutions. So I would superimpose on the space of
neighbors (the one that say who vote on what), a different space based
on topics and positions.
So I vote on the issues that arrive to me, but then I also read the
rants of other people from other places in the graph, who are
happy/unhappy about how their proposals are proceeding.

So going back to the point of representatives, you are using
representatives to vote down something. But for something to be
accepted everybody must be involved.

I partially like your idea to just have a hard limit over how long
should an answer be. In a sense this is why twitter was more succesful
than livejournal (or any other blog service). Then the workload would
be on the proposers that have to cut to the essential his idea. Maybe
it would make sense to have the person that is asking the question
(again I am thinking about VgtA, but other system supposedly would
have similar solutions), decide how big the answers should me. I see a
few problems as right now people are also using the answer field to
send comments on a topic. This might limit the possibility to do just
this. Also imagine someone asking for a name on something, and then
they put a limit of 10 chars, because this is how big they want the
name to be. But people want to explain why a name is better than
another. So maybe the answer should have a rande of sizes, and the
smaller could be the usual 250. While the longer could be a no limit.

On the side of all this, I am perplexed. Some issues just do not lend
themselves easily to be too compressed.


Thanks for the explenations about /.
I rally do not understand that system much. Is Karma very tied to how
often a person is allowed to moderate? Does it have to be so (is it
plausible an alternative slashdot where it is not the case)?

Essentially the wall of text seem to be also the issue of information
overload that is at the base of multiple systems. From wikipedia to
slashdot. Mixedink hasn't solved the issue, has just moved from a
1-version answer of wikipedia to a multiple version answer.

I have more to write, but I don't want to overload you.

Please let me add my voice to Ed's. Do not let his be a private
discussion between me and Ed:

&gt;<i> Can anyone come up with better answers than mine or Pietro's?
</I>
Thanks,
Pietro

&gt;<i> Pietro, you are proposing two different but very similar solutions to the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. perhaps something like what SlashDot does: only handing out &quot;moderator
</I>&gt;<i> points&quot; to individuals occasionally, either randomly or based on a merit
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both answers seem more workable than my solution (starting in really small

</I>&gt;<i> the same time that we are trying to scale-up community-size), but I am not
</I>&gt;<i> sure they are practical in a democracy. Both of them seem to violate the
</I>&gt;<i> principle of &quot;government of, by, and for ALL the people.&quot; They are
</I>&gt;<i> democratic in that all the people have a chance of being involved, but they
</I>&gt;<i> are at their heart a form of representative democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, I should note a flaw in the SlashDot system: in my case, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, I don't care if I get karma points. I have had several successful
</I>&gt;<i> story submissions to SlashDot, and I have had many posts modded up to a full
</I>&gt;<i> 5, so as a result I am given moderator points very frequently. But often I
</I>&gt;<i> don't use them, and many times when I do use them I am somewhat arbitrary.
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I just don't care much the karma points as much as I do about
</I>&gt;<i> making my own contributions. So there is little incentive for me either to
</I>&gt;<i> get points or to use them wisely. In terms of governance, this would equate
</I>&gt;<i> to someone participating in a community they are only moderately interested
</I>&gt;<i> in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I think it is clearly important that we investigate solutions to
</I>&gt;<i> information overload further. We have an elegant solution to the primary
</I>&gt;<i> information overload (too many issues in too many communities): that nobody
</I>&gt;<i> is expected to vote on everything. But there is this separate and more
</I>&gt;<i> subtle overload question of many people simply not being willing to read
</I>&gt;<i> large walls of text. Even about issues they care about significantly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone come up with better answers than mine or Pietro's?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could it be as simple as requiring that all proposals remain under an
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary limit of something like 3,000 characters? (Or n characters, which
</I>&gt;<i> is a number defined by the community?)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, I think better in terms of Vilfredo, but what I suggest can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also be applied to MixedInk and Candiwi.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Imagine if every person is given a random position in a (1d? 2d? 3d?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space. Or maybe every person is just a node on a graph. A question is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asked and each person evaluates only the answer that reaches him/her.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a limited nmber, as he would be reached by the answers from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its neighbors (up to distance n, maybe that the user can define
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> depending on the amount of his free time). As solutions seem to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> satisfy a local neighbors, they scale up, and reach bigger area. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could even make some long distance links to make sure that the space
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is a small world, so that each person can be reached by an idea after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> few passages. The result of this would be that the person would still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to evaluate only few info. Also he would have to partially trust
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the others, but there would be no bottleneck of representatives that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chose for all the others. Also if the system is like Vilfredo an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer could simply not go up if it isn't supported by a group, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each person can act as a stopping point if they do not support a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Something I want to add:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the idea of locality is a bit related with the idea of slashdot where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you are only allowed to vote every now and then. I remember rteading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that just having everybody voting for everybody did not work well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People would help each other, and not be objective. Instead when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting power became a scarce resource that could not be stored people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had to apply it there and then. No strategy. A bit like judges are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I think) allowed to chose what they judge. Although they can avoid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> judging something.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe I could build up a system on Vilfredo where people instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting are presented with a series of questions.
