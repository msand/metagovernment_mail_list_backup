<PRE>Well Owen,


I don't think i can allow you to disparage the American character like that. :)


&gt;<i> Roger Connors, Tom Smith and Craig Hickman say the American character is in
</I>&gt;<i> crisis, in large measure, due to the cult of victimization, which has been
</I>&gt;<i> defined as: &quot;an odd combination of ducking responsibility and telling
</I>&gt;<i> everyone else what to do.&quot; <A HREF="http://ambur.net/oz.htm">http://ambur.net/oz.htm</A>
</I>
Victim-hood is far from a uniquely American disease. Canadians are far
better at it.  :)


What exites me about participation in this list is that i hope to find
an answer to the following question.


What is the strategy by which e-democracy can most quickly and
powerfully shift the political center of gravity to something more
rational, more cool-headed, more future focused? I want a more
efficient political engine that generates more light, less friction
and less heat.  Politicians are clearly incapable of even
understanding this problem - the machine they rode in on is not fit
for use. The geeks (i am certainly one) do need to rise up and change
the system. Geeks create software and software can clearly solve this
problem.

But we overcome geekiness to do so? Can we work together and
demonstrate leadership? Can we stay focused on the big picture and not
get lost in the minutia. Can we go out and sell our solution to the
mall-dwellers?

I've played politics as an idealist and i got spanked and sent home.
Hope to do better the next time, so i'm looking for a winning
strategy.

MLP
