<PRE>Hi Ed, I am at a conference right now (just on the topic),
but before leaving I had the time to ask some more experienced
collegues. We probably could ask Coimbra University to hold the
material, which would then bu hold with a url in a very official (and
extremely high impact) place.
I am not sure how it works with video, so I am waiting to go back to check.

Regarding the fact of having the material peer reviewed,
it is a bit more complex than that.
Generally papers get peer reviewed. And if something bad passes (say a
paper that claim that intelligent design is the solution to evolution)
then the editor get's in trouble. Or if some false results. Or some
results that are already known. Of course no one knows all the
results, so it is not so hard, but the more it happens, the worse the
source (journal, conference, editor) is.

Not all papers get peer reviewed, for example invited talks don't get
peer reviewed.

And we should have a lot of those, if we want all the groups that are
out there to talk about their projects and dreams.

Some conference are also made only of invited talks. This happens
either when some big names are talking, sometimes in a huge
conference, but also when a conference is the first one. So the
conference is an occasion for all the people interested to kick off
the series of conference to come there. And, by the way, they also
invite some of the best people around. Then they get to invite some of
the experts, and thus are sure that whoever is interested in the field
will participate. And then it is easy to invite them to publish
something next year.

Of course inviting those people costs a lot of money. You need to pay
for their trip &amp; the hotel. A good hotel!

But maybe with our no location approach we could invite them to
participate from home.

Maybe we could have a different peer review approach. That is, instead
of peers stopping a paper, we can send the paper to some reviewers,
and they guve a review. The review is generally secret, and it is
anonymous (you don't know who the reviewer are). Instead we could have
that the review is not secret. After that the person can decide if he
still wants to present the paper/presentation. If he does it will
appear with the comments and the evaluation of the reviewer next to
it. SO people can chose not to look at papers that had bad reviews.

I am just thinking out loud. But it's an interesting idea :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We also should invite each and every person from each project.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we do it right we could make the biggest video review, video index
