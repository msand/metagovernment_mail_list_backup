<PRE>Tom, I hope any confusion I may have created in this thread may be cause for learning and, hopefully, for mutually beneficial collaboration as well.

 

Here&#8217;s the context for my involvement:  I am the co-chair of AIIM&#8217;s Strategy Markup Language (StratML) Committee, which is specifying an XML-based standard for strategic and performance plans.  Our aim is to establish it as an international voluntary consensus standard for potential use by all organizations worldwide, as well as individuals and families who choose to lead mission/goal-directed lives.

 

The reason I subscribed to the Metagov Startup Committee listserv was to explore prospects for using Metascore to enable stakeholder feedback on goals and objectives identified in StratML documents.

 

More info on StratML is available at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm</A>  See, for example, the talking points at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLTalkingPoints.htm">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLTalkingPoints.htm</A>

 

BTW, the name of your site attracted my attention because it seems to me that in large measure our &#8220;freedom&#8221; to vote for &#8220;representatives&#8221; has encouraged us to divest ourselves of responsibility to do for ourselves that of which we are capable, in direct partnership with those who share our goals and objectives.  Thus, it does seem to me that it would be good to move beyond voting.  (I also happen to believe the term &#8220;governance&#8221; is vastly overused and over-rated.)

Hello All,

 

I'm Tom Lowenhaupt and I started the BeyondVoting site a few years back. I've not paid it much attention lately as my current interest is with an initiative that seeks to bring the .nyc TLD to New York City. (Like .com and .org - and I presume .nz - but just for New York City.) 

 

Governance is my real interest with the process surrounding &lt;<A HREF="http://www.coactivate.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/blog/2009/07/22/toward-a-governance-ecology-for-nyc/">http://www.coactivate.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/blog/2009/07/22/toward-a-governance-ecology-for-nyc/</A>&gt;  .nyc's governance possibly of interest to you all.

 

Please provide a context for the below emails.

 

Best,

 

Tom Lowenhaupt

 

P.S. I've communicated with the demox people a few years back.

Thanks Owen,
I will take a look at those links. I would say mine is also more in the &quot;vision&quot; category than actual plan. Have been pulling bits and pieces of ideas together and still researching.
cheers
Dave

Dave, if you&#8217;d care to share it, I may wish to convert your plan to StratML format for inclusion in our collection at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other</A> 

 

BTW, Ed et al., here&#8217;s another interesting site: <A HREF="http://beyondvoting.wikia.com/wiki/Beyond_Voting">http://beyondvoting.wikia.com/wiki/Beyond_Voting</A>  While I can&#8217;t say that it appears they have an actual plan, they do have a vision and it might be good to try to engage them.

Hi, David.

 

I hope you don't mind that I'm replying on-list, but I think other people on the list might have more to say than do I. And generally, we prefer to do stuff on-list in the spirit of &quot;transparency in everything.&quot;

 

There are a few political parties which act along the lines you are describing. You may wish to contact them to see if they would want to offer direct experiences. The ones I know of are:

Australia: <A HREF="http://www.senatoronline.org.au/">http://www.senatoronline.org.au/</A>

Sweden: <A HREF="http://demoex.net/en/">http://demoex.net/en/</A>

USA: <A HREF="http://freegovernment.org/">http://freegovernment.org/</A> (site is down?)

 

I have invited the first two to this list, but have not heard back (would someone else like to try?) Foy Savas of FreeGovernment is already on this list, though usually inactive. I would think particularly the Australians would be helpful to you.

 

I don't think 2011 is too soon to get involved. I don't know anything about NZ politics, but my impression is that folks there are somewhat more politically active than the norm and may well be receptive to a more democratic proposition. And generally, social media trends can develop quite quickly, so if you have a good campaign, there is nothing to stop it from growing as much as possible. 

 

But again, the above projects might have better ideas. I know SenatorOnline did not have enough time to have the impact they desired in 2007, but their window was very small.

 

My suggestion would be to structure big but target small. That is, target the local government in your town, but make a party structure that is amenable to taking on local (and larger) governments all over New Zealand. I believe that is how DemoEx did it, and they seem to be the most successful of all. But if you think it would be better to target the national parliament, then given the MMP structure, I guess you would have to try for a full-blown national campaign from the start.

 

For branding, well... my experience is with American politics, where all voters are assumed to be dumber than dirt, so campaigns are embarrassingly stupid. I just can't speak to what would work in New Zealand.

 

I hope this helps. Hopefully others will chime in with more helpful ideas.

Hi Ed,
I live in New Zealand and have a strong interest in politics and specifically better forms of democracy. I read your introduction page &amp; various comments on the metagovt site, and I would say I concur with your ideology.

In New Zealand we have an &quot;MMP&quot; system, mixed member proportional, part of which means a party needs a minimum of 5% of the vote to get seats in parliament, which for our voting population is around 120,000 votes which gets you 6 seats in a 120 seat parliament.

I have been working on a plan for some time to start a party, the basis of which is to use the internet to guage the members' opinions on issues which are in front of parliament, then present those views to MPs on behalf of the members. If/when the party got voted in, then there is obviously a greater voice for the members and maybe they could present their own issues to. I would hope to appeal to younger voters, the politically disenfranchised/unegaged, anyone who wants to have there voice heard. The intention is for the party to be non-partisan (I realise that's an oxymoron!) but rather look at issues individually making recommendations based on what the members want.

To me the above idea seems so simple and positive, I can't imagine why it wouldn't be successful.

I'll keep perusing the site, but if you or any of your members have any pointers/ suggestions/ reasons why it wouldn't work etc, I would be very interested to hear. In fact it would be great if you could email this around to the group in case anyone is able to assist with ideas. I joined your &quot;start&quot; mailing list already and have had a few of the emails.

I'm just a private individual with an idea and a family to support&#8212;so a VERY limited budget but lots of enthusiasm. I intend to use Yola to make and host my website at least initially to keep costs down. I consider myself to be quite smart and logical but have no political training or experience. To me that should not hold a person back from being involved. My background is in Supply Chain, most recently Demand Planning which entails determining statistically what people want and where and planning the resources to make it happen, kind of fitting.

Some questions are: What name/ branding/ advertising would be most effective in gaining support? Simple or complex methodologies? I think simple would have wider appeal but not sure. Is it realistic to contest the next election which is in 2011? I want to keep it simple and manageable for a start, not try and bite off more than I can chew.
cheers
Dave
