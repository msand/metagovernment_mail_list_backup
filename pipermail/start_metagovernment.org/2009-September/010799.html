Nice.  Remove things to a distance in order to give them visibility
and longevity.  You are thinking of brainstorming, but the same image
could be applied to consensus building in general.

Or a similar image: Everyday conversation is like a fast moving
stream, and agreements are like small, darting fish.  They are quick
to appear, and just as quick to disappear.  We want to give them a
longer life, so we formalize them in an external medium where they
gain in visibility.  This is all they need.  Back in the living
stream, they can now live longer and grow larger.  (So a small-scale
agreement between a few people is made public, and thereby has a
chance to grow into a wider consensus.)

(Suresh and crew at OpenKollab have been talking about instrumenting
 chat streams, but for a different purpose.)
