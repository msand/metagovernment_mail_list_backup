</I>
maybe not, (it is yet-to-be-experimented), but we believe that this
feature, in addition to the feature that calculates the number of
seconds before the user is allowed to rate the comment/amend based on
the lenght of it will slowly &quot;teach&quot; users that since they have to wait
a few seconds, and their eyes will inevitably be focused on that block
of text, they might as well read or skim through it and just don't give
a &quot;random&quot; rate, but a more approximate rate from what they saw.


&gt;&gt;<i> Also, we thought about an algorithm that gets the length of a given
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amend/comment and calculates a number of seconds needed before the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user is really allowed to rate it (ie.: based on configurable average
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reading speeds - ie. 400wpm for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="skimminghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28process%29#Reading_rate">skimminghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28process%29#Reading_rate</A>).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This could be a better approach in terms of usability. What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds arbitrary and unlikely to be very effective. All a person
</I>&gt;<i> has to do is wait until the button allows them to rate.
</I>we are talking about a few seconds, there will be a configurable cap in
the admin page (i.e.: not more than 10secs), to avoid breaking the user
experience. the intention is to teach users to collaborate by rating
before reading/skimming the text.


&gt;<i> They could be playing video games or talking on the phone for all you
</I>&gt;<i> know. It makes me think of some websites where they don't let you
</I>&gt;<i> click the &quot;Agree&quot; button on their terms-of-use until you scroll all
</I>&gt;<i> the way to the bottom.Most people just immediately scroll all the way
</I>&gt;<i> down (still without reading) and then click the Accept button.
</I>That's much different from the scenario of draft2gether, where the user
is rating comments/amends to the current version, not long &quot;walls of
text&quot; neither the whole document...

&gt;<i> Alternately, what if a person reads most of something but then has to
</I>&gt;<i> log out for the day. They come back the next day, read the last bit
</I>&gt;<i> they hadn't read yet, but then still can't rate because of a time limit?
</I>no, the time limit is very short, the user mustn't have his ux broken by
the feature...
