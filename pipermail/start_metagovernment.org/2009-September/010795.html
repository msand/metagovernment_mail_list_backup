<PRE>I happened to be reading some legislation and realized that sometimes  
extreme detail is in fact necessary. For example, this was specifying  
that people had one year to file a form, then went into detail about  
what precisely was meant by one year in this case. A reasonable  
specification.

So anyway, it occurs to me that this is a good opportunity to return  
to the analogy between a code of laws and software code. When  
developing code, programmers don't (or shouldn't) just jump in and  
start developing the finished product. Instead, they (and often other  
involved parties) sit down and decide on the requirements.

So can't laws be developed in the same way? All we would need is a two  
(or more) stage system. General proposals are made in the first stage,  
and if a general proposal garners a consensus, then people can propose  
the details of how to flush it out in the second stage. If no second  
stage proposal wins, the process resets.

These stages might even require very different processes. For example,  
something like NationBuilder or Vilfredo would work well for the first  
stage, but something like Draft2Gether or MixedInk would work better  
for the second stage.
