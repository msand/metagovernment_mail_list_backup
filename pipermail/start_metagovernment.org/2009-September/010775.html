<PRE>I have to admit I haven't had much time to look at MixedInk, but I  
have given it a quick review in response to the last thread. I wanted  
to mention was the things we could learn from what MixedInk has done  
so far, good and bad.

Collaborative Editing:
First is the obvious feature of collaborative editing, with revisions  
tied to authors. If I understand correctly, something somewhat similar  
is being built into Candiwi. It is especially great to be able to see  
each authors' contribution.

Information Overload:
A real drawback I see to MixedInk is the overwhelming amount of text  
one has to delve through to properly evaluate a project. In addition  
to reading through a potentially-long essay, one then might have to  
read through five, ten, or a thousand different versions. It seems  
like only a few versions would get much play, and only a few people  
would want to participate in the first place. This is evidenced by the  
rather low participation their big-visibility projects get. The  
solution to this overload, I think, is not to ask people how to  
transform the technology of the governments of Europe or the United  
States, but rather to ask where a chess club should have its next  
tournament. A much, much smaller focus would increase participation  
from a small group of people who really care, while simultaneously  
narrowing the focus enough that there wouldn't be so many  
permutations. Once that system is worked out, then it can scale up  
gradually and we'll see how it goes.

Scoring Proposals:
I haven't looked too hard at how they use their scores (like is there  
any drive toward consensus, like our idea of synthesis scoring?), but  
I do notice that they do a 9-point system disguised as a 5-star system  
(by simply allowing for half-stars, but apparently not having a 0-star  
score). Their scores are nicely translated too, as:
0.5 - Worst. Ever.
1.0 - Just plain awful
1.5 - Firmly against it
2.0 - Sorta against it
2.5 - I could take it or leave it
3.0 - Somewhat represents my view
3.5 - Pretty good
4.0 - Very well said
4.5 - Amazing
5.0 - Best. Ever.

Closed Source:
Clearly the biggest drawback of MixedInk is that it is a closed  
source, for-profit venture. Personally I see that as a critical flaw  
(in the context of democracy) simply because closed source is not  
audible (or improvable/adaptable) and because democracy can't be run  
by a commercial entity. Democracy must of course include and  
accommodate commercial entities, but it doesn't make sense to have  
democratic institutions controlled by a single company.
