<PRE>Pietro, you are proposing two different but very similar solutions to  
the information overload issue (or what could be called the Wall-of- 
Text issue):

1. distributing different policy permutations out to individuals so  
any individual only has to evaluate a few.

2. perhaps something like what SlashDot does: only handing out  
&quot;moderator points&quot; to individuals occasionally, either randomly or  
based on a merit system.

Both answers seem more workable than my solution (starting in really  
small groups and hoping that we'll learn how to scale-up information- 
handling at the same time that we are trying to scale-up community- 
size), but I am not sure they are practical in a democracy. Both of  
them seem to violate the principle of &quot;government of, by, and for ALL  
the people.&quot; They are democratic in that all the people have a chance  
of being involved, but they are at their heart a form of  
representative democracy.

Additionally, I should note a flaw in the SlashDot system: in my case,  
for example, I don't care if I get karma points. I have had several  
successful story submissions to SlashDot, and I have had many posts  
modded up to a full 5, so as a result I am given moderator points very  
frequently. But often I don't use them, and many times when I do use  
them I am somewhat arbitrary. Personally I just don't care much the  
karma points as much as I do about making my own contributions. So  
there is little incentive for me either to get points or to use them  
wisely. In terms of governance, this would equate to someone  
participating in a community they are only moderately interested in.

But I think it is clearly important that we investigate solutions to  
information overload further. We have an elegant solution to the  
primary information overload (too many issues in too many  
communities): that nobody is expected to vote on everything. But there  
is this separate and more subtle overload question of many people  
simply not being willing to read large walls of text. Even about  
issues they care about significantly.

Can anyone come up with better answers than mine or Pietro's?

Could it be as simple as requiring that all proposals remain under an  
arbitrary limit of something like 3,000 characters? (Or n characters,  
which is a number defined by the community?)

</I>&gt;<i> This is a limited nmber, as he would be reached by the answers from
</I>&gt;<i> its neighbors (up to distance n, maybe that the user can define
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the amount of his free time). As solutions seem to
</I>&gt;<i> satisfy a local neighbors, they scale up, and reach bigger area. We
</I>&gt;<i> could even make some long distance links to make sure that the space
</I>&gt;<i> is a small world, so that each person can be reached by an idea after
</I>&gt;<i> few passages. The result of this would be that the person would still
</I>&gt;<i> have to evaluate only few info. Also he would have to partially trust
</I>&gt;<i> the others, but there would be no bottleneck of representatives that
</I>&gt;<i> chose for all the others. Also if the system is like Vilfredo an
</I>&gt;<i> answer could simply not go up if it isn't supported by a group, so

</I>&gt;<i> People would help each other, and not be objective. Instead when
</I>&gt;<i> voting power became a scarce resource that could not be stored people
</I>&gt;<i> had to apply it there and then. No strategy. A bit like judges are not
</I>&gt;<i> (I think) allowed to chose what they judge. Although they can avoid
</I>&gt;<i> judging something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I could build up a system on Vilfredo where people instead of
</I>&gt;<i> voting are presented with a series of questions.
