<PRE>Pietro,


Thanks, this is a faciniating discussion and these are good points. To
rephrase the topic:What is an algorithm of direct or participatory
democracy where participants are equal, there are not predefined
choices, and the process can scale to millions?

The vilfredo paper describes a very good starting point for this, but
as you said there - equilibrium answers are far from guaranteed.

You are correct to presume i am conceding some ground to the
status-quo in my description. I assume the existence of insiders and
outsiders - the difference between the two groups may be explicit, or
simply a defacto relationship that evolves because while individuals
may be awarded equal votes, there is a natural tendency that those who
participate more often or more deeply have more qualitative input into
the process.

Everyone gets a vote but who chooses the question, who calls the
meeting, who creates the agenda, who calls the vote, who facilitates
the meeting.

In a linear two phase process one might presume ( though it is not
strictly necessary) that phase one has a larger population. Maybe not
but the process has to be some kind of funnel, distilling a large
volume of input into a small volume of output.

I would like to see processes where phase one is ongoing and
simultaneous with phase two, allowing for realtime interaction and
accountability between the participating populations.

At the crux of Ed's first post was the &quot;hard problem&quot; of comparing a
summary text with a larger detail text and confirming or denying that
the details represent a successful extrapolation of the original
concept. A computer would have a very tough time doing that.
Individual humans have a tough time doing that, cause language itself
it very slippery.  Only when you scale up to many humans perhaps can
you reliably deliver and answer to the hard problem.

Imagine that the phase one population of 100,000 people produced 1000
value statements.  How do we consolidate those 1000 value statements
into 10 value statements, and then - the trickiest part re-inflate
those ten value statements into technical regulations.  If we reject
that computers can do this (for now) then we have to slow the process
down a lot to allow multiple observers to simultaneously rank order
two chunks of text?

The average result of 100 people (represenative sample) saying
&quot;warmer&quot; or &quot;colder&quot; in a simple 2-D world would guide a legislator to
the optimal policy.  In the real world though policyspace is not flat
and you will have local and regional peaks of fitness.  In this world
&quot;gaming the system&quot; is possible and likely.  Yikes. I think a
mathematician might throw up his hands and say &quot;politics will usually
fail to find the global max.&quot; True. But math guys are into perfection.
I'm not. There is worse and better processes.

I very much like the concept you mentioned about grabbing phases from
IM and approving or seconding (or disaproving) - i agree and think
this stuff is pretty doable - with the potential flaw being that the
sound bite size text can mean many different things to many people.
and still expanding the volume of contributions is easier than
distilling.

ok i'm rambling around a little. back to work.

a real world example of this kind of algorithm is the Iowa Caucus.
(particularly the democrat's version)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The use and utility of &quot;debate by edit&quot; in a wiki is really robust if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people can adjust to the cultural norms required. I think it can work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standalone for small groups. But, it wouldn't work as a standalone for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mass particpation drafting laws.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Robust, centralized, open, strictly version controlled primary text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be the backbone of the process. Do we agree on this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the core you would have a group of &quot;superusers&quot; persons or entities

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> primarily need to function like paperweights - holding down sections
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of text that have been agreed on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One ring outside of that, you could have multiple instances of the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of same text - giving the ability to propose amendments which can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> championed by some superusers as actual amendments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A ring outside of that you have something akin to focus group testing,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> open to casual participation - which can be an online version of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> almost any type of facilitated consultation or visioning process. (the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; [mailto:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start-bounces at metagovernment.org</A>] On Behalf Of Ed Pastore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Sent: Thursday, September 24, 2009 9:53 PM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; To: Metagovernment Startup Committee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Subject: [Start] Walls of Text - Software analogy for code development
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I happened to be reading some legislation and realized that sometimes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; extreme detail is in fact necessary. For example, this was specifying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that people had one year to file a form, then went into detail about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; what precisely was meant by one year in this case. A reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; specification.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; So anyway, it occurs to me that this is a good opportunity to return
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to the analogy between a code of laws and software code. When
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; developing code, programmers don't (or shouldn't) just jump in and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; start developing the finished product. Instead, they (and often other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; involved parties) sit down and decide on the requirements.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; So can't laws be developed in the same way? All we would need is a two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (or more) stage system. General proposals are made in the first stage,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and if a general proposal garners a consensus, then people can propose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the details of how to flush it out in the second stage. If no second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; stage proposal wins, the process resets.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; These stages might even require very different processes. For example,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; something like NationBuilder or Vilfredo would work well for the first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; stage, but something like Draft2Gether or MixedInk would work better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for the second stage.
