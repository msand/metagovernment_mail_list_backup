<PRE>With reference to Michael's comment, Dietrich Dorner says, we human beings
&quot;court failure in predictable ways.&quot;
<A HREF="http://ambur.net/failure.pdf">http://ambur.net/failure.pdf</A> 

Donald Norman says the greatest peril is that of &quot;experiencing when one
should be reflecting ... where entertainment takes precedence over thought.&quot;
<A HREF="http://ambur.net/smart.htm">http://ambur.net/smart.htm</A> 

Roger Connors, Tom Smith and Craig Hickman say the American character is in
crisis, in large measure, due to the cult of victimization, which has been
defined as: &quot;an odd combination of ducking responsibility and telling
everyone else what to do.&quot; <A HREF="http://ambur.net/oz.htm">http://ambur.net/oz.htm</A> 

James Surowiecki says, &quot;Under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably
intelligent, and are often smarter
than the smartest people in them.&quot; <A HREF="http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf">http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf</A> However,
four conditions must be met: diversity of opinion, independence,
decentralization, and aggregation

Jean Lipman-Blumen, says: &quot;Although it is hard to believe, we tend to prefer
toxic leaders for a host of tantalizing reasons...&quot; Indeed, she asserts,
&quot;When we don't have them, we go to great lengths to create them.&quot;

Hopefully, eDemocracy initiatives won't merely try to &quot;pave the cow path&quot;
but, rather, change the dynamic to focus on personal responsibility and
collective action to do for ourselves that of which we are capable, rather
than continuing to divest our responsibilities to others who are by our
collective inaction empowered to force others to do that which may or may
not truly be in their best interest.

Success is defined by preparation meeting opportunity.  It seems to me that
information technology holds vast untapped potential to support vastly more
effective human action and interaction.  Hopefully, we will not be blinded
to such potentials by outmoded thinking and courtship of predictable
failure.

Hi Ed, Pietro, All

[deleted]

But why do so many direct democracy attempts fail? Lack of
participation. My main reflection on that is that most humans are not
wired for direct democracy, and don't care or have time for all the
details.
