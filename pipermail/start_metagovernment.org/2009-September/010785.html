Votorola is a great solution to this, but the other approaches have  
their value as well. Direct democracy can allow for delegation without  
necessarily having a structured system like Votorola. It can be  
completely unstructured: where people agree to let others make the  
decisions simply by their choice not to participate at this time.

There are benefits and drawbacks to either approach, which is why it's  
great that we have both approaches involved here and we can see how  
they play out in comparison to each other. I sincerely expect (hope?)  
that communities will try several forms of governance software before  
picking the one that works best for their membership.
