<PRE>Hi Ed,

On Sat, Sep 19, 2009 at 4:15 PM, Ed Pastore &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A>&gt; wrote:

</I>&gt;<i> bad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Collaborative Editing:
</I>&gt;<i> First is the obvious feature of collaborative editing, with revisions tied
</I>&gt;<i> to authors. If I understand correctly, something somewhat similar is being
</I>&gt;<i> built into Candiwi. It is especially great to be able to see each authors'
</I>&gt;<i> contribution.
</I>
I agree that it is very good. It is somehow sexy to be able to
actually see how a document is really the production of multiple
hands. I hope this way of doing catches up on wikimedia as well.

On the other hand I am always a bit unconvinced about systems where a
person can take decisions based on their trust, like and dislike about
other people. I like the idea to have to fend its own way toward the
top of visibility. I am afraid someone might censor something just
because someone has wrote it, or copy something else for the same
reason.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Information Overload:
</I>&gt;<i> A real drawback I see to MixedInk is the overwhelming amount of text one has
</I>&gt;<i> to delve through to properly evaluate a project. In addition to reading
</I>&gt;<i> through a potentially-long essay, one then might have to read through five,
</I>&gt;<i> ten, or a thousand different versions. It seems like only a few versions
</I>&gt;<i> would get much play, and only a few people would want to participate in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place. This is evidenced by the rather low participation their
</I>&gt;<i> big-visibility projects get.
</I>
I agree with your analysis, but not necessarily with your solution.
This is a big problem and we had the same problem in Vilfredo (some
people not supporting some thing sjust because they could not be
bothered to read them all).

I think we are clashing against a real problem here. As we try to get
the idea to be at the center, instead of the people we are not allowed
anymore to trust one expert. Imagine if to decide the trial on the
shooting of JFK every person in the US had to read the full document
of the acts, and declaration from the trial.


&gt;<i> The solution to this overload, I think, is not
</I>&gt;<i> to ask people how to transform the technology of the governments of Europe
</I>&gt;<i> or the United States, but rather to ask where a chess club should have its
</I>&gt;<i> next tournament. A much, much smaller focus would increase participation
</I>&gt;<i> from a small group of people who really care, while simultaneously narrowing
</I>&gt;<i> the focus enough that there wouldn't be so many permutations. Once that
</I>&gt;<i> system is worked out, then it can scale up gradually and we'll see how it
</I>&gt;<i> goes.
</I>
I am not sure about this solution. There are plenty of systems that
only work at certain size and do not scale up. The idea of smoothing
it out at one size is good. And can be used to make it work better at
other sizes, but it will not make it necessarily scale better. It
seems a bit like cleaning a car to make it run faster. For that you
need to test it at other sizes, and since we have the luck of an
american president who is pro-e-government we should jump at this
occasion.

So what solution we could do?
Maybe we could consider a fully decentralized system.
Sorry, I think better in terms of Vilfredo, but what I suggest can
also be applied to MixedInk and Candiwi.

Imagine if every person is given a random position in a (1d? 2d? 3d?)
space. Or maybe every person is just a node on a graph. A question is
asked and each person evaluates only the answer that reaches him/her.
This is a limited nmber, as he would be reached by the answers from
its neighbors (up to distance n, maybe that the user can define
depending on the amount of his free time). As solutions seem to
satisfy a local neighbors, they scale up, and reach bigger area. We
could even make some long distance links to make sure that the space
is a small world, so that each person can be reached by an idea after
few passages. The result of this would be that the person would still
have to evaluate only few info. Also he would have to partially trust
the others, but there would be no bottleneck of representatives that
chose for all the others. Also if the system is like Vilfredo an
answer could simply not go up if it isn't supported by a group, so
each person can act as a stopping point if they do not support a
possible answer.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scoring Proposals:
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't looked too hard at how they use their scores (like is there any
</I>&gt;<i> drive toward consensus, like our idea of synthesis scoring?), but I do
</I>&gt;<i> notice that they do a 9-point system disguised as a 5-star system (by simply
</I>&gt;<i> allowing for half-stars, but apparently not having a 0-star score). Their
</I>&gt;<i> scores are nicely translated too, as:
</I>&gt;<i> 0.5 - Worst. Ever.
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 - Just plain awful
</I>&gt;<i> 1.5 - Firmly against it
</I>&gt;<i> 2.0 - Sorta against it
</I>&gt;<i> 2.5 - I could take it or leave it
</I>&gt;<i> 3.0 - Somewhat represents my view
</I>&gt;<i> 3.5 - Pretty good
</I>&gt;<i> 4.0 - Very well said
</I>&gt;<i> 4.5 - Amazing
</I>&gt;<i> 5.0 - Best. Ever.
</I>
Hmmm, I personally don't like every time someone take a 1 dimensional
thing, and try to give them meaning. Meanings are always
multidimensional. In any case what they are trying to do is to make
sure that people are somehow consistend in the way they vote. A better
way would be what they do at hotornot (hotornot.com). Here you vote
for how hot is a person. The votes are renormalised based on your past
votings, so if you only vote 4 and 5 stars then 4 means no and 5 means
yes. They can do this because you HAVE to vote for each girl they
present you. So there is no ignoring the rating option. I think the
way they do is fuly supported from a statistical point of view. I am
sure they renormalise the average of the votes. I suspect they also
renormalise the standard deviation.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Closed Source:
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly the biggest drawback of MixedInk is that it is a closed source,
</I>&gt;<i> for-profit venture. Personally I see that as a critical flaw (in the context
</I>&gt;<i> of democracy) simply because closed source is not audible (or
</I>&gt;<i> improvable/adaptable) and because democracy can't be run by a commercial
</I>&gt;<i> entity. Democracy must of course include and accommodate commercial
</I>&gt;<i> entities, but it doesn't make sense to have democratic institutions
</I>&gt;<i> controlled by a single company.
</I>
agreed, but is this so bad to not use it at all if we need to write up
something? We would use a Google tool, I think. It is common for tools
to be made first as closed source, and then as open source which
eventually catches up. Think about mindmanager and freemind. IE and
Firefox (ok ok the story is longer), ...

Something I want to add:
the idea of locality is a bit related with the idea of slashdot where
you are only allowed to vote every now and then. I remember rteading
that just having everybody voting for everybody did not work well.
People would help each other, and not be objective. Instead when
voting power became a scarce resource that could not be stored people
had to apply it there and then. No strategy. A bit like judges are not
(I think) allowed to chose what they judge. Although they can avoid
judging something.

Maybe I could build up a system on Vilfredo where people instead of
voting are presented with a series of questions.



Cheers,
Pietro
