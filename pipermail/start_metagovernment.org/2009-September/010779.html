<PRE>Hi Ed, Pietro, All


I think some really interesting points are being made here about the
scalability and performance of e-democracy systems.


In the article a week ago in the nyt &quot;democracy 2.0 needs an upgrade&quot;
the author reflected on how the results of direct participation
efforts are somewhat weaker than than they need to be in terms of
getting qualitatively superior plans (than current legislative systems
produce).

I think everyone on this list agrees that direct and &quot;emergent&quot;
democracy is the way of the future. In the next decade i think we hope
to see these forms compete for legitimacy with the traditional
institutions. E-democracy tools can also wildly improve the results of
the existing parliamentary/congressional systems, so producing &quot;better
plans&quot; is a moving target,  but kinda like the internal combustion
engine, we will hit a wall where squeezing more milage out of this old
technology (representative d) is physically impossible.


But why do so many direct democracy attempts fail? Lack of
participation. My main reflection on that is that most humans are not
wired for direct democracy, and don't care or have time for all the
details. Sure some people swing that way but most people most of the
time tend to pick somebody they like and follow.

This is where the work that michael allan and thomas vonderElbe i
think provides an important missing component. I was fortunate to have
a sit down with michael last week and his concept about a voting
cascade really opened my eyes that this fills a huge hole in the
emergent democracy universe. what do we do about the 96% of people who
are only mildly interested in politics?

 - I first came to know about the voterola idea a couple years ago and
to be honest i thought it was a &quot;neat trick&quot; but kinda out there.  now
that i understand the project better and the way that they are
developing the project as a &quot;pollserver&quot; which can (or will)
read/collect votes and polls from almost any kind of website - now it
is more of a &quot;wow&quot; response. I am far from fluent or what they are
doing or where they want to take it but i am certainly enthusiastic
about the concept.

Any one not familiar with the project - what they are working on is a
&quot;voting cascade&quot; that can handle pretty much any democratic decision,
policy or person. The cascade is an &quot;always on&quot; proxy system where
each individual places their trust in someone else, who is either
advancing a proposal or just being an advocate. In the cascade you can
&quot;vote&quot; for your friend, your neighbor or the president, big or small,
low or high, it doesn't matter. Wherever you put your vote, that
person will wield your proxy and your democratic interest is
represented by the person you deem best. Those people you vote for
cast their vote in turn, and those people vote for others. Eventually
a majority of those votes cascade into one leading candidate/solution.
People get a vote for each decision, so you don't need to put all your
proxy votes with one person, but you always have defaults established
so that your vote is always pointing somewhere. Maybe you have three
public figures you respect so you default your social policy, economic
policy, foreign policy votes to each of these people in turn, who then
may play &quot;powerbroker&quot; to compose or effect the actual language of
what becomes law.


The operating question for all voters/paticipants is always &quot;who do
you trust&quot;. This is unique to this voting method. - but the more you
think about it the more it makes sense to me that trust, not votes,
not proposals, is the fundamental element in democracy.  Where you
place your trust is the fundamental decision that all the rest follows
from.

for example we all have news sources that we trust. these news sources
frame every thought we have about politics. If i read the globe and
mail everyday, well like it or not i am more or less a meat puppet for
the G&amp;M, but that is fine because of all the options i trust them most
to have a balanced point of view. I am quite aware that what i read
five years ago is the foundation of what i believe today.


Who i trust defines more than anything where i exist in democracy
space. Who i trust is measurable and trackable, and non-specific to
issues or decisions, so the information is always valid. Through
social networking sites, i am continuously adding information about
who i trust or follow, so linking these preferences to democracyspace
seems all but inevitable.

If democracy is a marketplace, who i trust is like the portfolio i
hold. In this analogy, the vote cascade can and hopefully will
function like a stock market - each day we can learn about who the big
movers are, locally and globally. Think tanks, NGO's and celebrities
will be the democracyspace's equivalent to global corporations, except
in democracyspace there is solid and vigorous representation from the
local and micro-local levels. Because i can change who i trust at any
time - it keeps everyone honest.

Overall in such a system i think you would see (you would want to see)
a fairly smooth gradient of power and accountability. If you do the
math, you know that the exponential nature of the cascade will mean
that for any given vote/poll you will observe 1-10 degrees of
separation (usually less than five) between individual voters and
winning candidates/proposals. The reality of politics is that in all
cases, you need a significant voting block maintain real
accountability. If one of your supporters brings 10% of your total
votes - you will always take their calls and accept their amendments
whenever possible. If your supporters are at odds with each other, you
have to work out a sensible compromise to keep one or both from
jumping ship. As individual voters, we are always looking for &quot;hard
working reps (big or small) who know and understand us, and who get
results week after week, keeping us informed as necessary. All of this
produces, i think, a healthy and stable democracy.


The voting cascade is not a magic bullet of course, we need a whole
range of tools for transparency, evaluating and ranking proposals, but
it provides a good idea for a baseline system that i can imagine a
majority of the population participating in - getting the most
democracy for the least effort.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have to admit I haven't had much time to look at MixedInk, but I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> given it a quick review in response to the last thread. I wanted to mention
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was the things we could learn from what MixedInk has done so far, good and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bad.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Collaborative Editing:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First is the obvious feature of collaborative editing, with revisions tied
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to authors. If I understand correctly, something somewhat similar is being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> built into Candiwi. It is especially great to be able to see each authors'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that it is very good. It is somehow sexy to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> actually see how a document is really the production of multiple
</I>&gt;<i> hands. I hope this way of doing catches up on wikimedia as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand I am always a bit unconvinced about systems where a
</I>&gt;<i> person can take decisions based on their trust, like and dislike about
</I>&gt;<i> other people. I like the idea to have to fend its own way toward the
</I>&gt;<i> top of visibility. I am afraid someone might censor something just
</I>&gt;<i> because someone has wrote it, or copy something else for the same
</I>&gt;<i> reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Information Overload:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A real drawback I see to MixedInk is the overwhelming amount of text one has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to delve through to properly evaluate a project. In addition to reading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through a potentially-long essay, one then might have to read through five,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ten, or a thousand different versions. It seems like only a few versions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would get much play, and only a few people would want to participate in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first place. This is evidenced by the rather low participation their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> big-visibility projects get.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with your analysis, but not necessarily with your solution.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a big problem and we had the same problem in Vilfredo (some
</I>&gt;<i> people not supporting some thing sjust because they could not be
</I>&gt;<i> bothered to read them all).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we are clashing against a real problem here. As we try to get
</I>&gt;<i> the idea to be at the center, instead of the people we are not allowed
</I>&gt;<i> anymore to trust one expert. Imagine if to decide the trial on the
</I>&gt;<i> shooting of JFK every person in the US had to read the full document
</I>&gt;<i> of the acts, and declaration from the trial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The solution to this overload, I think, is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to ask people how to transform the technology of the governments of Europe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or the United States, but rather to ask where a chess club should have its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> next tournament. A much, much smaller focus would increase participation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from a small group of people who really care, while simultaneously narrowing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the focus enough that there wouldn't be so many permutations. Once that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system is worked out, then it can scale up gradually and we'll see how it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure about this solution. There are plenty of systems that
</I>&gt;<i> only work at certain size and do not scale up. The idea of smoothing
</I>&gt;<i> it out at one size is good. And can be used to make it work better at
</I>&gt;<i> other sizes, but it will not make it necessarily scale better. It
</I>&gt;<i> seems a bit like cleaning a car to make it run faster. For that you
</I>&gt;<i> need to test it at other sizes, and since we have the luck of an
</I>&gt;<i> american president who is pro-e-government we should jump at this
</I>&gt;<i> occasion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what solution we could do?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we could consider a fully decentralized system.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I think better in terms of Vilfredo, but what I suggest can
</I>&gt;<i> also be applied to MixedInk and Candiwi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine if every person is given a random position in a (1d? 2d? 3d?)
</I>&gt;<i> space. Or maybe every person is just a node on a graph. A question is
</I>&gt;<i> asked and each person evaluates only the answer that reaches him/her.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a limited nmber, as he would be reached by the answers from
</I>&gt;<i> its neighbors (up to distance n, maybe that the user can define
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the amount of his free time). As solutions seem to
</I>&gt;<i> satisfy a local neighbors, they scale up, and reach bigger area. We
</I>&gt;<i> could even make some long distance links to make sure that the space
</I>&gt;<i> is a small world, so that each person can be reached by an idea after
</I>&gt;<i> few passages. The result of this would be that the person would still
</I>&gt;<i> have to evaluate only few info. Also he would have to partially trust
</I>&gt;<i> the others, but there would be no bottleneck of representatives that
</I>&gt;<i> chose for all the others. Also if the system is like Vilfredo an
</I>&gt;<i> answer could simply not go up if it isn't supported by a group, so
</I>&gt;<i> each person can act as a stopping point if they do not support a
</I>&gt;<i> possible answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Scoring Proposals:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I haven't looked too hard at how they use their scores (like is there any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drive toward consensus, like our idea of synthesis scoring?), but I do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notice that they do a 9-point system disguised as a 5-star system (by simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allowing for half-stars, but apparently not having a 0-star score). Their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scores are nicely translated too, as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0.5 - Worst. Ever.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.0 - Just plain awful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.5 - Firmly against it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.0 - Sorta against it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.5 - I could take it or leave it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.0 - Somewhat represents my view
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.5 - Pretty good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4.0 - Very well said
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4.5 - Amazing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5.0 - Best. Ever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm, I personally don't like every time someone take a 1 dimensional
</I>&gt;<i> thing, and try to give them meaning. Meanings are always
</I>&gt;<i> multidimensional. In any case what they are trying to do is to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure that people are somehow consistend in the way they vote. A better
</I>&gt;<i> way would be what they do at hotornot (hotornot.com). Here you vote
</I>&gt;<i> for how hot is a person. The votes are renormalised based on your past
</I>&gt;<i> votings, so if you only vote 4 and 5 stars then 4 means no and 5 means
</I>&gt;<i> yes. They can do this because you HAVE to vote for each girl they
</I>&gt;<i> present you. So there is no ignoring the rating option. I think the
</I>&gt;<i> way they do is fuly supported from a statistical point of view. I am
</I>&gt;<i> sure they renormalise the average of the votes. I suspect they also
</I>&gt;<i> renormalise the standard deviation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Closed Source:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Clearly the biggest drawback of MixedInk is that it is a closed source,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for-profit venture. Personally I see that as a critical flaw (in the context
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of democracy) simply because closed source is not audible (or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improvable/adaptable) and because democracy can't be run by a commercial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entity. Democracy must of course include and accommodate commercial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entities, but it doesn't make sense to have democratic institutions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> controlled by a single company.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> agreed, but is this so bad to not use it at all if we need to write up
</I>&gt;<i> something? We would use a Google tool, I think. It is common for tools
</I>&gt;<i> to be made first as closed source, and then as open source which
</I>&gt;<i> eventually catches up. Think about mindmanager and freemind. IE and
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox (ok ok the story is longer), ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something I want to add:
</I>&gt;<i> the idea of locality is a bit related with the idea of slashdot where
</I>&gt;<i> you are only allowed to vote every now and then. I remember rteading
</I>&gt;<i> that just having everybody voting for everybody did not work well.
</I>&gt;<i> People would help each other, and not be objective. Instead when
</I>&gt;<i> voting power became a scarce resource that could not be stored people
</I>&gt;<i> had to apply it there and then. No strategy. A bit like judges are not
</I>&gt;<i> (I think) allowed to chose what they judge. Although they can avoid
</I>&gt;<i> judging something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I could build up a system on Vilfredo where people instead of
</I>&gt;<i> voting are presented with a series of questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
