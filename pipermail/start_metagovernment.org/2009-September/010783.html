This is a clever approach. It is reminiscent of what I just saw on a  
beer-ratings site <A HREF="http://ratebeer.com">http://ratebeer.com</A> which does not count any place- 
ratings from a particular person until they have reviewed ten places.  
What you're proposing for draft2gether makes a lot of sense in an  
ongoing community, where new proposals will constantly emerge.

My only concern would be that it might encourage people to spew out  
random ratings just to get back to rating the item they are interested  
in. That would then degrade everything at once.

&gt;<i> Also, we thought about an algorithm that gets the length of a given  
</I>&gt;<i> amend/comment and calculates a number of seconds needed before the  
</I>&gt;<i> user is really allowed to rate it (ie.: based on configurable

</I>&gt;<i> . This could be a better approach in terms of usability. What do you  
</I>&gt;<i> think?

This sounds arbitrary and unlikely to be very effective. All a person  
has to do is wait until the button allows them to rate. They could be  
playing video games or talking on the phone for all you know. It makes  
me think of some websites where they don't let you click the &quot;Agree&quot;  
button on their terms-of-use until you scroll all the way to the  
bottom. Most people just immediately scroll all the way down (still  
without reading) and then click the Accept button.

Alternately, what if a person reads most of something but then has to  
log out for the day. They come back the next day, read the last bit  
they hadn't read yet, but then still can't rate because of a time limit?
