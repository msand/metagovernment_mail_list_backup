If they are truly interdependent, they could be tied together based on  
either mutual dependency (all must pass or else none do) or hierarchal  
dependency (if A.1 passes, then A.1.1 and A.1.2 come under review,  
containing further details of A.1). In the latter case, the top-level  
proposal is sort of like a resolution (we stand resolved that this  
should be done) and the latter proposals are like policies, flushing  
out the details of the resolution.

The nice thing about a length limit is that very often something very  
verbose can be stated much more succinctly if the author merely tries  
harder. I have noticed numerous times on Twitter where I wanted to say  
something much, much larger than the 140 character limit; but after  
careful thought and editing was able to easily fit into the limit.  
Often, in fact, my end statement was much more useful than the  
beginning one.

The end result is that a lot of work on the part of one author  
translates into a lot of saved time for every single reader... and  
much more likelihood that they will read it in the first place.
