<PRE>Hi, David.

I hope you don't mind that I'm replying on-list, but I think other  
people on the list might have more to say than do I. And generally, we  
prefer to do stuff on-list in the spirit of &quot;transparency in  
everything.&quot;

There are a few political parties which act along the lines you are  
describing. You may wish to contact them to see if they would want to  
offer direct experiences. The ones I know of are:
Australia: <A HREF="http://www.senatoronline.org.au/">http://www.senatoronline.org.au/</A>
Sweden: <A HREF="http://demoex.net/en/">http://demoex.net/en/</A>
USA: <A HREF="http://freegovernment.org/">http://freegovernment.org/</A> (site is down?)

I have invited the first two to this list, but have not heard back  
(would someone else like to try?) Foy Savas of FreeGovernment is  
already on this list, though usually inactive. I would think  
particularly the Australians would be helpful to you.

I don't think 2011 is too soon to get involved. I don't know anything  
about NZ politics, but my impression is that folks there are somewhat  
more politically active than the norm and may well be receptive to a  
more democratic proposition. And generally, social media trends can  
develop quite quickly, so if you have a good campaign, there is  
nothing to stop it from growing as much as possible.

But again, the above projects might have better ideas. I know  
SenatorOnline did not have enough time to have the impact they desired  
in 2007, but their window was very small.

My suggestion would be to structure big but target small. That is,  
target the local government in your town, but make a party structure  
that is amenable to taking on local (and larger) governments all over  
New Zealand. I believe that is how DemoEx did it, and they seem to be  
the most successful of all. But if you think it would be better to  
target the national parliament, then given the MMP structure, I guess  
you would have to try for a full-blown national campaign from the start.

For branding, well... my experience is with American politics, where  
all voters are assumed to be dumber than dirt, so campaigns are  
embarrassingly stupid. I just can't speak to what would work in New  
Zealand.

I hope this helps. Hopefully others will chime in with more helpful  
ideas.

</I>&gt;<i> on issues which are in front of parliament, then present those views  
</I>&gt;<i> to MPs on behalf of the members. If/when the party got voted in,  
</I>&gt;<i> then there is obviously a greater voice for the members and maybe  
</I>&gt;<i> they could present their own issues to. I would hope to appeal to  
</I>&gt;<i> younger voters, the politically disenfranchised/unegaged, anyone who  
</I>&gt;<i> wants to have there voice heard. The intention is for the party to

</I>&gt;<i> issues individually making recommendations based on what the members  
</I>&gt;<i> want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me the above idea seems so simple and positive, I can't imagine  
</I>&gt;<i> why it wouldn't be successful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll keep perusing the site, but if you or any of your members have

</I>&gt;<i> be very interested to hear. In fact it would be great if you could  
</I>&gt;<i> email this around to the group in case anyone is able to assist with  
</I>&gt;<i> ideas. I joined your &quot;start&quot; mailing list already and have had a few  
</I>&gt;<i> of the emails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just a private individual with an idea and a family to support&#8212; 
</I>&gt;<i> so a VERY limited budget but lots of enthusiasm. I intend to use  
</I>&gt;<i> Yola to make and host my website at least initially to keep costs  
</I>&gt;<i> down. I consider myself to be quite smart and logical but have no  
</I>&gt;<i> political training or experience. To me that should not hold a  
</I>&gt;<i> person back from being involved. My background is in Supply Chain,  
</I>&gt;<i> most recently Demand Planning which entails determining  
</I>&gt;<i> statistically what people want and where and planning the resources  
</I>&gt;<i> to make it happen, kind of fitting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some questions are: What name/ branding/ advertising would be most  
</I>&gt;<i> effective in gaining support? Simple or complex methodologies? I  
</I>&gt;<i> think simple would have wider appeal but not sure. Is it realistic  
</I>&gt;<i> to contest the next election which is in 2011? I want to keep it  
</I>&gt;<i> simple and manageable for a start, not try and bite off more than I  
</I>&gt;<i> can chew.
</I>&gt;<i> cheers
