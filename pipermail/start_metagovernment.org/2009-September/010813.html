<PRE>I converted the 16 &#147;Big Ideas&#148; identified in Google&#146;s Project 10^100,
together with the suggestions that inspired them, into StratML format at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other</A> or, more specifically,
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/P10%5E100.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/P10%5E100.xml</A> 

 

Personally, I don&#146;t care to see any more of the proposals.  What I do look
forward to seeing are *performance plans* for turning some (a few) of them
into effective action.  (Good ideas are a dime a dozen.  What is rare and,
thus, valuable are good implementations, and good implementations require
good plans.)

 

While I have voted for several of the 16 &#147;ideas,&#148; I do not believe it is my
vote or anyone else&#146;s vote that truly matters but, rather, whether we are
willing and able to contribute the inputs and efforts (processes) required
to produce the outputs required to realize the desired outcomes -- which
should be specified in measurable terms against which progress should be
reported on the Web.

 

The $10 million that Google has allocated to this project could generate
greatly magnified returns if it succeeds in engaging thousands, if not
millions of us in contributing to the realization of objectives that we feel
are worthy of our time, effort, money, and other resources.

 

In my view, the best way to begin to enable more effective collective action
is for each of us to identify our respective goals and objectives in open,
standard, nonproprietary format (like StratML) on the Web. 

 

To the degree that may be true, it would be good if Google were willing and
able to: 

 

a) support the specification of Part 2 of the StratML standard, which will
contain the elements of performance plans and reports, and 

 

b) demonstrate leadership in implementing the StratML standard in support of
Project 10^100 as well as myriad other goals and objectives toward whose
realization millions of individuals and organizations worldwide may be more
than willing to collectively contribute. 

 

It would be a shame if the best Google can do with its tremendous resources
is to conduct more &#147;business as usual&#148; &#150; under which RFP&#146;s commonly result
in exclusive relationships leading to more or less closed, proprietary
applications developed by &#147;the organization(s) that are best suited to
implementing them.&#148;

Subject: Re: [Start] Fwd: Project 10^100: Reminder to vote

 

Thanks Matias. 

I have just read the proposals.

So they claim they received 154.000 proposals. And now they present us with
16, each which was generated by 4 or 5. 16*5=80. I wonder what the other
153.920 were.
They could not all be duplicates! I wish there was more transparency here.
In the FAQ they explain:  each of the 16 big ideas represents several
hundred user-submitted ideas

Let's us speak of course of the one that we are here to discuss: the
government watch proposal.


1.     Make government more transparent 


Community

Create a website that enables people from any country or municipality to
easily learn about the workings of their government, and rally their fellow
citizens to take action to improve it. Numerous user ideas embraced
variations on the theme of governmental transparency, with specific
proposals ranging from publishing details of proposed laws and politicians'
voting records to making public budgets searchable online and leveraging
social networks to let communities make their voices heard by their
representatives by voting on pressing issues.

2.	Suggestions that inspired this idea:

1.	Create a &quot;govwatch&quot; program that allows people to enter in
geographic and other info and get back information about bills/laws that
affect them
2.	Empower individual voters with both online, real-time data on their
political representatives' activity, and tools to analyze, engage and
influence outcomes
3.	Increase the transparency of laws, eliminate duplicate ones and
communicate them better to affected citizens
4.	Share information on how municipalities and states use public funds



I am really not convinced by it at all.

First of all it seems the kind of idea that would work only in some places
and not in others. I found the same problems in many proposals. Since they
speak about reviewing the proposals in terms of 
Reach: How many people would this idea affect?
Depth: How deeply are people impacted? How urgent is the need?
Attainability: Can this idea be implemented within a year or two?
Efficiency: How simple and cost-effective is your idea?
Longevity: How long will the idea's impact last?

They should have included what their expected reach should be. is this
project going to work only in the US? In the US and Europe? Everywhere?
Every real democratic country? Every democratic country, even if the
democracy is just a fraud (see Iran for a recent example). 

Secondly I am unsatisfied with the vision of this. I think it is quite
shallow. Has anyone from here presented our key idea: 
develop a website that permit to a group of people to self govern.
Independently of the size. Including software that help merge different
ideas.

If we did what happened to this idea? Because for sure this is the only
proposal going in that direction, and for sure it does not cover that idea.



Can anyone convince me that I am wrong, before I post my vote for another
idea?

Many thanks,
Pietro

Hello everyone,

It's time to vote!

Last year, Project &lt;<A HREF="http://www.project10tothe100.com">http://www.project10tothe100.com</A>&gt;  10^100 invited the
world to submit ideas to help as many people as possible. We received over
154,000 submissions, which we narrowed down to our favorites.

Now, you're invited to view the ideas
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.project10tothe100.com/vote.html">http://www.project10tothe100.com/vote.html</A>&gt;  and vote for the ones you
think will help the &lt;<A HREF="http://www.project10tothe100.com/why.html">http://www.project10tothe100.com/why.html</A>&gt;  most
people.

Our advisory board will use your votes to identify the best ideas for
further consideration, and we've committed $10 million to make up to 5 of
them a reality.

Hurry, voting ends October 8, 2009.

Thanks for your help. Please vote! And may those who help the most win.
