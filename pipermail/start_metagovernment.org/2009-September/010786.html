<PRE>Hi Ed,

&gt;&gt;<i> In those projects they took a statistically representative sample of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the population.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's a statistically representative sample, then isn't it necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;representative&quot; democracy? :)
</I>
In a different way:
When the population vote they don't vote people similar to them. This
is why the senate, and the camera are not samples of the population.
Women are underrepresented, as are poor people and people from racial
minorities.
Also as working in the senate is a full time job, people soon forget
where they were coming from, as they identify with their new role.

The idea behind representative democracy is to find the best people
that represent everybody.
But if you are going to train those people, then you don't need to
select on knowledge, but can select on the fact that they really
represent the populations statistically.

It is a different system

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not sure I would agree that my distributed solution is so based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on representatives. Yes, the idea is that a person would vote on some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answers, but also that as soon as an answer is succesful it would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evalued by more and more. Still an answer to be accepted by the whole
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community would need to be voted by everybody. This would happen in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> steps. In other words there are some answers that simply do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deserve being read too far. If we are speaking about abortion, a silly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer would be &quot;let us roll a dice, and we permit an abortion if it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comes out a 6&quot;. It doesn't really deserve that much attention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This does seem to make sense. I would just add that people should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> read the other stuff (that which is not filtered to them) at any time, if
</I>&gt;<i> they so choose. That way, there can be a filtering through a small group,
</I>&gt;<i> but others can chime in at any time and notice the value of something that
</I>&gt;<i> the original filters may have missed.
</I>

Agreed


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the side of all this, I am perplexed. Some issues just do not lend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves easily to be too compressed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a proposal doesn't fit in a text-limit, then maybe it should be broken up
</I>&gt;<i> into multiple proposals.
</I>
This is a non trivial.
What if proposal A.2 is only possible with A.1,
but people agree to A.2 but not on A.1?
