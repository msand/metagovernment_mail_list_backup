<PRE>Hello,

This is my first post to this list (or maybe 2nd, due to administrative 
issues), which I've been monitoring for a couple of weeks or so.

I'll introduce myself as someone who's been involved in the &quot;civic 
software&quot; space for about 2 1/2 years. I've been especially focused on 
building and operating a ranked choice voting system that's 
distinguished by an interactive ballot and a rich visual display of results.

This tool is part of a much grander vision for scalable democratic 
engagement online. I'd be happy to present that vision in more detail 
later on, but it's worth mentioning that a key principle is something I 
call &quot;coalescent bubbling.&quot;  The goal is to help facilitate debate and 
decision-making processes in venues where multiple attractive ideas 
(even thousands of them) are being raised for consideration.

For now, I'd like to invite the folks here use it to rank your choices 
(unofficially, of course), for the Google 10^100 project.  It's at 
<A HREF="http://apps.facebook.com/we-vote/">http://apps.facebook.com/we-vote/</A>

Please try it out, and please invite others.

thanks,

Craig Simon
