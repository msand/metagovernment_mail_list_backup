<PRE>Dave, if you'd care to share it, I may wish to convert your plan to StratML
format for inclusion in our collection at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other</A> 

 

BTW, Ed et al., here's another interesting site:
<A HREF="http://beyondvoting.wikia.com/wiki/Beyond_Voting">http://beyondvoting.wikia.com/wiki/Beyond_Voting</A>  While I can't say that it
appears they have an actual plan, they do have a vision and it might be good
to try to engage them.

Hi, David.

 

I hope you don't mind that I'm replying on-list, but I think other people on
the list might have more to say than do I. And generally, we prefer to do
stuff on-list in the spirit of &quot;transparency in everything.&quot;

 

There are a few political parties which act along the lines you are
describing. You may wish to contact them to see if they would want to offer
direct experiences. The ones I know of are:

Australia: <A HREF="http://www.senatoronline.org.au/">http://www.senatoronline.org.au/</A>

Sweden: <A HREF="http://demoex.net/en/">http://demoex.net/en/</A>

USA: <A HREF="http://freegovernment.org/">http://freegovernment.org/</A> (site is down?)

 

I have invited the first two to this list, but have not heard back (would
someone else like to try?) Foy Savas of FreeGovernment is already on this
list, though usually inactive. I would think particularly the Australians
would be helpful to you.

 

I don't think 2011 is too soon to get involved. I don't know anything about
NZ politics, but my impression is that folks there are somewhat more
politically active than the norm and may well be receptive to a more
democratic proposition. And generally, social media trends can develop quite
quickly, so if you have a good campaign, there is nothing to stop it from
growing as much as possible. 

 

But again, the above projects might have better ideas. I know SenatorOnline
did not have enough time to have the impact they desired in 2007, but their
window was very small.

 

My suggestion would be to structure big but target small. That is, target
the local government in your town, but make a party structure that is
amenable to taking on local (and larger) governments all over New Zealand. I
believe that is how DemoEx did it, and they seem to be the most successful
of all. But if you think it would be better to target the national
parliament, then given the MMP structure, I guess you would have to try for
a full-blown national campaign from the start.

 

For branding, well... my experience is with American politics, where all
voters are assumed to be dumber than dirt, so campaigns are embarrassingly
stupid. I just can't speak to what would work in New Zealand.

 

I hope this helps. Hopefully others will chime in with more helpful ideas.

Hi Ed,
I live in New Zealand and have a strong interest in politics and
specifically better forms of democracy. I read your introduction page &amp;
various comments on the metagovt site, and I would say I concur with your
ideology.

In New Zealand we have an &quot;MMP&quot; system, mixed member proportional, part of
which means a party needs a minimum of 5% of the vote to get seats in
parliament, which for our voting population is around 120,000 votes which
gets you 6 seats in a 120 seat parliament.

I have been working on a plan for some time to start a party, the basis of
which is to use the internet to guage the members' opinions on issues which
are in front of parliament, then present those views to MPs on behalf of the
members. If/when the party got voted in, then there is obviously a greater
voice for the members and maybe they could present their own issues to. I
would hope to appeal to younger voters, the politically
disenfranchised/unegaged, anyone who wants to have there voice heard. The
intention is for the party to be non-partisan (I realise that's an
oxymoron!) but rather look at issues individually making recommendations
based on what the members want.

To me the above idea seems so simple and positive, I can't imagine why it
wouldn't be successful.

I'll keep perusing the site, but if you or any of your members have any
pointers/ suggestions/ reasons why it wouldn't work etc, I would be very
interested to hear. In fact it would be great if you could email this around
to the group in case anyone is able to assist with ideas. I joined your
&quot;start&quot; mailing list already and have had a few of the emails.

I'm just a private individual with an idea and a family to support-so a VERY
limited budget but lots of enthusiasm. I intend to use Yola to make and host
my website at least initially to keep costs down. I consider myself to be
quite smart and logical but have no political training or experience. To me
that should not hold a person back from being involved. My background is in
Supply Chain, most recently Demand Planning which entails determining
statistically what people want and where and planning the resources to make
it happen, kind of fitting.

Some questions are: What name/ branding/ advertising would be most effective
in gaining support? Simple or complex methodologies? I think simple would
have wider appeal but not sure. Is it realistic to contest the next election
which is in 2011? I want to keep it simple and manageable for a start, not
try and bite off more than I can chew.
cheers
Dave
