<PRE>Ed, one of the books I read years ago while working on Capitol Hill was
Getting to Yes.  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_to_YES">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_to_YES</A>  

One of the methods of negotiations highlighted in the book is called the
&quot;single text&quot; --
<A HREF="http://crinfo.beyondintractability.org/essay/single-text_negotiation/?nid=65">http://crinfo.beyondintractability.org/essay/single-text_negotiation/?nid=65</A>
60 -- which, of course, is the method that Congress uses through the
introduction of &quot;bills&quot;.

Since all MCs have sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution, presumably,
it provides the basis in terms of values upon which legislative negotiations
begin.  However, in other types of negotiations, it may be helpful, if not
essential first to establish consensus on the values (basic principles) upon
which the parties agree.  Of course, too, to the degree the negotiations are
to achieve meaningful outcomes, it is also necessary to ensure that all of
the relevant stakeholders are engaged.

While the emerging StratML standard will not guarantee those requirements
are met, it will enable documentation of the values and stakeholders that
have been identified.  It will also support the distinction you are drawing
between more general (first stage) versus more specific (subsequent stage)
&quot;proposals&quot; -- in terms of strategic plans versus performance plans.

Note also that in the context of legal authorities, legislation (laws) are
routinely rendered more specific in regulations issued by the agencies
charged with implementing them. Presumably, President Obama's directive on
openness, transparency, participation, and collaboration will lead to
greater public engagement in providing input and feedback on proposed
regulations, hopefully, through better means than Federal Register notices
and <A HREF="http://www.regulations.gov/">http://www.regulations.gov/</A>

Subject: [Start] Walls of Text - Software analogy for code development

I happened to be reading some legislation and realized that sometimes  
extreme detail is in fact necessary. For example, this was specifying  
that people had one year to file a form, then went into detail about  
what precisely was meant by one year in this case. A reasonable  
specification.

So anyway, it occurs to me that this is a good opportunity to return  
to the analogy between a code of laws and software code. When  
developing code, programmers don't (or shouldn't) just jump in and  
start developing the finished product. Instead, they (and often other  
involved parties) sit down and decide on the requirements.

So can't laws be developed in the same way? All we would need is a two  
(or more) stage system. General proposals are made in the first stage,  
and if a general proposal garners a consensus, then people can propose  
the details of how to flush it out in the second stage. If no second  
stage proposal wins, the process resets.

These stages might even require very different processes. For example,  
something like NationBuilder or Vilfredo would work well for the first  
stage, but something like Draft2Gether or MixedInk would work better  
for the second stage.
