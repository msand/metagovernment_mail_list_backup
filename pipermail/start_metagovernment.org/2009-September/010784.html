I'm afraid this conversation itself may be a wall of text, so I'll try  
to be very brief. No, I didn't make it up; not sure where I've seen  
it. But it certainly seems appropriate both literally and  
metaphorically.

&gt;<i> In those projects they took a statistically representative sample of
</I>&gt;<i> the population.
</I>
If it's a statistically representative sample, then isn't it  
necessarily &quot;representative&quot; democracy? :)

&gt;<i> I am not sure I would agree that my distributed solution is so based
</I>&gt;<i> on representatives. Yes, the idea is that a person would vote on some
</I>&gt;<i> answers, but also that as soon as an answer is succesful it would be

</I>&gt;<i> community would need to be voted by everybody. This would happen in
</I>&gt;<i> steps. In other words there are some answers that simply do not
</I>&gt;<i> deserve being read too far. If we are speaking about abortion, a silly
</I>&gt;<i> answer would be &quot;let us roll a dice, and we permit an abortion if it
</I>&gt;<i> comes out a 6&quot;. It doesn't really deserve that much attention.
</I>
This does seem to make sense. I would just add that people should be  
able to read the other stuff (that which is not filtered to them) at  
any time, if they so choose. That way, there can be a filtering  
through a small group, but others can chime in at any time and notice  
the value of something that the original filters may have missed.

&gt;<i> On the side of all this, I am perplexed. Some issues just do not lend
</I>&gt;<i> themselves easily to be too compressed.
</I>
If a proposal doesn't fit in a text-limit, then maybe it should be  
broken up into multiple proposals.
