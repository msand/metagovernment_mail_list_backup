<PRE>Hello,
I am back from the conference of artificial life.
There I presented the algorithm of Vilfredo.

As I promised now the paper is available for all at
<A HREF="http://publications.pietrosperoni.it/SA2009ecal.pdf">http://publications.pietrosperoni.it/SA2009ecal.pdf</A>

And if you need to reference it you can use:
-Pietro Speroni di Fenizio, Chris Anderson, (2009) Using Pareto Front
for a Consensus Building, Human Based, Genetic Algorithm Proc.
European Conference on Artificial Life (ECAL 2009), LNCS, Springer,
Berlin, (in print).
Infact I would ask, if you are using the Vilfredo algorithm for human
based genetic algorithm that you do refer to it (in your papers or at
least in your website)

In the following link I shall start to update the website. Now there
is really nothing holding it back from being open source.  Also I
intend to make a wiki page with the future possibilities of the
website.

At the conference I had only a poster and no talk, as such I could not
get much attention on the project. Nevertheless I found some interest
in a couple of collegues.

One of them Jason Noble (in CC), was very excited about it. Jason is
in the elected comitee for the artificial life society and was
considering the idea of suggesting to use Vilfredo for decisions over
there. My suggestion was to modify it so that for now everybody was
allowed to suggest an answer, but only the representatives could vote.
This to make sure that the result is still in line with the
organizational structure of the AL society. Jason is based in the UK,
and I will soon visit him. He knew about the Pareto front (he use to
teach it as a way to solve genetic algorithm himself) so he really
catched up quickly.

Another collegue that showed some real interest is a professor friend
of mine, Mark Bedau (not in CC). He is a philosopher on epistemology.
He is very pragmatic and I like the very down to earth way in which he
presents his ideas. I don't often understand philosopher when they
speak, but with Mark the situation is totally different. So Mark is
now interested in ethics of science and how technology is changing
society. He only could come for one day, as there was another
conference just on this topic in the UK.  As we organise our
conference, if we want it to have academic relevance we will need an
external review board. A series of people who are not part of the
group, with high outstanding position recognised by the academic world
that can suggest us and give us their ok. If you look at conferences
they pretty much all have this. Those are not the reviewer of the
papers, but people who will review the whole process to certify that
we have followed the highest standards (example, no cheating on peer
review papers, etc). I will suggest Mark as a person for this role
when the times come.

Cheers,
Pietro
