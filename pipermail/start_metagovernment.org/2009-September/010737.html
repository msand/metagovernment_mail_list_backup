<PRE>Ed, as one who seldom takes the time to view videos on the Web, I must say
that it is kinda refreshing to see one that is only 30 seconds long ... and
isn't just a pretty face (talking head).  You do a pretty good job of
packing a lot of info into that limited amount of time.  (I'd give it 4
stars but that would require me to create a YouTube account, which I'm not
sufficiently motivated to do at this point.)

Subject: [Start] 30-second Government 2.0 presentations

As part of the overpriced, exclusive (i.e., not inclusive) Government  
2.0 Summit which Pietro mentioned previously, O'Reilly posted a call  
for presentations about &quot;What Does Government 2.0 Mean To You?&quot;
<A HREF="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/08/what-does-government-20-mean-to-you.html">http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/08/what-does-government-20-mean-to-you.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.gov2summit.com/gov2009/public/content/gov2-video">http://www.gov2summit.com/gov2009/public/content/gov2-video</A>

The format is a 30-second video, which is a sort of insulting  
restriction. O'Reilly promotes the 5-minute &quot;Ignite&quot; presentations,  
which are great. But 30 seconds? How much can one say in that much  
time? (And O'Reilly has his own video on that page... which is 4  
minutes long.)

Well, I figured I'd have a go at it anyway. The deadline on his blog  
post is today, so I stormed through what turned out to be a rather  
silly video (but I got bored with seeing men talking, and also I hate  
the sound of my recorded voice). I then noticed that the second link  
above has a deadline of September 7. Oh well. I'll stick with what I  
already posted, but you all are welcome to make your own.

Enjoy:
