<PRE>Hi Folks.


Ed this is a good point, (laws: if not open to edit then how), i might
propose that rather than conceptualizing a project as having multiple
phases one might see it as multiple concentric circles of access to
the root or primary text, with continuous feedback loops between the
core and periphery.


Linear phases leaves open a far too real problem that the final stages
and participants in the development ignore the consensus of previous
stages and slam in big fat slabs of pork.


The use and utility of &quot;debate by edit&quot; in a wiki is really robust if
people can adjust to the cultural norms required. I think it can work
standalone for small groups. But, it wouldn't work as a standalone for
mass particpation drafting laws.

Robust, centralized, open, strictly version controlled primary text
should be the backbone of the process. Do we agree on this?


At the core you would have a group of &quot;superusers&quot; persons or entities
who may or may not all be legislators. I can't see a wikified
legislature without bureaucrats and sysops can you? These people
primarily need to function like paperweights - holding down sections
of text that have been agreed on.


One ring outside of that, you could have multiple instances of the
same text, an instance for each interest group. these interest groups
would choose settings to &quot;see&quot; or &quot;ignore&quot; changes by other instances
of same text - giving the ability to propose amendments which can be
championed by some superusers as actual amendments.

A ring outside of that you have something akin to focus group testing,
open to casual participation - which can be an online version of
almost any type of facilitated consultation or visioning process. (the
wall of sticky notes, seconding or retweeting IM's, mission vision
strategy tactics)

</I>&gt;<i> [mailto:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start-bounces at metagovernment.org</A>] On Behalf Of Ed Pastore
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Thursday, September 24, 2009 9:53 PM
</I>&gt;<i> To: Metagovernment Startup Committee
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Start] Walls of Text - Software analogy for code development
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I happened to be reading some legislation and realized that sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> extreme detail is in fact necessary. For example, this was specifying
</I>&gt;<i> that people had one year to file a form, then went into detail about
</I>&gt;<i> what precisely was meant by one year in this case. A reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> specification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So anyway, it occurs to me that this is a good opportunity to return
</I>&gt;<i> to the analogy between a code of laws and software code. When
</I>&gt;<i> developing code, programmers don't (or shouldn't) just jump in and
</I>&gt;<i> start developing the finished product. Instead, they (and often other
</I>&gt;<i> involved parties) sit down and decide on the requirements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So can't laws be developed in the same way? All we would need is a two
</I>&gt;<i> (or more) stage system. General proposals are made in the first stage,
</I>&gt;<i> and if a general proposal garners a consensus, then people can propose
</I>&gt;<i> the details of how to flush it out in the second stage. If no second
</I>&gt;<i> stage proposal wins, the process resets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These stages might even require very different processes. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> something like NationBuilder or Vilfredo would work well for the first
</I>&gt;<i> stage, but something like Draft2Gether or MixedInk would work better
</I>&gt;<i> for the second stage.
