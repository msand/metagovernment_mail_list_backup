<PRE>Hi Michael,
while I really like Ed idea of a two parts process, I am less convinced by
this idea of the concentric circles.

It feels like the people in the center are the ones who have the real power.

While in the two stage process you would have the people setting up the
spirit of the law. Then they might ask for people to write down a set of
laws that satisfy that. Each group might produce a different outcome. Then a
final (winner take it all) voting among them might decide which of the
various legislations works. Or even better, everybody can vote on each of
the legislations that are suggested.

Provided that each of them satisfy the spirit of the law defined before.

Somehow in this way the power would be more on the hands of the people, and
the technicians wouldn't have a lot of responsability/power because they
just cannot write something that does not satisfy the spirit of the law.

Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Ed this is a good point, (laws: if not open to edit then how), i might
</I>&gt;<i> propose that rather than conceptualizing a project as having multiple
</I>&gt;<i> phases one might see it as multiple concentric circles of access to
</I>&gt;<i> the root or primary text, with continuous feedback loops between the
</I>&gt;<i> core and periphery.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Linear phases leaves open a far too real problem that the final stages
</I>&gt;<i> and participants in the development ignore the consensus of previous
</I>&gt;<i> stages and slam in big fat slabs of pork.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The use and utility of &quot;debate by edit&quot; in a wiki is really robust if
</I>&gt;<i> people can adjust to the cultural norms required. I think it can work
</I>&gt;<i> standalone for small groups. But, it wouldn't work as a standalone for
</I>&gt;<i> mass particpation drafting laws.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Robust, centralized, open, strictly version controlled primary text
</I>&gt;<i> should be the backbone of the process. Do we agree on this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the core you would have a group of &quot;superusers&quot; persons or entities
</I>&gt;<i> who may or may not all be legislators. I can't see a wikified
</I>&gt;<i> legislature without bureaucrats and sysops can you? These people
</I>&gt;<i> primarily need to function like paperweights - holding down sections
</I>&gt;<i> of text that have been agreed on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One ring outside of that, you could have multiple instances of the
</I>&gt;<i> same text, an instance for each interest group. these interest groups
</I>&gt;<i> would choose settings to &quot;see&quot; or &quot;ignore&quot; changes by other instances
</I>&gt;<i> of same text - giving the ability to propose amendments which can be
</I>&gt;<i> championed by some superusers as actual amendments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A ring outside of that you have something akin to focus group testing,
</I>&gt;<i> open to casual participation - which can be an online version of
</I>&gt;<i> almost any type of facilitated consultation or visioning process. (the
</I>&gt;<i> wall of sticky notes, seconding or retweeting IM's, mission vision
</I>&gt;<i> strategy tactics)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of the methods of negotiations highlighted in the book is called the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; introduction of &quot;bills&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since all MCs have sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution,
</I>&gt;<i> presumably,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it provides the basis in terms of values upon which legislative
</I>&gt;<i> negotiations
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; begin.  However, in other types of negotiations, it may be helpful, if
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; essential first to establish consensus on the values (basic principles)
</I>&gt;<i> upon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which the parties agree.  Of course, too, to the degree the negotiations
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to achieve meaningful outcomes, it is also necessary to ensure that all
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the relevant stakeholders are engaged.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While the emerging StratML standard will not guarantee those requirements
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are met, it will enable documentation of the values and stakeholders that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have been identified.  It will also support the distinction you are
</I>&gt;<i> drawing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between more general (first stage) versus more specific (subsequent
</I>&gt;<i> stage)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;proposals&quot; -- in terms of strategic plans versus performance plans.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note also that in the context of legal authorities, legislation (laws)
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; routinely rendered more specific in regulations issued by the agencies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; charged with implementing them. Presumably, President Obama's directive
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; openness, transparency, participation, and collaboration will lead to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; greater public engagement in providing input and feedback on proposed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regulations, hopefully, through better means than Federal Register
</I>&gt;<i> notices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and <A HREF="http://www.regulations.gov/">http://www.regulations.gov/</A>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [mailto:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start-bounces at metagovernment.org</A>] On Behalf Of Ed Pastore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sent: Thursday, September 24, 2009 9:53 PM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To: Metagovernment Startup Committee
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subject: [Start] Walls of Text - Software analogy for code development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I happened to be reading some legislation and realized that sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extreme detail is in fact necessary. For example, this was specifying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that people had one year to file a form, then went into detail about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what precisely was meant by one year in this case. A reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specification.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So anyway, it occurs to me that this is a good opportunity to return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the analogy between a code of laws and software code. When
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developing code, programmers don't (or shouldn't) just jump in and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start developing the finished product. Instead, they (and often other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; involved parties) sit down and decide on the requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So can't laws be developed in the same way? All we would need is a two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (or more) stage system. General proposals are made in the first stage,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and if a general proposal garners a consensus, then people can propose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the details of how to flush it out in the second stage. If no second
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stage proposal wins, the process resets.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These stages might even require very different processes. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like NationBuilder or Vilfredo would work well for the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stage, but something like Draft2Gether or MixedInk would work better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the second stage.
