<PRE>Thanks Matias.

I have just read the proposals.

So they claim they received 154.000 proposals. And now they present us with
16, each which was generated by 4 or 5. 16*5=80. I wonder what the other
153.920 were.
They could not all be duplicates! I wish there was more transparency here.
In the FAQ they explain:  each of the 16 big ideas represents several
hundred user-submitted ideas

Let's us speak of course of the one that we are here to discuss: the
government watch proposal.


   1. Make government more transparent

   Community

   Create a website that enables people from any country or municipality to
   easily learn about the workings of their government, and rally their fellow
   citizens to take action to improve it. Numerous user ideas embraced
   variations on the theme of governmental transparency, with specific
   proposals ranging from publishing details of proposed laws and politicians'
   voting records to making public budgets searchable online and leveraging
   social networks to let communities make their voices heard by their
   representatives by voting on pressing issues.
   2. Suggestions that inspired this idea:

   1. Create a &quot;govwatch&quot; program that allows people to enter in geographic
      and other info and get back information about bills/laws that affect them
      2. Empower individual voters with both online, real-time data on their
      political representatives' activity, and tools to analyze, engage and
      influence outcomes
      3. Increase the transparency of laws, eliminate duplicate ones and
      communicate them better to affected citizens
      4. Share information on how municipalities and states use public funds



I am really not convinced by it at all.

First of all it seems the kind of idea that would work only in some places
and not in others. I found the same problems in many proposals. Since they
speak about reviewing the proposals in terms of *
Reach:* How many people would this idea affect?
*Depth:* How deeply are people impacted? How urgent is the need?
*Attainability:* Can this idea be implemented within a year or two?
*Efficiency:* How simple and cost-effective is your idea?
*Longevity:* How long will the idea's impact last?

They should have included what their expected reach should be. is this
project going to work only in the US? In the US and Europe? Everywhere?
Every real democratic country? Every democratic country, even if the
democracy is just a fraud (see Iran for a recent example).

Secondly I am unsatisfied with the vision of this. I think it is quite
shallow. Has anyone from here presented our key idea:
develop a website that permit to a group of people to self govern.
Independently of the size. Including software that help merge different
ideas.

If we did what happened to this idea? Because for sure this is the only
proposal going in that direction, and for sure it does not cover that idea.



Can anyone convince me that I am wrong, before I post my vote for another
idea?

Many thanks,
Pietro
