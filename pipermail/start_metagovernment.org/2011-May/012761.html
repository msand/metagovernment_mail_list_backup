<PRE>Here has been talk of wether or not our tools can, should or would be 
used inside metagov.

The matter of fact is: they have been used already and even sucsessfully 
used! Look at the Metaquestion for Metagovernment thread!

So I do agree with Alexander on this.
But nevertheless I also agree with Mike and Conseo, that it would give a 
boost to the whole thing, if several communities were involved in a 
consensus-finding-effort and if they would know of each other. I mean, 
the whole crossforum-design was inspired by this idea, wasnt it?

So I agree with you plan (and its details), Mike, but would also work on 
the metagov-hompepage for instance.

I didnt picture a seperate community-space map, just a headline over 
each speech-bubble from which forum/community it comes. But I admit a 
seperate map for that sounds compelling.

I feel that Metagov would be the natural home of this outfit.
