Just by saying it.  &quot;We are unhappy with these particular details.&quot;
Or, &quot;We think *this* general aspect ought to be taken into account.&quot;
If that's what people agree to, then why not say it?

</I>
A rule of thumb is not enforced, however.  It is only an guideline for
those who find it useful.  Others are free to ignore it.

We might define the &quot;wall shattering impact&quot; of a consensus draft as
the number of votes divided by the number of words.  Recently I've
been wondering if something might be made of this hypothesis:

  The speed of growth of a consensus is proportional to the wall
  shattering impact of its draft.  Impact affects voter recruitment
  more than attrition, so the net rate of growth for high impact
  drafts generally exceeds that for low impact ones, mutatis mutandis.

I don't know if that's true, but it's interesting to consider.  One
mechanism that might contribute to it is illustrated by these 3
drafts:

     Let's build a sandbox     Let's build a sandbox
       and paint it red.         and paint it blue.

                  Let's build a sandbox
                      and paint it.

Call this &quot;consensus by erasure&quot;.  Erasure here produces a draft that
is not only smaller than the others but also more general and
therefore potentially more accomodating to a larger consensus.  How
exactly that potential would be realized, I don't know.  It only seems
that if people actually do agree - as obviously they do here - then
there ought to be a draft to give that agreement expression and form.
If people don't vote for it, then something's wrong, especially as we
allow them to cascade their votes into consensus like this:

     Let's build a sandbox     Let's build a sandbox
       and paint it red.         and paint it blue.

                   \                /
                    \              /

                  Let's build a sandbox
                      and paint it.

We sometimes say &quot;build consensus&quot;, but maybe consensus is not a thing
that can be built by piling material on material.  Maybe it's quite
the opposite - something that must literally be discovered by removing
material that overburdens and obscures it.  If agreement is the place
where our understandings and intentions overlap, then won't it always
be a smaller place than the one occupied by our disagreements?
Disagreement is so cheap and easy to manufacture that it can be piled
up to any height; wheras agreement is tightly constrained by reason
and rationality, and can never be forced or fabricated.

Thoughts like these lead me to suspect that smaller is better.
