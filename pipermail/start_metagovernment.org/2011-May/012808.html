Hi all,I have received the below mail from Ed and I reply to 
this in public, as asked by Ed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&#160;
Concerning 
forum integration, there are three issues. OpenID is important, but the toughest 
issue is integrating the new forum with the existing list server. The third 
issue is choosing which forum to use.


If 
it is logistically impractical to use a different forum, then we'll have to use 
phpBB. But phpBB is fairly primitive, and I would really prefer to use a more 
robust (but still open source) forum such as MyBB.


Supposing 
we use MyBB, then the main issue is figuring out how to do two-directional 
communication between the list (which is operated by Mailman software) and the 
forum. Bi-directional means:


1. 
Any new thread in the list shows up as a new topic in one category of the 
forum.


2. 
Any reply on the list shows up as a reply to the associated forum post.


3. 
Any new topic on the forum shows up as a new thread on the list.


4. 
Any reply on the forum shows up as a reply (ie, with a re:) on the list.


It 
is possible the M2F can help with this
<A HREF="http://mail2forum.com/v20-development/">http://mail2forum.com/v20-development/</A>
but 
it is in Alpha. Still it might be a good codebase to start with. They do a good 
description of how it should work as well:
<A HREF="http://mail2forum.com/v20-development/m2f-20-design/m2f-20-threading-uses-cases/">http://mail2forum.com/v20-development/m2f-20-design/m2f-20-threading-uses-cases/</A>


Then 
there is the issue of OpenID integration. That is relatively straight-forward. I 
would prefer to only allow people to subscribe to the list with an OpenID login. 
The forum doesn't have to be an OpenID server, it can just be a client, where 
people set up an OpenID somewhere else. If we use MyBB, there is an OpenID 
module already built:
<A HREF="http://mods.mybb.com/reviews/openid">http://mods.mybb.com/reviews/openid</A>
but 
I have not checked to see if it is really functional.


As 
you can see, this is a tricky set of requirements, and they are all in flux. I 
posted a question to the Mailman list to see if the people there have experience 
with this sort of thing to give us some advice, but I have not heard back 
yet.


If 
we do end up having&#160;Sandesh&#160;or 
someone program this, it would also be nice if they would be willing to 
contribute their code back to the relevant projects so that others could use it 
as well.
&#160;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&#160;
I 
will check with Sandesh if the requirements above can be done.
I 
am available to work with him nd then come back to you, preferrably with a 
yes/no reply.
However, 
I have noted a few things that I would like to share with everybody:
&#160;
1)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It looks that the list of requirements needed for a successful mailing 
list-forum integration is getting longer and more difficult. I have asked few 
experiences programmers and put two ads so far, but got only one reply from a 
person who claims to be able to help (still, I was talking about the login 
requirement only).
2)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even if we make to successfully integrate the mailing list with the forum, there 
will likely be issues, as more complicated the integration becomes, the more 
likely we have errors
&#160;
As 
for the above points, I would like to suggest a new solution: what about replace 
entirely the mailing list with a forum?
I 
know this solution may be not recisely liked by everyone, especially the ones 
already happy with the current list, but please consider this.
Using 
a forum insead of a mailing list would have (as far as I know) a lot of 
advantages, with no disadvantage I know:
&#160;
1)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
with forum is easier to follow a lenghty discussion, you just need to look at 
the posts in sequence
2)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
it is easier to search past topics already discussed, you can have a search 
function and it is easier to look for past threads
3)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
easier to include pics and movies in the pst
4)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
easier for new people to join the forum
5)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
you can have &quot;sticky&quot; posts explaining what is Votorola and what has been done 
so far
&#160;
I 
do not know if there is any precise reason I do not know for using the mailing 
list, but if not, we could try to see if a forum is better.
&#160;
What 
I propose is:
&#160;
1)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
I can talk with the programmer, and we can move all the content of the mailing 
list in a forum
2)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
current memmbers IDs and passwords will be copied in the forum, so that people 
will be able to login in the forum with the same password
3)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
in a first phase, the forum will be in parallel with the mailing lsit, people 
will post in one and we will copy the post in the other
4)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
we will see which system works better
5)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
the forum will be places from the start in a subsite of the current 
metagovernment property site and will be 100% property of the people who own the mailing list now.6)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
the current daily digest can be sent from the forum as well.
7)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
if people will like more the forum solution, we will go ahead with the forum 
only, and put a link in the mailing list site that redirects to the forum
8)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
if people will like more the mailing list solution, we will quit the forum (I 
will talk with the programmer and see, maybe I can bear all the expenses for the 
migration myself)
&#160;
What 
do eveybody think?
&#160;
Matteo
