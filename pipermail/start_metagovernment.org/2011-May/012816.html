The links in the detailed view (d) can do that job.  Select an item in
the communities map for example, and (d) will show links to:

  * Polls the community participates in
  * People who are active members of the community
  * Topics the community discusses

Or select an item in the poll map, and you get links to:

  * Communities that are participating in that poll
  * People who are participating in that poll
  * Topics that poll is about

And so on for the other map types (people and topics).  In addition,
when the topics map is filtered to a specific set of keywords -
usually those of a community, poll or person - then it will also
provide links to:

  * Communities that discuss (some or all of) those topics
  * Polls about those topics
  * People interested in those topics

In those views, you'll see exactly how many keyords are matched by
each item.  This will indicate (very roughly) how interested each
person is in the community, or each community in the poll, and so
forth.  We might generalize this matching trick to sets of other
items, aside from topics.  So, for the active membership of a
community, which is a set of people, you would see:

  * Communities in which (some or all of) those people participate
  * Polls in which they participate
  * Topics that interest them

So links will provide navigation from map to map, as well as the
filtering (zooming) of each map.  The feed will be filtered to match.

&gt;<i> The plan sounds good, for sure.

I guess the social tasks (s) are what drive it.  We need to find
people with fire under their butts, then go to work to keep them happy
with the tools.  There's no other way forward I can see.  Rationale:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a design and plan to propose.  Very roughly:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DESIGN
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Four new maps for crossforum theatre: [1]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     i. Communities
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    ii. People
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   iii. Topics
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    iv. Polls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The structure is the same for each map.  The map consists of three
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; main visual components, from top to bottom:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    (d) Detailed view of selected item.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    (g) Graph of all items.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    (t) Table of all items.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (t) The table is the main component.  It lists each item in a paged
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; viewport (page up/down to see all).  For example, the table in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community map will normally list all known communities.  The rows may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be sorted according to any columnar value.  Clicking on the 'size'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; column in the community table, for example, will sort the rows by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number of community members (i.e. subscribers to mailing list, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever).  Clicking again reverses the order.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (g) The graph shows all items (x axis) and plots the value of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currently sorted column (y axis).  For example, you might see a bar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; graph of communities from the largest (left) to the smallest (right).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Items in the graph are highlighted by events in the feed, of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course. [2]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (d) The detailed view shows further details of the currently selected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; item.  It includes links to other maps and views.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The scoping of any map may be resticted to a single item from one of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the other maps.  For example, you may restrict the community map to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; show only the communities of a particular person, topic or poll.  And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so on for all combinations of the four maps.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By itself, this design does not meet all of the requirements [3].  But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we can meet them by adding sub-views, mini-tools and other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; details to the basic design.  For example, to support lateral
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extension (M.1-3) we might add a 'crossforum membership' column in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community table that shows how many of your collaborators are members
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of each community [4].  Vitality and vital rank (F.iii.c, d) can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projected in a heads-up display over the graph component of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community map - though only for certain views/scopes - and these can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be the views that are linked from the discussion medium (design
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem 4).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PLAN
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ----
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most of these tasks can be done in parallel:  (t) tech (s) social
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      1. (t) Add support for communities (S.1, 2) to the pollwiki.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      2. (s) Decide which topics and issues to seed.  Create the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             necessary community pages.  Plan seeding.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      3. (t) Code the forum harvesters for the key communities in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             seeding plans (2).  If we have new developers, maybe they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             could coordinate with C on this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      4. (s) Organize outfit (H).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      5. (t) Code the new maps, beginning with the community map.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      6. (s) Execute seeding plans (2).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NOTES
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -----
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   [1] <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/theatrePlan.png">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/theatrePlan.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   [2] Items in the table are highlighted too, when they are visible in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       the viewport.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   [4] This would depend on the user listing his/her crossforum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       collaborators as a registration property.  You would then see the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       degree of cross-membership only with regard to the people who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       will actually collaborate with you in lateral ventures such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       delegation, nomination or colonization (maybe voters and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       candidate by default).
