 I am sceptical here, too, and I think Mike is as well. But still it 
 makes
 sense to deploy the setup in a divisioned concept, rather than each 
 small group
 deploying its own instance. So the idea is that the local group will 
 find
 the resources to support an instance for its division if necessary. But 
 it
 doesn't make a lot of sense to run a voteserver on your own, since you 
 want
 to maximize votes from other groups in the same division. Note: 
 Divisions
 can be any partition of social reality, being it geographical or by 
 social
 means. It makes sense to be able to fork in case of conflict or 
 different
 needs, e.g. integration of the servers in your own infrastructure.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I think anyone should be able to host services for any other 
</I>&gt;<i> group or
</I>&gt;<i> community. Its not a good idea to make small groups wait until their 
</I>&gt;<i> parent
</I>&gt;<i> group... a city??? ....uses the software tools they need.
</I>&gt;<i> A small community could use the metagov tools to attract more people 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> eventually becomes a parent group for other new groups.
</I>
 It is the other way around. Small groups create the division in one of 
 the
 master servers (which has a superset of the division already running, 
 e.g.
 the top division of all: Global) and then more and more local groups 
 let
 the division and the instance become more and more official.
 The first master server already exists and so breaking it down/creating 
 a
 division is always possible (in the worst case by a necessary fork of 
 the
 division in a new local vote server+pollwiki). There is no need for the
 officials to introduce or support the infrastructure.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's the design.  The current implementation isn't something 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wants to run except a developer.  It's only a prototype and it's in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constant flux.  (Not to mention only 5 people in the universe 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand what we're working on, and most of them are here in this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Granted! That's a big problem. Maybe it might be possible to create a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;firefox plugin&quot; of the metagov tools? ..each update would be 
</I>&gt;<i> deployed
</I>&gt;<i> automatically. Or maybe its an option to use sourceforge? I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> know, I
</I>&gt;<i> guess there are many alternatives :)
</I>
 Not sure what you mean here, but our code still runs on the server 
 side.
 Crossforum can be deployed from almost anywhere technically (being it
 inside a web service like facebook or the homepage of Greenpeace), but 
 it
 still needs administrative know-how. I don't think this is easily 
 solvable
 in a &quot;P2P&quot;-way, since this would mean we can deal with all problems
 automatically. This is very unlikely since the requirements of 
 consensus
 building will be very different in each community. I think P2P is over-
 rated in the wrong way, but this is a different topic. Basically P2P
 means that you don't need a third instance when you connect parts of 
 the
 technology together (over the internet). We meet this requirement for
 independence, while not trying to move everything in one bloated client
 P2P app. Also vote-servers talk to each other directly and the code is
 open source, so they are in the best sense P2P. If you mean by P2P a 
 client
 which can be run without a server than I don't see why this is a 
 priority.
 In my impression, during the last half year, most requests to deploy or
 support the software came from admins, who know how to run servers and
 support our infrastructure. I don't think there is any problem. You can
 run a voteserver on a really low cost server in your basement, or get a
 cheap virtual server for sth. like 10&#8364;/$ a month. We will also simplify 
 the
 setup in the future once we know what the users/admins need.
 The problem is imo atm. filling crossforum and our concepts with real 
 data.
 While I do think that the bridging effort is technically the next step
 as pointed out by Mike, I'd propose to also bring some political issues
 into Metagovernment and its Crossforum to increase visibility and 
 create an
 official agenda to spread Metagoverments goals of consensus building by
 examples.
 Content is king after all... What do you think? Maybe we can arrange a 
 bit
 of (small) work, to fill Metagoverment's wiki and a central vote server
 with popular political positions and content to demonstrate its 
 capabilities?
 Then we would see first hand what we miss at least. We can limit our 
 political
 involvement to a point where we recommend to the respective groups to 
 continue
 from our setup.

 conseo

 P.S.: We can draft this process in the Wiki as well, to organize the 
 effort.
