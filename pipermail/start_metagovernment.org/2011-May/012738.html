 a fix for that.)

I was thinking along the same lines.  Also of giving each radial arm
an opaque background, like the petal of a flower.  Details like these
can make a big difference.  I think we have lots of room to play with,
in that sense.  I think it's a strong design (again mostly your ideas
in it).

&gt;<i> ... Or maybe avoid overlapping at all? ...
</I>
Probably the overlaps are essential to the design.  My guess is that
if we do them properly, they'll add to the beauty.  The user's eye can
handle a great deal of complexity (even prefers it) provided it
arrives in a natural, sensible form.

No complexity here, because of the tiny turnout:

It looks weird.  It could be a problem.  If this design figures
prominently in our user intake strategy then we'd probably need a
solution.  But it depends entirely on the intake strategy (is there a
better word for that?).  We should probably be floating ideas on that
before coding any more of this expensive UI.  (I have a suggestion of
my own to post in a day or two.)
