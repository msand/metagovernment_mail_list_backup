<PRE>No, I did not say I wasn&#8217;t interested, but it was too difficult to figure out how to vote for what.
I also have no opinion on the subject. You could count it as an abstention.
...the subject wasn&#8217;t important enough to me to invest the time to figure out how to cast my vote, because I was ok with all the proposals that were mentioned in the mailing list.

@Joe-Average
You say everyone here would agree on the goal I was talking about... (Joe Average should be able to host the tools for his community)
But Ed said something else I think. It was also said that skilled IT admins are targeted right now and there are no concrete plans and no top priority to get something done that could be used by Joe Average.
It would also invite other people to do some coding. It's not motivating to contribute to something that cannot be used, because there is no usable &quot;product&quot; yet.
Yes, all the theorycrafting and all the details must be talked through and they all should be part of the software, but what's the top priority?
Is there a list of issues of what to do in which order? Is there a plan?
Did we get the chance to vote for the priorities of that issues? Can't we use our tools for such a thing?
Wont it help us to see where improvements might help?


@Font Size
Thomas said my font size looks pretty small, is that true?

Speaking for Votorola and Crossforum: their developement isnt there yet, 
but people are working on it. I'm sure we all agree on this goal. If you 
want to help, you are very welcome! Right now I'd say testing and trying 
out what works so far is an important thing. And it is for people like 
you and me, not for joe-average yet. But you said before, you were not 
interested in the meaningless polls here. Again, just the testing of the 
tools could be enough incentive already, but I must add, I can not 
imagine something much more meaningful than defining the rules by which 
our group organizes itself.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are many of these kinds of communities and it might be possible when we target these small communities and maybe by word-of-mouth it will spread to other communities, small clubs, associations, NGO's? Every time one of them hosts or uses metagov tools, they will be connected through the &quot;metagov network&quot; which consists of all communities using metagov tools.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe in the beginning there is no connection between those small communities and they only do community-internal discussions, but as soon as multiple communities have joined which are affected by the same problems, it might happen, that these communities connect to each other.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't see the problem you are trying to address, Alex.  A group of
</I>&gt;<i> any size (two or two million) that wishes to use the tools may start
</I>&gt;<i> today.  There are no barriers in terms of installation or deployment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I never meant to suggest that the tools would be hosted or
</I>&gt;<i> administered by a city or state government (heaven forbid), but rather
</I>&gt;<i> by the citizens.  Although we have only two active citizens to date,
</I>&gt;<i> already we show many examples of this on the main page of the
</I>&gt;<i> pollwiki: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/">http://u.zelea.com/w/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any group may be formalized as a polling division if necessary.  It
</I>&gt;<i> may also be sub-divided into any number of divisions according to any
</I>&gt;<i> number of divisional schemes.  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Property:Division">http://u.zelea.com/w/Property:Division</A>
</I>&gt;<i> But nobody needs to worry about that in order to get started.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please be specific about the problem, I don't see it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is the difference between a &quot;small group&quot; and a &quot;division&quot;? Each &quot;small group&quot; could be a division, right?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The &quot;small group&quot; doesn&#8217;t need an expensive infrastructure if it's small, right?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe it might be possible to create a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;firefox plugin&quot; of the metagov tools? ..each update would be deployed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> automatically. Or maybe its an option to use sourceforge? I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> know, I guess there are many alternatives :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot; Not sure what you mean here, but our code still runs on the server  side.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hosting a Server and all software that is needed for others to participate in consensus-making efforts within a community must be simple. If the community is small, setting up a server with all the metagov tools needed should be a very transparent and simple process and this is vital!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many communities do not trust authorities, if they would, they would not be interested in direct democracy or liquid democracy or whatever. Many communities also do not know people who have IT Skills and the best person they can come up with might be someone who is able to start a browser, knows how to use google or youtube and maybe knows how to check his emails.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Running a Server for a community should be simple enough for such a person to host a server for their community, because its all about trust when it comes to digital technology which should support democratic processes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If people will need an IT Expert or need a megagov provider to register an account, that could be a barrier which might prevent people from using it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot; In my impression, during the last half year, most requests to deploy or  support the software came from admins, who know how to run servers and  support our infrastructure. I don't think there is any problem.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Guess what :) I think most communities that might profit from metagov tools did not even hear of our existence, because we cannot offer something that suits the needs of most existing communities.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot; Content is king after all... What do you think? Maybe we can arrange a  bit  of (small) work, to fill Metagoverment's wiki and a central vote server  with popular political positions and content to demonstrate its  capabilities?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, I don't think content is king. Content will only be of any interest if produced by an active community itself. In my opinion simplicity and easy usability is king, because members of a community should easily understand how the software works and what it can do for them so they build the trust that is needed to make them use the software tools.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> @Crossforum Theater
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If this is not done in p2p style, it might be easy to do some censorship by not showing certain kinds of discussion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm unsure what the current architecture looks like or what the best architecture would be, but it might not be a bad thing if communities are able to run their own crossforum theater which might be registered at other crossforum theater hosters so that they know each other and they could propagate their activities. By default, any crossforum theater server could be registered at crossforum theater server that&#8217;s run by metagovernment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This way, communities can decide if they want to use it for their private purposes or if they want to participate transparently in a global community that will slowly start to grow bigger and bigger.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A small community could use the metagov tools to attract more people

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That's the design.  The current implementation isn't something

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   automatically. This is very unlikely since the requirements of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   consensus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   building will be very different in each community. I think P2P is over-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   rated in the wrong way, but this is a different topic. Basically P2P
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   means that you don't need a third instance when you connect parts of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   technology together (over the internet). We meet this requirement for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   independence, while not trying to move everything in one bloated client
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   P2P app. Also vote-servers talk to each other directly and the code is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   open source, so they are in the best sense P2P. If you mean by P2P a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   The problem is imo atm. filling crossforum and our concepts with real

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   While I do think that the bridging effort is technically the next step

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Then we would see first hand what we miss at least. We can limit our
