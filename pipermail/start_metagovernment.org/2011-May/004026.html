Hi Mike, everybody,regarding the issue of the forum integration, I would like to point out that I have no intention to over-push this solution over the existing in any way!I believe that Votorola is an excellent project, and I would like to have more people to know about it and discuss it.My main concern is to invite as many people as I can to join the Votorola team.I believe that with a forum it should be easier than with a mailing list, this is why I am proposing this solution, but it may well be that to people will not make any difference between forum and mailing list.It is just my assumption based on the talking I had with other people.In any case, we can go with a tentative solution, if the &quot;experiment&quot; does not prove successful, we can always go back with the current solution.And, in any case, I know very well that I am one of the last members in this project, and there are other people who are in this project who have worked long time and that
 have absolutely the priority in making decisions.I would respect the decisions of Mike, Thomas and Ed whatever they are and still support Votorola as much as I can.So, please feel free to tell me if the solution proposed is not a good one.We can go back to the previous one immediately.I also offer to bear all the expenses of the programmer to do the integration.I have found an Indian programmer that is claiming to be able to do the job.I have asked to join this mailing list, so that you can tell him what to do.Financial issues will be dealt with me privately, so no need to talk here.&#160;As I saidbefore, if the new solution does not work well, please fell free to tell me and I have no problem to try to invite people to join this mailing list in the current form.&#160;Matteo
