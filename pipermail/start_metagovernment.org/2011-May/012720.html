Some prefer Web forums.  Others will be less inclined to participate
if they cannot use email to exchange messages.  Email is still the
premiere discussion medium on the net.  Each of us has his favourite
mail client that works across all forums, excepting Web forums.  The
typical Web forum UI is bolted on, take it or leave it; if you reject
the UI, then you reject the discussion.  (Thomas invented vote
mirroring to solve to the problem of split consensus.  If he tackled
the problem of split discussion, then he'd invent email. ;-)

Best of all would be software that has both mail and Web interfaces,
as we (I think with Alexander) mooted earlier.  All that comes to mind
is Google Groups (horrid) and what Steven Clift uses (peculiar stuff):

I'm short on time, otherwise I'd look around.  Although I must say, I
am happy with the status quo.

&gt;<i> One thing I don't see, however, is OpenID integration. I would really  
</I>&gt;<i> like to avoid us having multiple logins for multiple systems. Two  
</I>&gt;<i> options here would be, 1. for us to keep looking for a different BB  
</I>&gt;<i> that can integrate with OpenID (or maybe MediaWiki), or 2. for one of  
</I>&gt;<i> the programmers here to volunteer to try to hack OpenID into myBB.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would anyone want to do that? (Matteo, did you say you may have some  
</I>&gt;<i> programmers on stand-by somehow?) I haven't looked into it much, but  
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps it could be built as a module. The docs for that are here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Authoring_Plugins">http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Authoring_Plugins</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to figure this out soon so I can get started setting up  
</I>&gt;<i> whichever system we choose. I have modified the site upgrade backlog  
</I>&gt;<i> to reflect the idea of setting up the forum on the  
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment.tuxfamily.org site before we migrate the main wiki there:
