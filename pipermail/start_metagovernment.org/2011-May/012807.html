<PRE>Alexander,

The tools are for the people who use them, or help to build them.  If
you want usability improvements then either:

  1) Use

  2) Improve

If you don't do one of the above, then you aren't part of the effort
and have no right to complain with such blind persistence and force.
Please refrain from these outbursts, I beg you,

</I>&gt;<i> It would also invite other people to do some coding. It's not motivating to contribute to something that cannot be used, because there is no usable &quot;product&quot; yet.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, all the theorycrafting and all the details must be talked through and they all should be part of the software, but what's the top priority?
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a list of issues of what to do in which order? Is there a plan?
</I>&gt;<i> Did we get the chance to vote for the priorities of that issues? Can't we use our tools for such a thing?
</I>&gt;<i> Wont it help us to see where improvements might help?
