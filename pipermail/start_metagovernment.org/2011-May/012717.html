Yep, this is possible. Ideally we can show details in the mapper though.

Yep. Your input is helpful.

That is right, I have tried it already and you can still see here (as long as 
mike has not already pulled) <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/var/deploy/crossforum/#c=DG">http://u.zelea.com/var/deploy/crossforum/#c=DG</A> 
how dominant the user names will be compared to the visualized conversation. 
As you suggested and Thomas agreed, I have added a simple tooltip to the 
mnemonics in the feed for now. Yet, I'd still like to keep the further way 
open here, since the focus of the diff-feed is the difference feed discussion 
and we should visualize both usernames and pollnames there. Therefore (as also 
being discussed on IRC: 
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/system/host/u/home/v/votorola/out/voharvester/irclog/2011-05-08/Nmetagov.html">http://u.zelea.com/system/host/u/home/v/votorola/out/voharvester/irclog/2011-05-08/Nmetagov.html</A> 
) I have removed all colors, the title and stick to the mnemonics. I hope 
there will be some work for the Geomapper towards area and location specific 
poll mapping and therefore I have drafted ideas for the first prize that way: 
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?b=4326&amp;a=4328&amp;aR=2927&amp;bR=2901">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?b=4326&amp;a=4328&amp;aR=2927&amp;bR=2901</A>

conseo

P.S.: The process of drafting in two wikis, one for the position and the other 
one for the draft, is still too complicated. After the social mapper I think 
this is the biggest obstacle of getting interested enthusiasts involved.
