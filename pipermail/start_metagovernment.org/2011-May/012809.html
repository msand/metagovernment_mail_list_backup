<PRE>Hi Matteo,

You ask what we think.  I think the list is a success.  But if others
prefer a Web interface over email, then I withdraw my objections.  Do
not be concerned about backward integration on my account.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,I have received the below mail from Ed and I reply to 
</I>&gt;<i> this in public, as asked by Ed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning 
</I>&gt;<i> forum integration, there are three issues. OpenID is important, but the toughest 
</I>&gt;<i> issue is integrating the new forum with the existing list server. The third 
</I>&gt;<i> issue is choosing which forum to use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If 
</I>&gt;<i> it is logistically impractical to use a different forum, then we'll have to use 
</I>&gt;<i> phpBB. But phpBB is fairly primitive, and I would really prefer to use a more 
</I>&gt;<i> robust (but still open source) forum such as MyBB.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Supposing 
</I>&gt;<i> we use MyBB, then the main issue is figuring out how to do two-directional 
</I>&gt;<i> communication between the list (which is operated by Mailman software) and the 
</I>&gt;<i> forum. Bi-directional means:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. 
</I>&gt;<i> Any new thread in the list shows up as a new topic in one category of the 
</I>&gt;<i> forum.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. 
</I>&gt;<i> Any reply on the list shows up as a reply to the associated forum post.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. 
</I>&gt;<i> Any new topic on the forum shows up as a new thread on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. 
</I>&gt;<i> Any reply on the forum shows up as a reply (ie, with a re:) on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It 
</I>&gt;<i> is possible the M2F can help with this
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail2forum.com/v20-development/">http://mail2forum.com/v20-development/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but 
</I>&gt;<i> it is in Alpha. Still it might be a good codebase to start with. They do a good 
</I>&gt;<i> description of how it should work as well:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mail2forum.com/v20-development/m2f-20-design/m2f-20-threading-uses-cases/">http://mail2forum.com/v20-development/m2f-20-design/m2f-20-threading-uses-cases/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then 
</I>&gt;<i> there is the issue of OpenID integration. That is relatively straight-forward. I 
</I>&gt;<i> would prefer to only allow people to subscribe to the list with an OpenID login. 
</I>&gt;<i> The forum doesn't have to be an OpenID server, it can just be a client, where 
</I>&gt;<i> people set up an OpenID somewhere else. If we use MyBB, there is an OpenID 
</I>&gt;<i> module already built:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mods.mybb.com/reviews/openid">http://mods.mybb.com/reviews/openid</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but 
</I>&gt;<i> I have not checked to see if it is really functional.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As 
</I>&gt;<i> you can see, this is a tricky set of requirements, and they are all in flux. I 
</I>&gt;<i> posted a question to the Mailman list to see if the people there have experience 
</I>&gt;<i> with this sort of thing to give us some advice, but I have not heard back 
</I>&gt;<i> yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If 
</I>&gt;<i> we do end up having&#160;Sandesh&#160;or 
</I>&gt;<i> someone program this, it would also be nice if they would be willing to 
</I>&gt;<i> contribute their code back to the relevant projects so that others could use it 
</I>&gt;<i> as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> I 
</I>&gt;<i> will check with Sandesh if the requirements above can be done.
</I>&gt;<i> I 
</I>&gt;<i> am available to work with him nd then come back to you, preferrably with a 
</I>&gt;<i> yes/no reply.
</I>&gt;<i> However, 
</I>&gt;<i> I have noted a few things that I would like to share with everybody:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 1)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> It looks that the list of requirements needed for a successful mailing 
</I>&gt;<i> list-forum integration is getting longer and more difficult. I have asked few 
</I>&gt;<i> experiences programmers and put two ads so far, but got only one reply from a 
</I>&gt;<i> person who claims to be able to help (still, I was talking about the login 
</I>&gt;<i> requirement only).
</I>&gt;<i> 2)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> Even if we make to successfully integrate the mailing list with the forum, there 
</I>&gt;<i> will likely be issues, as more complicated the integration becomes, the more 
</I>&gt;<i> likely we have errors
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> As 
</I>&gt;<i> for the above points, I would like to suggest a new solution: what about replace 
</I>&gt;<i> entirely the mailing list with a forum?
</I>&gt;<i> I 
</I>&gt;<i> know this solution may be not recisely liked by everyone, especially the ones 
</I>&gt;<i> already happy with the current list, but please consider this.
</I>&gt;<i> Using 
</I>&gt;<i> a forum insead of a mailing list would have (as far as I know) a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> advantages, with no disadvantage I know:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 1)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> with forum is easier to follow a lenghty discussion, you just need to look at 
</I>&gt;<i> the posts in sequence
</I>&gt;<i> 2)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> it is easier to search past topics already discussed, you can have a search 
</I>&gt;<i> function and it is easier to look for past threads
</I>&gt;<i> 3)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> easier to include pics and movies in the pst
</I>&gt;<i> 4)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> easier for new people to join the forum
</I>&gt;<i> 5)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> you can have &quot;sticky&quot; posts explaining what is Votorola and what has been done 
</I>&gt;<i> so far
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> I 
</I>&gt;<i> do not know if there is any precise reason I do not know for using the mailing 
</I>&gt;<i> list, but if not, we could try to see if a forum is better.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> What 
</I>&gt;<i> I propose is:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 1)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> I can talk with the programmer, and we can move all the content of the mailing 
</I>&gt;<i> list in a forum
</I>&gt;<i> 2)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> current memmbers IDs and passwords will be copied in the forum, so that people 
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to login in the forum with the same password
</I>&gt;<i> 3)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> in a first phase, the forum will be in parallel with the mailing lsit, people 
</I>&gt;<i> will post in one and we will copy the post in the other
</I>&gt;<i> 4)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> we will see which system works better
</I>&gt;<i> 5)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> the forum will be places from the start in a subsite of the current 
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment property site and will be 100% property of the people who own the mailing list now.6)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> the current daily digest can be sent from the forum as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 7)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> if people will like more the forum solution, we will go ahead with the forum 
</I>&gt;<i> only, and put a link in the mailing list site that redirects to the forum
</I>&gt;<i> 8)&#160;&#160;&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> if people will like more the mailing list solution, we will quit the forum (I 
</I>&gt;<i> will talk with the programmer and see, maybe I can bear all the expenses for the 
</I>&gt;<i> migration myself)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> What 
</I>&gt;<i> do eveybody think?
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> Matteo
