<PRE>More ideas on how to visualize community space (F): [1]

The visuals/tools for community space are best tailored to the most
urgent problems facing the user within that space.  The most urgent
problems are related to the lateral extension or vitality of the
effort or poll (F.iii.c).  Loss of vitality will threaten the death of
the poll and the attendant loss of invested effort - all that work
drafting international whaling regulations, or whatever the issue is.
The user therefore has a motive to maintain or increase the vitality
of the poll by whatever means are available.

MEANS OF LATERAL EXTENSION
--------------------------
  M.1. Leaf growth by crossforum delegation.

       Ma and Mn to collaborate.  Ma is a leaf voter in strongly
       active community Ca and a plain member in inactive community
       Cn.  Mn is a second member of Cn.  The method is:

           1. Mn votes for Ma.

              Ma is now a delegate with a single voter.

           2. Mn and Ma begin discussing their differences in Cn.

       Cn is now established as an active community and poll vitality
       is thereby increased.

  M.2. Root growth by crossforum nomination.

       Ma and Mn to collaborate.  Ma is a leaf voter or (better) root
       candidate in strongly active community Ca and a plain member in
       inactive community Cn.  Mn is a second member of Cn, and Mo is
       a third.  The method is:

            1. Ma and Mn uncast if they are voters, and pin each
               others drafts together. [2]

            2. Ma and Mn begin discussing their differences in Cn.
               They continue discussing until it happens they arrive
               at a dispute.

            3. Ma and Mn both vote for Mo and invite Mo to help
               arbitrate their dispute.

               Mo is now a root candidate with two immediate voters
               and two or more votes (more is better).

       Again, Cn is now active and vitality is increased.

  M.3. Crossforum colonization. (Thomas's idea)

       Ma and Mv to collaborate.  Ma and Mv are members of strongly
       active community Ca and plain members of inactive community Cn.
       Mv is voting for Ma.  Mv may have co-voters (the more the
       better).  The method is simple:

            1. Ma, Mv and co-voters begin discussing their differences
               in Cn.

       Again, Cn is now active and vitality is increased.


STRUCTURAL SUPPORTS
-------------------
  S.1. Community pages in pollwiki.

       Each community is formalized by a page in the pollwiki.  Among
       other information and data, the page encodes:

          a) Topics of community.  This is implemented as a folksonomy
             by way of semantic properties [3]. Polls are also
             categorized by the same folksonomy.

             This enables us to construct the community space for
             every poll, and the pollspace for every community.

          b) Chronology.  A dated list of events, including dates of
             community activation (or re-activation) and the usernames
             of the activators.

  S.2. Community membership in user pages.

       Registration properties in each user page are extended to
       include a list of communities in which the user is a member,
       together with other membership data, such as community-specific
       usernames.

       This will enables us (somehow) to structure community space in
       the theatre app according to crossforum membership relations.
       The strongest crossforum tie-lines among the active and
       inactive communities (or better yet clusters of the latter) are
       the most promising and likely avenues for poll extension.
