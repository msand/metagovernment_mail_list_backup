<PRE>
Hi all,
I did not participate in the recent discussions here, I apologize for 
that.
I would like to update everyone about my activities related to Votorola so 
far:
&#160;
1)&#160;&#160;&#160; As for the forum point, I have found an Indian programmer who may be 
helpful for the integration.
I have discussed the issue in private with Thomas and Ed and offered to 
bear the expenses for this part of work.
Now it looks like this work may not be needed, so I will wait until Ed and 
the people involved will make a decision which forum platform to use.
After that decision is been taken, if necessary we can still contact the 
Indian programmer for help
As for the benefits of having a forum, I beg to ntice that, in addition to 
the Prtuguese team (Armando and Carlos who have posted here), there are other 
Italian programmers that are willing to participate in discussion.
Having a public forum may help.

&#160;
2)&#160;&#160;&#160; As for the prize issue, I would like to contribute with 75USD (first 
payment) and then later on with other payments down the road according to what 
is needed . The Indian programmer about and another one may be interested in 
taking part in the prize competition, I hope the rules will be defined soon so 
that they will be able to join.
&#160;
3)&#160;&#160;&#160; Today I am calling Mr. Giulietti who is working on the application 
Agora 2.0.
I&#160;will invite him to join the discussion here.
