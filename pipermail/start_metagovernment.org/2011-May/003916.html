<PRE>Hello everyone, my name is Hayen Mill and I'd like to introduce my project.

The project, called Cyber Democracy, is a concept currently under
development which seeks to combine direct democracy with mainstream
portable information technology such as smartphones and tablets, in an
effort to improve the efficiency and feedback of current
organizations, businesses and, ultimately, our representative
democratic societies.

It started in January 2010 on a Webforum thread and has since been
developing. We are looking forward developing the software and
implementing it locally in our birth country: Portugal. We have set
the goal of developing a beta version of the software around the year
2015, though we are confident that we will be able to greatly reduce
this time.

Below follows the link to our project's current website/blog:

Thank you for your time, and good work in your projects! All of them
look very promising!

</PRE>
