<PRE>How about this (assuming it can be done)?

Have all messages and replies on the forum post to this list. And all  
posts on the list post to the forum.  I think this is possible in some  
fora. However it may result in a lot of increased traffic on the list.  
Therefore:

Set up a second list server (it may be possible to set it up as a  
subset of the first) which only receives announcements of new topics  
started on the forum.

That would allow people to choose their mode of participation. The  
hard part is finding a solution that can handle all of the above (and  
preferably let people log into the forum with OpenID). I'll try to  
research it but can't atm: posting from my phone now. Anyone else  
already know of a solution?
