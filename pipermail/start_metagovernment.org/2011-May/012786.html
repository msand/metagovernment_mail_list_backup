<PRE>Welcome Wybo,

Thank you for replying, please see my answers below.

&gt;<i> Why focus on voting:
</I>&gt;<i> - Apart from practical reasons of keeping the paper focussed, it also

</I>&gt;<i>   be kept separate.
</I>&gt;<i> - Advantage of implementing it as a separate / interoperable app /

</I>&gt;<i>   It is a core, smallest common denominator.
</I>
Your exclusive focus on voting seems to be the only justification for
the importance you attach to critical mass (below).  It threatens to
undermine the overall argument of your essay.

&gt;<i> Why focus on critical mass:
</I>&gt;<i> - Because it is the biggest problem facing online communities, and one
</I>&gt;<i>   that is often ignored (no, if you build it, they will not come!).
</I>&gt;<i>   And without it, nothing but marginalization will ensue.
</I>
Mass cannot be the only possible answer.  Thomas (offlist) mentions
drafting media in this context, to which I would add Wikipedia as an
example.  Wikipedia had a low mass initially, but it was not thereby
marginalized.  It grew continually and did not stall. *

I suspect that cultural and other aggregative forms of expression can
be immune to network effects, and I would place legislative expression
- even if it were stamped ADVISORY ONLY - well within that category.

&gt;<i> Why only advisory:
</I>&gt;<i> - Because it will provide the best interaction with existing
</I>&gt;<i>   institutions, and will be seen as reasonable by the majority. What
</I>&gt;<i>   happens after traction has been gained among millions of people 
</I>&gt;<i>   and advice is grossly ignored, is up to history. Though personally I
</I>&gt;<i>   am not in favour of doing away with any existing democratic
</I>&gt;<i>   institutions.
</I>
Some mistake?  I did not recommend &quot;doing away&quot; with any institutions,
or speak of them flaunting the public will.  I think all of the state
institutions are strong enough to endure the formation of an
independent public will - having done so in the past - and I believe
that a resurgent public would only strengthen them further. **

If we could somehow limit the public's influence on government to an
advisory role, then how would that result in the &quot;best interaction&quot;?
I gave reasons why it *cannot* be so limited, but why do you say it
*ought* to be?

&gt;<i> Why global:
</I>&gt;<i> - Facebook, the internet, and the most pressing issues are global. In
</I>&gt;<i>   addition the democratic deficit is greatest at this level. Also,
</I>&gt;<i>   most people will have at least some interest in global issues.
</I>

 ** We must make an exception for the party system.  As an institution
    of will formation and expression it is unlikely to benefit from a
    functional public sphere.  Historically the rise of mass parties
    was attended by a decline in the public sphere, and there is every
    reason to suppose the two are incompatible.  They seem to occupy
    the same &quot;niche&quot; in the social ecosystem.
