<PRE>I have been doing some research on bulletin boards to see what would  
fit our needs best, and at the moment I am leaning toward myBB, in  
part because it is well liked for its administrative capabilities  
(something which phpBB is really bad at).

One native feature of myBB is that users can subscribe to entire  
categories of the forum and be notified when there is a new topic  
posted to the forum. Thus we could set up this list server as a user  
on the forum and have it subscribe to one or more categories. That  
would mean that every time someone starts a new topic in such  
categories, this list would be notified of it. The discussion would  
then occur on the BB... this list would just be more of a notification  
list. Does that sound good to people?

One thing I don't see, however, is OpenID integration. I would really  
like to avoid us having multiple logins for multiple systems. Two  
options here would be, 1. for us to keep looking for a different BB  
that can integrate with OpenID (or maybe MediaWiki), or 2. for one of  
the programmers here to volunteer to try to hack OpenID into myBB.

Would anyone want to do that? (Matteo, did you say you may have some  
programmers on stand-by somehow?) I haven't looked into it much, but  
perhaps it could be built as a module. The docs for that are here:
<A HREF="http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Authoring_Plugins">http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Authoring_Plugins</A>

I'd like to figure this out soon so I can get started setting up  
whichever system we choose. I have modified the site upgrade backlog  
to reflect the idea of setting up the forum on the  
metagovernment.tuxfamily.org site before we migrate the main wiki there:
