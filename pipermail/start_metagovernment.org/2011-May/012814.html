</I>&gt;<i> claiming to be able to do the job.I have asked to join this mailing list,
</I>&gt;<i> so that you can tell him what to do.Financial issues will be dealt with me
</I>&gt;<i> privately, so no need to talk here. As I saidbefore, if the new solution
</I>&gt;<i> does not work well, please fell free to tell me and I have no problem to
</I>&gt;<i> try to invite people to join this mailing list in the current form. Matteo

In fact I have talked to Mike about phpBB and similiar forums software 
integration in the first place. The voharvester, which is crawling for relevant 
discussion data, is designed to allow different kind of discussion media and 
phpBB will very likely be one of them in the future anyway. I am really sad 
that I have so little time atm. otherwise I would join this effort now and have 
a look at how to best integrate it with a phpBB forum. Multidimensional 
analysis really twists my imagination and sucks my spare time...
But if you send all new forum posts to the list anyway, then it will work for 
now. It just won't link to the forum post directly, but to the respective post 
on the list (which should link to the forum post then). But I guess it is not 
too much work to get phpBB correctly integrated, so maybe I can do it rather 
sooner than later... It definetly fits the design of Votorola.
