<PRE>Hi Roger,

Welcome to the list.  When you speak of actions that a group may take,
do you mean actions based on agreement?  Does InterMix have facilities
for this purpose, such as voting?

&gt;<i> Hello to Metagov,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I was going to keep out of this until the InterMix project I am
</I>&gt;<i> working on is truly open source - i.e. on the web, downloadable, licensed
</I>&gt;<i> carefully and has a usable version available for testing.  But a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> points have come up - one the need for a forum that can double as an email
</I>&gt;<i> list - and two the desire to bring in multiple communities - that InterMix
</I>&gt;<i> can handle.  That plus InterMix has built in ratings with the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> sort by value and controversy as well as by date.  So it is in line with the
</I>&gt;<i> idea of community voting.  And I believe it will be user-friendly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be sure, InterMix is not and does not pretend to be a method of
</I>&gt;<i> governing, but what it can do is to get people on the same page as to
</I>&gt;<i> general approach, and it has some nice bells and whistles.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One major innovation is that when multiple groups use it together, the
</I>&gt;<i> groups can link up with autonomous and reversible actions that can be taken
</I>&gt;<i> by each group on its own.  The flow of messages and ratings determine a
</I>&gt;<i> bottom up hierarchy in a system where each community maintains its freedom
</I>&gt;<i> of action.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See more at <A HREF="http://intermix.org,">http://intermix.org,</A> intermix.org/uri.htm and
</I>&gt;<i> intermix.org/panda.htm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Happy to answer questions.  Main one I suspect is when will InterMix be
</I>&gt;<i> available.  Alas, the launch date keeps receding.  Still, a lot of work has
</I>&gt;<i> been done and there is an early alpha now up and running.  Should usable for
</I>&gt;<i> metagov by fall, 2011.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> atb,
