Yes, outward looking.  Online groups aren't normally hosted on the
same servers, but rather scattered all over the Internet.  So we look
outward.  (In theory too, freedom and consensus require that people
orient themselves outward as well as inward, to include all others.)

&gt;<i> The point of the cross-forum project is that it lets existing communities

</I>
Yes, a bridge among community networks that are otherwise separate.
It is also a bridge among disparate media such as discussion, drafting
and voting - though that's looking to be a secondary function.

&gt;<i> ... Does Intermix take this same meta-approach? And if so, might

GWT/Java for crossforum theatre.  We should be able to cover InterMix
in the same way we cover other discussion media, using standard
Internet protocols and whatever APIs are exposed.

&gt;<i> Eventually InterMix will need an application interface, but that is
</I>&gt;<i> down the road.
</I>
We don't absolutely need APIs.  (Correct me if I'm wrong C.)
