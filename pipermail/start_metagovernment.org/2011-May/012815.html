That should work.  I assume thread and post URLs won't depend on the
category, so the move won't break any links.

Myself, I can't be of much help unless I'm actually participating in
the practice of governance or consensus making.  I'm a tool developer
and tools are always developed in support of a particular practice -
the development and the practice going hand in hand.  Unfortunately,
both are currently stalled here in Metagov for lack of 2 participants
(Thomas and I being unable to carry the burden alone).  If a new Web
forum were to bring 2 participants, then I could resume development
within that context.

That seems doubtful to me.  If we don't join in the effort ourselves,
then how can we ask others to?  Any participants we managed to attract
would have to come from somewhere and bring with them something we
ourselves lack.  The attraction is actually in the opposite direction.
Our own efforts are stalled and, rather than trying to attract others,
it behooves us to look at what *they* are doing and to consider
joining *them* and fitting the tools to *their* practices.  That's how
I figure it, anyway.

Still, we can work in parallel.  So I withdraw my objections.
