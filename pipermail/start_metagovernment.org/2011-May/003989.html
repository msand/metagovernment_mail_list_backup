<PRE>I have checked with Eranga about whether he is able to help us with the 
forum integration, but it looks like the work is not as easy as I 
thought..
Here is Eranga reply to my request of help.
&#160;

Dear Matteo,
I had a look at the requirements and I found some 
research and learning has to be done since i haven't done something similar. 
Since I'm busy&#160;with my new Job's office work I think i will not be able to put 
the commitment required. There for I'm Sorry to inform you that i will not be 
able to participate in this project.
It was nice to get to know you 
and if you have any other projects like

PHP, J Query,&#160;Java Script, and HTML /
C# Windows Applications
Data Bass Designing and implementation with Oracle, 
MS SQL, MY SQL (Stored Procedure)
System Designing
Where I don&#8217;t have to put any additional effort , I 
would Love to Participate and Work,
Hope You will be able to get the Job Don.
Thank You.
&#160;

I still think it may be useful to have Eranga to 
work for us (he is an experienced Java programmer I have been told) and I offer 
to pay him if someone is interested to employ him to do some work.
I need to hear from Mike and Thomas whether there is 
a need for this.
In addition to this, as for the main forum 
integration job, I will now post few ads for the forum integration work, hoping 
that someone will reply and help us.
Other solution, would be to go with PhPbb
&#160;
Regards,
Matteo
