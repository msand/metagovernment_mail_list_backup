</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagov content then would be stored as subpages of the area page.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Assuming area name 'M', the pages would be named M/this and M/that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; See for example how Toronto's pages are named:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:PrefixIndex/Tor">http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:PrefixIndex/Tor</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only pages sitting at top level in a multi-area wiki are the area
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pages themselves: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Category:Area">http://u.zelea.com/w/Category:Area</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But there also needs to be &quot;meta&quot;content which is outside the scope of  
</I>&gt;<i> the issue-related content: something that helps orient people to the  
</I>&gt;<i> site when they first visit it. Could you flip the idea, and have all  
</I>&gt;<i> of the area pages inside a directory and all related content in sub- 
</I>&gt;<i> directories of that?
</I>
Unfortunately no.  A multi-area pollwiki is a logical stand-in for
multiple wikis.  If we allowed meta-content, then it would seem to
take priority over area content.  If an area admin disagreed with the
meta-content, then he'd be tempted to decamp and set up a pollwiki of
his own.  We can't support that yet and don't want to spend time on it
till it's crucial, so we came up with the idea of a strictly neutral,
multi-area pollwiki, just as a stopgap.  More here:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht</A>

&gt;<i> Neither that nor your solution sounds very elegant. Are you  
</I>&gt;<i> envisioning merging the two wikis? Couldn't they exist side-by-side?
</I>
Definitely.  A pollwiki is a user-editable database of polling data
and related content.  It may contain non-polling content too, but only
if that makes sense and is convenient.  The best arrangement for
Metagov is probably:

  a) Ordinary content in ordinary wiki.

  b) Polling related data/content in an area of the common pollwiki.

Later Metagov can go independent if necessary by upgrading the
ordinary wiki into a pollwiki proper (semantic extensions etc.) and
migrating the polling data/content across.  You'd have to deploy your
own cluster of vote-servers too, so this is no small operation.  See:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#mul">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#mul</A>

&gt;<i> &gt; BTW - Ed, I noticed that you're fighting vandalism in the wiki again.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure, but one thing to try (temporarily as needed) might be:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  $wgEmailConfirmToEdit = true;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgEmailConfirmToEdit">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgEmailConfirmToEdit</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm somewhat reluctant to further raise the barriers to participation.  
</I>&gt;<i> As it is, contributors must register and pass a captcha. The people  
</I>&gt;<i> who are still passing those barriers might not be hindered by an e- 
</I>&gt;<i> mail requirement. I'm open to ideas...
</I>
The pollwiki requires new registrants to enter their email addresses
and we never really get attacked.  Maybe that's just because we're off
the beaten path, but it definitely complicates things for an attacker
if he needs a bona-fide email address.  Still I agree, I'd only raise
the barriers temporarily in response to attacks, and only as high as
needed.

Another possible method is to temporarily block edits from users who
aren't &quot;autoconfirmed&quot;.  Ordinary users will already be autoconfirmed.
This probably only works if the attackers strike soon after
registering, because I think autoconfirmation is based on a timer.
And it's a little trickier to set up.
