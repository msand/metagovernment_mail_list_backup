The technical possibility of such a community-map is clear to me. I'm 
just beginning to see the use of it. What is such a community defined 
by? The discussion-medium they use, right? An email-list, forum, 
whatever ... I pictured it always of no importance where the discussion 
takes place. If I had 15 voters to deal with, I would go anywhere to 
talk to them. I wouldnt care where. Same with my candidate: I would just 
go, where he is, no matter where. And maybe thats how it is going to be 
at some point in the future. But I'm beginning to understand, that this 
is not how it will probably start. People will start from within their 
community and then it is a boost for them to see whats happening in 
other active communities ... As well it is a boost for members of an 
inactive community to see, that they appear to have nothing to say to 
this subject ;-)

Am I getting the picture?

Thomas
