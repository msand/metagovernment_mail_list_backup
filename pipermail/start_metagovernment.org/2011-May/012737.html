It's not unlikely.  Again it'll depend on who we expect as users and
how we intend them to be involved.

This assumes that everyone will be drafting in one wiki, but our users
might have a wiki (or wikis) of their own.  In that case, we'd be back
to free ranging across multiple wikis.

We might still move the pollwiki to metagov's servers/domain.  That
possibility was floated earlier (couple months ago?).  We'd need to be
sure about the reasons for the move, because it would add workload in
places where we're already overloaded.  Also we'd have to consider
that it's a multi-area pollwiki, which means that Metagov content
would probably have to be stored under a dedicated area
(e.g. M/content) and not as top-level pages, as now.
