Unfortunately we can't estimate our beta readiness till after we pass
alpha tests.  It feels like we're close (I agree with Thomas), but we
can't be sure.  Tests start in a few weeks and run for 3 months
minimum.  Till then, we're still in an experimental stage.

&gt;<i> III -  a tool to help &quot;educated&quot; citizens, to show them the implications

As far as I know, there's no toolset that can do I and II at large
scales.  You couldn't have a whole city (say) engaged in an issue of
real interest.  There's nothing's strong enough for that.  I've heard
of tools/processes that can engage small, representative &quot;citizens
groups&quot; in advisory roles, but I don't know the details.  Maybe others
in the list know?
