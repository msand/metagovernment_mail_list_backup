<PRE>&quot;So I do agree with Alexander on this.
But nevertheless I also agree with Mike and Conseo, that it would give a
boost to the whole thing, if several communities were involved in a
consensus-finding-effort and if they would know of each other. I mean, the
whole crossforum-design was inspired by this idea, wasnt it?&quot;

 

Sure, it would be a boost if other communities were involved. If anyone
knows of a community try to get them involved. But it won't help if we just
&quot;wish&quot; for it.

I guess many people stumble upon metagov when they search for
consensus-making-tools, but will probably leave the website, because there
is no download button and one-click-installer that will get them started
instantly.
An alternative would be an intuitive demo of the software and the
possibility to create an account for a community which people could join. It
would also be nice to be able to join by using an already existing facebook
or google account.

 

All I tried to suggest was to start using our tools for everything we do, so
that we have at least ourselves as a community to evaluate the tools by
using them.

 

Isn't feedback for metagov tools about how to improve them a
consensus-finding-effort of how the tools should evolve? So instead of using
something like this:
(  &lt;<A HREF="http://uservoice.com/">http://uservoice.com/</A>&gt; <A HREF="http://uservoice.com/">http://uservoice.com/</A> )

.we could try to use our tools.
In the end, what we do is consensus-finding-effort which might or must
transition into action (e.g. theory crafting or programming or marketing? .)
and that's what our tools should handle well (consensus-making =&gt; into
action) :-)

Here has been talk of wether or not our tools can, should or would be used
inside metagov. 

The matter of fact is: they have been used already and even sucsessfully
used! Look at the Metaquestion for Metagovernment thread!

So I do agree with Alexander on this.
But nevertheless I also agree with Mike and Conseo, that it would give a
boost to the whole thing, if several communities were involved in a
consensus-finding-effort and if they would know of each other. I mean, the
whole crossforum-design was inspired by this idea, wasnt it? 

So I agree with you plan (and its details), Mike, but would also work on the
metagov-hompepage for instance.

So this is like crossforum theatre with the old diff feed and a
new community-space map. (How come C's diff feed always gets
reused, but I have to code new maps? Help. :-)


I didnt picture a seperate community-space map, just a headline over each
speech-bubble from which forum/community it comes. But I admit a seperate
map for that sounds compelling.




H. The seeding of the inter-community network is coordinated by an
outfit that is dedicated to that purpose. They are the ones who
ensure, for example, that requirement G is met.


I feel that Metagov would be the natural home of this outfit.
