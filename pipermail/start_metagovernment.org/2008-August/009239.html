<PRE>This list has slowed recently as some content has moved to the wiki  
and as the programmers have been working on code. Well, as far as I  
know, Manuel and Aur have each been working on separate branches, and  
others have not had much opportunity to help them.

I would like to remind the other programmers on the list that you can  
help right now by contributing to the great starts made by both Manuel  
and Aur. If you're not sure how, just reply to this message and I'm  
sure they'll help clarify.

Currently this list has 24 members and the wiki has 30 registered  
users. The wiki went live on June 20 (59 days ago), and the homepage's  
hit count is now well over 4,000 (most pages on the wiki have a hit  
count at the bottom of the page). Overall, the metagovernment.org  
website gets an average of about 1,000 visitors a month, varying  
significantly depending on where we get mentioned: this month, we've  
already had over 1,100 visitors. For some reason, links to us from  
Stumbleupon seem to be a large driver of traffic (over 200 so far in  
August). Apart from the humans, Yahoo and Google bots seem to be  
crawling through the wiki at all times.

We've had several new folks join recently, and I would like to  
encourage them to post an introduction message to this list and/or to  
create a user page on the wiki.

If you are not a programmer and are not sure how to further  
contribute, please help out the wiki. If you aren't sure how to  
contribute to the wiki, have a look at the archives of this list and  
make new wiki pages based on the ideas we came up with there. Or post  
your current ideas to the list, and see what we come up with. This is  
a very creative group of people... when we're active.

I apologize that I have been caught up in other projects for a while  
now and have not been moving the group along, but after all, until we  
have a working model of Metascore, we are still an adhocracy, so  
everyone is free to push ahead as you see fit. :)
