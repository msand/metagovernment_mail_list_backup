I like what these other projects are doing, but I do have some  
concerns about their implementation strategy. Although they are ahead  
of us on having websites which can discuss/generate laws, they seem to  
be focused on high-level national politics of the United States. While  
this is a worthy area of concern, it has several consequences which  
can decrease their chance of success...

First, by concentrating on the U.S. they ignore the rest of the world;  
I don't see why a global internet has to perpetuate national  
divisions. Are they going to require that people show American  
citizenship in order to participate? Or are they going to let the  
whole world decide American policy? Neither seems workable.

Second, national politics are complex and difficult. While plenty of  
people have plenty of opinions about national politics, most Americans  
do not want to dig through the details of a 5-page piece of highly  
legalistic legislation concerning unemployment compensation.

Third, they seem to use simplistic forms of voting (majority rule?).

Fourth, they don't seem to have ambitions to actually become the  
government. In this respect, they seem like a nice intermediate  
between the status quo and the Metagovernment, but not a real long- 
term solution.

I think that our approach of intending to be the government of *any*  
community is a winning strategy. To succeed, we don't have to  
transform the politics of one of the most powerful nations in the  
world... we just have to enable a chess club to operate without a  
president. From there, the rest can fall into place rather simply.

I very much want to work with these organizations in whatever ways we  
can. But I do have trouble seeing how we can reconcile those  
differences above. I don't know enough programming to be able to  
evaluate their code, but I do think they can learn from us about how  
to do something better than mere voting. (As I'm writing this, I see  
Pietro just said much the same thing.)

In any event, there is certainly no malice between us, and I think we  
would all like to see *something* succeed, regardless of what project  
it is. It may be that the best we can do for now is to help promote  
each other (at least by cross-linking, if not more). We can see how  
the cards fall from there.


P.S. OK, so my net access is limited, but sometimes I do find a window  
for working, even while traveling heavily.
