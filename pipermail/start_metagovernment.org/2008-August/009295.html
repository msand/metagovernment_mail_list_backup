<PRE>Hi RIchard,
thanks for your answer.

Yes I know Clay and his work.
When I wrote my entry on my blog
<A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/05/25/tag-clouds-metric/">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/05/25/tag-clouds-metric/</A>
on how to use tags to find a distance between resources he was on the
delicious mailing list, and wrote some wonderful reviews. Months later
I contacted him for a talk I was giving and he still remembered and
liked it.

I understand what you say about flexible categorization, and I agree
that it might be a bit better, but this requires to have things easily
recategorized. And supposes a single point of view.
You see some people think Bush is a war criminal, some that he is a
hero. So where should we put him.
Of course the classification might change with time, but my aunt and
my brother will just never agree on that.

But maybe you could help us to write a tag interface that permit to
people to change their personal tagcloud for a resource in an easy,
fun and intuitive way. The more fun it is, the more people will keep
their data precise.

I wish I was able to admit when I was wrong this easily. Nice to have
you on board.

&gt;<i> Clay
</I>&gt;<i> Shirky, whom I have a great deal of respect for, wrote a very
</I>&gt;<i> compelling argument against ontologies and categorisation which is
</I>&gt;<i> very much worth the long read:

</I>
Yes, I know this by heart, there is also an online audio version
somwhere around.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But - and here is where I'm going out on a limb - this is where I
</I>&gt;<i> think Bertrand Russell, Shirky and you miss a potential trick.
</I>
Bertrand Russell? Fuck, I should really read all those books my
grandfather left me!

&gt;<i> Absolutely, static categorisation will always fail -- but
</I>&gt;<i> categorisation only needs to be static in a pre-computerised era.
</I>&gt;<i> Logical atomism, I believe, makes the mistake of trying to be 100%
</I>&gt;<i> accurate in its categorisations, which is like looking for God in a
</I>&gt;<i> microscope - it doesn't really make sense when you step back and think
</I>&gt;<i> about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But the logical base of it, the aristothelean world view that things either are or are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not is a bit naive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed - but I don't subscribe to the all-or-nothing proposal that it
</I>&gt;<i> has to be all-or-nothing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a system that is only 51% accurate, but able to
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically modify itself, then you'll still never get to 100%
</I>&gt;<i> accuracy, but you might grow it to 99%, although likely lower. This
</I>&gt;<i> means that even if you cannot quantify its accuracy percentage against
</I>&gt;<i> a 'universal truthometer', you can know that you're on the path
</I>&gt;<i> towards getting there - which is something we don't have now. This is
</I>&gt;<i> the point at which I'd use Clay Shirky to argue against himself:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/03/09/one_world_two_maps_thoughts_on_the_wikipedia_debate.php">http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/03/09/one_world_two_maps_thoughts_on_the_wikipedia_debate.php</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  to argue that incremental changes can have significant value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway - none of this should have any bearing on how Metagovernment or
</I>&gt;<i> Metascore develops, not least because I am aware that I could be
</I>&gt;<i> spectacularly wrong, but also because I deeply believe in the power of
</I>&gt;<i> emergence to find the most useful strategy in this environment - that
</I>&gt;<i> we differ in some technophilosophical premises is a good thing!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tagging folksonomies automatically tend to get you somewhere above 50%
</I>&gt;<i> accuracy, leveraging from external forms of consensus generation -
</I>&gt;<i> it's a good choice for Metagovernment because it's low-risk and thus
</I>&gt;<i> more likely to actually work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Cheers,
Pietro
