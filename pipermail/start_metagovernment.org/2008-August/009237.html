</I>&gt;<i> As long as we can get a few of those Representatives in place by 2010 -- at
</I>&gt;<i> least here in the United States, according to Free Government's plan of
</I>&gt;<i> action -- we'll have the perfect platform on which to launch MetaGovernment!

Christopher,
I would say, don't hold your breath on that.

We might not get anyone in for a looong time. But this would not matter. I
fully agree with Ed. We just need to get something out that permit some
community, somwhere to run easily, smoothly, with no hierarchical structure.
Doing this is already a major transition. Showing that this is possible
would already be great. It might be that to show something is possible you
need to have is running in  aplace for 10 years, or more. And after that it
might get accepted in other places. Those things follow some very non linear
dinamic with the usual punctuated evolution dynamic, where you wait and wait
and wait, slowly getting things better, and the it all fall in place like
The Wall in 1989.

Look at Clinton talk on ted.com about building a health system in rwanda. He
is just trying to show that it is possible to have a good health system even
with very limited resources. Once you have shown that something is possible,
others WILL copy it. Maybe not in the order you would desire it, but it will
get copied. This is the nature of darwinian evolution at the society level.
Bet society system get abandoned, and better one get copied. But still the
nation you really like might be just the last one who uses the system you
desired, way after your death. Somehow we need to move our focus from being
a steward of one country to doing it for the benefit of H. (can't use too
many big words in one post, you'll have to do with just the initials)

What does concern me is, is that you and other might start to put some
expectations and requests on some dates, so that if those do not succeed you
get discouraged, and quit. Let's just get someone somwhere to use it.
Someone who is not online preferebly. SO that we can see the decisions being
implemented in real life.
