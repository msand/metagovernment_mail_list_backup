</I>
I touched upon this briefly with the Obama/Palin post - if you have an
ontology which would allow you to categorise the values that lead you
to believing that Bush is in either category, then those same values
would tend to have follow-through consequences on other leaders too
which one might not think that they agree with - forcing to individual
to re-evaluate their contradictory opinions or to fix the 'broken'
categories in the system. Either way is a plus.

Even if you and your aunt disagree on some big stuff, and according to
your view of the world, she holds some massive contradictions which
she conveniently argues away _outside of the system_, you can still
agree on some of the smaller stuff. You weren't ever going to convince
her that Elvis isn't living in a moon-hotel anyway.


&gt;<i> But maybe you could help us to write a tag interface that permit to

</I>
My coding time is limited, but I'll have a think about potential
design solutions - unless you already have one in mind?


&gt;&gt;<i> Ha - thanks - no, I realise I'm on the wrong side of this debate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wish I was able to admit when I was wrong this easily. Nice to have
</I>&gt;<i> you on board.
</I>
:<i>-)  I didn't admit I was wrong, just that I am probably wrong because
</I>greater minds than mine have tried and failed to make ontologies work.


&gt;&gt;<i> But - and here is where I'm going out on a limb - this is where I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think Bertrand Russell, Shirky and you miss a potential trick.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bertrand Russell? Fuck, I should really read all those books my
</I>&gt;<i> grandfather left me!
</I>
No need for fancy book-learnin' - the reference can be fully
understood by the following section:
