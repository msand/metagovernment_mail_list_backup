Hi Manuel,
I personally don't see this as a big problem.

It seem to me that a lot of failures are needed for a single great success
to appear. And wikipedia wasn't the first collaborative encyclopedia. It was
just the most succesful.

We built upon the experience one of the other, and I think we should
collaborate between us, and share ideas. But then we have this idea of the
wiki+karma system. I think that is new. Now I don't think they have this, or
are interested in using it, even as they know it. People tend to be
incredible possessive respect to 'their' software. So we should collaborate,
suggest to each other, invite users to participate and test all systems.
Maybe have a link page with a 'similar projects' section and I am pretty
sure different communities will end up using different systems. And so we
will test all those ideas, and get better over time.



&gt;<i> It would be great, if we could organize the different
</I>&gt;<i> projects to work from a common codebase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In a sense it would, but on the other it would take so much time just to
organise that. Time that can instead be used to code.

Cheers,
Pietro
