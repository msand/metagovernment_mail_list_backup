<PRE>Hi Manuel,
hi all.

On Fri, Aug 15, 2008 at 5:53 PM, Manuel Barkhau &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">mbarkhau at googlemail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

</I>&gt;<i> I would be interested to see that discussion group. Does it still

</I>
It would be interesting to have the software!
The project was tagsurf. I really believed in it.
I wrote about it here:
<A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/02/10/tagsurf-first-review/">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/02/10/tagsurf-first-review/</A>
and have the author among my friends on facebook, so we can contact
him. But I don't think he is willing to give away the code. He never
wanted it to become open source. :-/

I don't think the webpage is still there, but you might be able to
find something inthe web archives.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People only tag things they want to remember this is what we have learned in 5 years
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of using tags, also that people vote resources,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I had in mind when I came up with this, was the slashdot like
</I>&gt;<i> scoring. You're saying that a certain post is funny for example. Put a
</I>&gt;<i> different way, you are saying, that the attribute &quot;funny&quot; applies to
</I>&gt;<i> this post. I think this is largely a misunderstanding of terminology,
</I>&gt;<i> since I think you agree, we need a scoring mechanism beyond simple
</I>&gt;<i> tags.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The moderators on slashdot, don't have the egoistical incentive, of
</I>&gt;<i> organizing something for themselves, but they still do it. Maybe just
</I>&gt;<i> because they like expressing their opinion.
</I>
point taken, but slashdt is huge. to the point that they can permit
themselves to only be allowed to vote every now and then, and still
have enough voting weight. Most communities, and most communities
using our software will not be that big.


&gt;<i> I hope, that a political
</I>&gt;<i> debate, where scores determine what other people read, generates
</I>&gt;<i> enough egoistical motivation for the participants to do a few clicks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From a users perspective, I would hope it's the difference between &quot;I
</I>&gt;<i> agree with this post, so I'll click on the agree button&quot; and &quot;I think
</I>&gt;<i> the attribute agreeable applies to this post, therefore I will click
</I>&gt;<i> on the agree button&quot;. Which is to say, there is no difference, if you
</I>&gt;<i> set the interface up right. There is no reason, we couldn't make a
</I>&gt;<i> category of &quot;adjective&quot; tags and offer the same interface as slashdot.
</I>&gt;<i> Other tags would just be represented like delicious does. If you want
</I>&gt;<i> to bookmark a message, with a tag others have already used, it will
</I>&gt;<i> require just one click per tag.
</I>
Yes, it is interesting. After all in many political arena in italy
people just vote yes or no depending if the person is on their side or
against. This does not divide the interesting from the silly, but just
gives you the weight of the different side. Slashdot managed to permit
to the interesting to emerge. But this might be just because it is a
non politicial arena. Still I don't think this should be confused with
tags. If not we end up suggesting tags to people and all the measure
goes duh duh.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It was just not worth. People will not vote on each other tag;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but they will tag each other resources if they want to find them again,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and if they think that this will make it easier FOR THEM to find them back.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The measure of how much a tag is fit is then a side effect of that. How many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people agree on that tag.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, that an egoistic incentive, is necessary but I can't see how
</I>&gt;<i> negative feedback would be implemented here, apart from introducing
</I>&gt;<i> scoring mechanism, separate from tags. You could argue of course, that
</I>&gt;<i> somebody might tag something as &quot;stupid&quot;, but then again, you would
</I>&gt;<i> hardly want to find something like that again, so why would you give
</I>&gt;<i> it any tag at all?
</I>
So tags will help you ascetein the qualities of a resolution, what it
refers to, if it is funny, interesting, brave, or what.
If it refers to what part of the world or to what community, but it
will NOT tell you how much the tagger agrees with the resolution
itself.
For that we need a separate mechanism.
What tags also tells us is how many people are interested in that
resolution (number of people who have tagged / number of people who
have opened the page).
This is all tags tells us.

It is hard to have negative feedback, but then you can have a person
writing &quot;this is stupid&quot;, refering tot he first, and then people
tagging this second message as &quot;true&quot;. Also I remember when a man was
asking his wife to sign a bdsm contract before entering in a marriage,
and she chose not to marry him. The tags used contained quite clear
negative feedback toward his behaviour. So when people want to give
negative feedback they DO use tags. Also if people know that their tag
will be read also from this pov they will probably use them more.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Judging by your blog entry, you agree, that tags should have a weight,
</I>&gt;<i> just that they should follow a power law and the interface should be
</I>&gt;<i> simple, ie. the ordering determines their weight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First I'd like to suggest an interface for displaying the weight of a
</I>&gt;<i> tag. This could be done by underlying the tag with a bar of a certain
</I>&gt;<i> width or color with it's spectrum ranging from green to red. When
</I>&gt;<i> adding a tag, you can click on an existing one, as with the delicious
</I>&gt;<i> interface. The green component is then increased (probably with a
</I>&gt;<i> flash that eases off, to draw the attention of the user, that she is
</I>&gt;<i> distributing weights) and in accordance with the power law, the
</I>&gt;<i> components of the other tags she has selected are reduced.
</I>&gt;<i> The interface is reduced to one button for each existing tag and one
</I>&gt;<i> click per tag, and I can hardly imagine it being much simpler than
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>

yes, I think we are thinking in similar terms. Every time you add a
tag the weights of all the others is adjusted.

Under the list of tags we can see the weight as a series of bars, and
the user can modify them.
Of course if you modify one all the others go up or down to make sure
the summ is still 1. But what is important is that the default is a
power law, and it is a nomind to get the default.

But I like the idea of the bars. SO people know what they are doing.


Can we work on this together after the 25th. After the conference I am
speaking about in the other mail?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nonetheless, I would again like to emphasize, that we need more than
</I>&gt;<i> tags, to organize the resources. There has to be a way to interlink
</I>&gt;<i> messages, resolutions, revisions and votes. I would like to offer one
</I>&gt;<i> interface for all of this, which would simple be tags, that follow a
</I>&gt;<i> certain format. It will of course be hard to convince people to
</I>&gt;<i> manually type these tags, which I'm not expecting. Often you find on
</I>&gt;<i> mailing lists, that people type r1234 when refering to a specific
</I>&gt;<i> revision. Similarly, we can parse messages, try to determine, what
</I>&gt;<i> resources are mentioned and offer tags, underneath the post, so the
</I>&gt;<i> interface is again reduced to just one click, if any (you could
</I>&gt;<i> automatically append references which are obvious).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I agree. I just know the power of tags, and I very much like to
see it fully used which I STILL have not seen.
But then again, more and better can be done without tags.
For example. I like the idea that resolutions are not in a thread
mode, but in a network mode. Every one refering to all the ones that
it cites, and being linked to all the ones that it cites. Thinks about
the papers in the academia. But then we would need to have a way to
visualise that.

tags can link different resolutions probably (we could invent a
standard way to write a taglink:
res:c1243
means this refers to that resolution
and gives the command:
when I (the user) opens the resolution c1243 add this under. So the
user have the resolution that they want in the same page. They do this
by putting tags, and as an emerging effect we get the resolutions
ordered. We just need to find a way to let those tag:resolutions be
easy to add (not too many numbers to remember, etc).

How exciting all this!

I wish we make tagsurf come back to life!
As a community I think we can.

BTW, part of the problem with tagsurf was that they had nothing to
talk about. In a sense it was not clear how much tthe website was the
problem as it was clumsy, and how much was that there was no
community.


In any case if I need to contact the author I'll be very happy to do
it... after the 24th.

Cheers,
Pietro
