<PRE>&gt;<i> There was a website for some time that was a discussion group organised on
</I>&gt;<i> tags. It was a failure, you know why? because people would not tag single
</I>&gt;<i> messages.
</I>
I would be interested to see that discussion group. Does it still
exist? Is there any record of it?

&gt;<i> People only tag things they want to remember this is what we have learned in 5 years
</I>&gt;<i> of using tags, also that people vote resources,
</I>
What I had in mind when I came up with this, was the slashdot like
scoring. You're saying that a certain post is funny for example. Put a
different way, you are saying, that the attribute &quot;funny&quot; applies to
this post. I think this is largely a misunderstanding of terminology,
since I think you agree, we need a scoring mechanism beyond simple
tags.

The moderators on slashdot, don't have the egoistical incentive, of
organizing something for themselves, but they still do it. Maybe just
because they like expressing their opinion. I hope, that a political
debate, where scores determine what other people read, generates
enough egoistical motivation for the participants to do a few clicks.

&gt;<i>From a users perspective, I would hope it's the difference between &quot;I
</I>agree with this post, so I'll click on the agree button&quot; and &quot;I think
the attribute agreeable applies to this post, therefore I will click
on the agree button&quot;. Which is to say, there is no difference, if you
set the interface up right. There is no reason, we couldn't make a
category of &quot;adjective&quot; tags and offer the same interface as slashdot.
Other tags would just be represented like delicious does. If you want
to bookmark a message, with a tag others have already used, it will
require just one click per tag.

&gt;<i> It was just not worth. People will not vote on each other tag;
</I>&gt;<i> but they will tag each other resources if they want to find them again,
</I>&gt;<i> and if they think that this will make it easier FOR THEM to find them back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The measure of how much a tag is fit is then a side effect of that. How many
</I>&gt;<i> people agree on that tag.
</I>
I agree, that an egoistic incentive, is necessary but I can't see how
negative feedback would be implemented here, apart from introducing
scoring mechanism, separate from tags. You could argue of course, that
somebody might tag something as &quot;stupid&quot;, but then again, you would
hardly want to find something like that again, so why would you give
it any tag at all?

Judging by your blog entry, you agree, that tags should have a weight,
just that they should follow a power law and the interface should be
simple, ie. the ordering determines their weight.

First I'd like to suggest an interface for displaying the weight of a
tag. This could be done by underlying the tag with a bar of a certain
width or color with it's spectrum ranging from green to red. When
adding a tag, you can click on an existing one, as with the delicious
interface. The green component is then increased (probably with a
flash that eases off, to draw the attention of the user, that she is
distributing weights) and in accordance with the power law, the
components of the other tags she has selected are reduced.
The interface is reduced to one button for each existing tag and one
click per tag, and I can hardly imagine it being much simpler than
that.

Nonetheless, I would again like to emphasize, that we need more than
tags, to organize the resources. There has to be a way to interlink
messages, resolutions, revisions and votes. I would like to offer one
interface for all of this, which would simple be tags, that follow a
certain format. It will of course be hard to convince people to
manually type these tags, which I'm not expecting. Often you find on
mailing lists, that people type r1234 when refering to a specific
revision. Similarly, we can parse messages, try to determine, what
resources are mentioned and offer tags, underneath the post, so the
interface is again reduced to just one click, if any (you could
automatically append references which are obvious).
