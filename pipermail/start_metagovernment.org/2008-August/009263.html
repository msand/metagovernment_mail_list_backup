<PRE>Ok, I am finally free.
The talk went well, and soon it should be online at videolectures.net
In the talk I also spoke about metagovernment.

Interestingly I later received some critics from an aged professor
from east europe who claimed that any democracy where the people would
vote directly would be too shortsighted to work. Especially in this
historical moment when for the ecological situation we need to be
guided by people who can take risks.

I personally do not agree at all with his position. I don't agree that
politicians are not shortsighted, I don't agree that people are. But I
am refering the critic. As our project develop we will hear many
critics, but often we will hear on and on the same one. It would be
wise to look at them in depth, see if the contain a grain of truth,
and if they don't find a way to answer, and if they do, find a way to
include the truth, leaving aside the rest.

Said this,
I am finally on vacation, so Manuel, if you need help I am very happy
to join you in the programming business. How should we integrate? It
is the first open source project where I am collaborating (I did send
patches to others, in the past, but I was mostly collaborating from
the outside)

Pietro
