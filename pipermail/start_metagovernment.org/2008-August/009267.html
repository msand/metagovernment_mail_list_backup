I have encountered this criticism as well, and I have found that it is  
simply a result of thinking that the future will resemble the past.  
Open source governance is so radically different from other forms of  
governance that some of the old rules simply do not apply.

First, people don't really &quot;vote&quot; in Metascore, they contribute and  
they score. Second, the mechanisms we are trying to develop to promote  
synthesis make for a better solution than traditional decision-making.  
Instead of having to choose between one side or another, people can  
work together to make something that works for everyone.

And third, I completely agree with you that leaders don't have any  
special capability. Here in the U.S. our political leaders are  
completely, unabashedly short-sighted. I am sure many other countries  
experience similar politics. I see no advantage to having one person  
be in control instead of the entire community. As I noted here <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User_talk:Ironcoconut">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User_talk:Ironcoconut</A> 
  (follow-up forthcoming), the Quakers in the U.S. came to a consensus  
against slavery *seventy years* before the rest of the nation even  
started to act against slavery.
