<PRE>Thanks for pointing that out, Robert. When you put it that way, I also  
was concerned that I was being overly confident. It is certainly worth  
noting so that we can try to avoid that arrogance.

But I still do think that the future is going to be very, very  
different from the past. Sometimes technologies can make radical  
changes in society, particularly communications technologies. The  
telegraph and then the telephone made major changes to the world,  
creating instant links over vast distances. The internet and now Web  
2.0 technologies are making even greater changes. The fact that this  
group, scattered over a dozen or more countries, can even exist shows  
that there is something fundamentally different in the world. (And of  
course, there are larger, completely global communities, such as  
Wikipedia or Debian.) Communities are no longer bounded by geography,  
and one way or another governmental structures will have to start  
adapting to that reality.

The amazing thing about Web 2.0 is that it not only connects people,  
but it actively creates communities. It promotes collaboration and  
idea-sharing... it makes for structures which are greater than the sum  
of their parts. To compare that to old-school attempts at direct  
democracy is simply not valid. We do not know how Metascore will  
mutate when it is released into the wild, but we do know that, if we  
make it flexible enough, it has the potential to make something much,  
much more productive than a bunch of individuals screaming about their  
own personal problems.

</I>&gt;<i> ones who will see our failings most clearly.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RObert,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nice email.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I fully support the spirit of it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I now feel sorry of not having take the time to get the email fo the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> professor, although I doubt he would be interested in participating  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the discussion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Said this I also feel that Ed has a point. We are witnessing change.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Change in ways that has never happened. Now thinking that everything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be good from now on is silly. There will still be polarity (or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multipolarity), but the form this take can be radically different.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I felt this possibility was not there, I would not spend time in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributing to this project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let me share something personal, as a personal philosophy I follow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> taoism. I read, study taoist book, and I even practice taoist art  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (tai
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ch'i, for one). In Taoism there is a strong school that teaches not  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get dirty with the world of politics. That it is a dirty world, and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will stir you away from your true nature. But this school was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generated in China at the time of the warring state. In a time where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there was a state of nearly continuous war for hundreds of years.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Eventually the people got discouraged, and the best each could do was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cultivated their own field and go fishing. Now things are different.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> History changes. Although in some fundamental way life has something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar in every time, still some days are better than others, some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lives are better than others, and some historical periods are better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than others. And definitly different. There were times where slavery
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was common. Others where war was the rule. Or famine. Or global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> warming and extinctions(now).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The same professor, the day before, told me that when he went to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> zurich the first time (in the 70's) he saw how clean it was and he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thought that there must have been a real fear for authority. When he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> told me so he was laughing about himself, and how (at the time) he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could not conceive that people would be spontaneously clean. Can you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see how his own experience was putting a limit to what he could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conceive?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I strongly disagree that:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> history always had resembled the past. Every single anthropological
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> professor I talked to told me that he would not have wished to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lived in another time/place. Something must be different, thus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I feel and observe that history is changing the rules. There was a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time when there was no newspaper. Only gossip. Then newspaper  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arrived.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now blogs. A time when everybody can write their thought and have it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> read by many is different.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He also was discussing my talk, and I suspect that he understood it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a sort of internet direct democracy. Something like, every moring you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote on something. I had no time to enter in the details, so I just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spoke a about a wiki system with karma and voting on the changes. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't think he has any understainding of slashdot, although I suspect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he knows wikipedia.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SO I mostly feel on me the responsability for not having explained  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea better. Also I think his experience might be a limit, in htis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case. But I agree that we should keep on talking. But first let's get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something rolling. Do you do Python?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Ed/Metascore,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> History has taught us, however, that anyone who ignores advice  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> because &quot;this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> time it's different&quot; is often sorely mistaken.  :-)  The future  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will almost
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> certainly resemble the past.  It always has, which leads me to  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> suspect it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> always will.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Let's consider the aged professor.  Should we listen to him?  That  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> depends
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on whether or not we think he has wisdom.  He is old, so he has life
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> experience.  He is a professor, so he has studied and learned.  He  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lives in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Eastern Europe, so he has witnessed first-hand some of the most  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> radical and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> exciting changes in government our modern world has known.  He  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> almost
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> certainly has wisdom.  The fact we disagree is more likely a sign  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lack wisdom than it is a sign that he lacks wisdom.  Therefore we  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> listen to him.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do believe the metascoring system can overcome this (or I  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wouldn't be on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this mailing list), and I agreed wholeheartedly with the rest of  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> your email
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (not quoted here), but warn against any &quot;this time it's different&quot;  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> talk.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It's not different.  People are the same.  Only our tool is  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> different, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> if we want a different result from people who are the same, it  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> must be a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> very special tool indeed.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyways, not trying to be a wet blanket, just trying to inject a  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> little
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> historical perspective.
