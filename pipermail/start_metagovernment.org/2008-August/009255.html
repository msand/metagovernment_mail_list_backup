I don't have a problem with that... I have been characterizing it as  
&quot;rule by the willing&quot; or &quot;rule by the interested.&quot; As long as the  
community accepts Metascore as their legal governance structure, it  
doesn't matter how many people participate. If the community is OK  
with allowing one person to do all the work, then they can do so. And  
if later they decide that that person isn't working out anymore, other  
members of the community can jump in and immediately start  
participating in the governance of their community.

</I>
I'm not sure I am following you two here. I thought Manuel originally  
was implying that the scoring system _could_ be done through tags. Why  
can't tags have a weight from -10 to 10 (or whatever makes  
mathematical sense) and certain types of tags also lend their weight  
to the weight of the post to which they are assigned. In other words,  
a distinct class of &quot;scoring tag&quot; as opposed to a regular &quot;taxonomy  
tag.&quot;


P.S. At some point, when we've worked this through further, we need to  
update
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system</A>
and
