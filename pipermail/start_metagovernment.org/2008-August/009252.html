<PRE>As I suggested before, right now I am working on a small separate
project. Something on which I would like to receive everyody's input.

I am giving a talk on the international workshop on challenges and
visions in social sciences. Which also includes a summer school on
Modeling and Simulation for Young Scientists
<A HREF="http://www.soms.ethz.ch/workshop2008">http://www.soms.ethz.ch/workshop2008</A>

I have a tutorial for the summer school which will focus on tags, and
then this talk. I think this talk is very related to the interests of
this community.

The idea is that technological limitations tend to imply they kind of
democracy we generate in a society. Here is the abstract:



**************************************ABSTRACT*********************************
How should the 21st century democracy be organised? Studying online
communities to answer it.


Western democracies are mostly molded by technological limitations of
the 18th and 19th century.
For example in the United States the election of the president is an
indirect election where an Electoral College of 538 electors among the
fifty states is elected. Those people meet 40 days later in Washington
to elect the president. The reason for this delay was that 40 days was
the maximum time needed for a horseman to reach Washington, when the
system was set up. In Ireland the parliament only meets 2 days a week
to give to parliamentarians the time to go back to their hometown each
week end, to report and receive the requests of the people. A trip
that would take one day, again by horse.

Those limitations are everywhere, and far from being mere curiosities,
they define the way democracy works. As the technological revolution
of the web, and web2.0 progresses, new possible ways of organising
ourselves become possible. For the first time in history, for example,
it is possible to create a direct democracy of the size of a nation. A
nation where everybody would be called to vote for each single law.
Would such a state be desirable? Would it work well (if at all)? And
if it would not, what kind of democracy would, then, work well. Many
people in society are requesting a much stronger participation to the
democratic life of a country, beside voting for their preferred party.

To fully appreciate this problem we need to take one step back. Not
only democracy depends on the technological limitations, but so does
every social system. What the internet provides us is the biggest
experimental lab on the subject. Inside it countless communities can
be found. And the data about those communities is often available
(sometimes directly for free, sometimes after
after being requested to the administrator of a certain community).

&gt;<i>From discussion groups, to wikis (like Wikipedia), to blog and journal
</I>websites (like Wordpress.com and LiveJournal), to social network
websites (like Facebook and MySpace), to social bookmarking sites
(like Del.icio.us and Bibsonomy). All those sites define different
communities which range from tiny communities of only a handful of
individuals, to huge ones of millions.

Each of those communities follow different rules. Some rules depend on
the technological limitations of the software being used.
Other rules are imposed top-down by the administrator(s) of the
community. But all those rules impose a way in which people can
interact. Sub groups get formed. In some cases the community can lobby
the administrator for changes in the way the community is governed. In
some cases it is the full governance of the community itself that
emerges, while the administrator takes a more passive role. While in
others the social net among the user is too sparse for groups to be
able (or willing) to organise themselves. But interestingly it is the
way in which the community is set up that permits or not the emergence
of internal sub communities, lobby groups, and requests for change.

Yet the rules are not enough to explain the emergence of this picture.
Sometimes even communities with exactly the same rules do not always
grow up to be similar. In those cases the history of the community
plays an important role.

A similar situation happens in crystal, and snowflakes. The way in
which snowflakes grow depends both on the substratum, and on its
particular history. If you change either, the end result will change.
The study of snowflakes has improved thanks to the, relatively recent,
development of the study of fractal shapes. But what is interesting is
that snowflakes (and communities) should be studied in history. How
does a core (core group) grow in a particular substratum (under
certain rules).

While crystals grow in a 3 dimensional space, often in a fractal
shape, a community network grows as a graph. Many works are being
produced lately that study different communities. Showing how
different communities tend to have similar structures. Often with the
number of adjacent nodes following a power law and the graph itself
being a small world.

Rather than focusing on the similarities, we should study the way in
which communities are different, we should measure this and study how
such result is determined by the way the community is set up. What we
are suggesting is that there is a direct but not obvious causality
between the rules imposed and the emerging community. While a complete
understanding of such relationship might be unfeasible, yet any
partial understanding might be extremely helpful. The applications of
such study might in answering the question: what form could (and would
be desirable) a democracy of the 21st century take.

The talk, does not claim to have solved such important problem, but
aims, instead, at stirring the pot opening up a certain number of
unsolved questions; as well as suggesting possible future work in the
field.

To start to tackle this problem a series of characteristics that
define the possible type of communities should be listed, as well as a
list of possible studies that can be made to find out what kind of
social structure arise from the different social rules. How this can
then be used to help suggest ways in which democracy could be
integrated and modified with the online experience would then conclude
the talk.


********************************END ABSTRACT*********************************

SO I started preparing a slide show, a mindmap and a table. the slide
show will be the presentation,, with the mindmap being presented to
represent how the various communities differ, and then the table looks
at different example of communities and online services. (amazon,
delicious, facebook, livejournal, getfriday, wikipedia)
As I was doing it I realised how far away are those communities from
any form of democracy. Yes, they are different between them, but only
wikipedia of the 6 tries to be an authenthic democracy (although the
starter have a last say, if things go wrong).

I include the table and the mindmap (hoping that it works).

Unfortunately the power point is too big, and at the moment I have no
time to work this out.

What I would like to have are
a) feedback,
b) do you find the table, list of qualities to be clear enough?
c) do you know other communities that you think I should add, and do
you know them intimately enough to be able to compile the table for
them.

All together it seem to be the seed of an interesting work. As I said
in the abstract, but maybe with your help I could bring it one step
further.

Many thanks,
Pietro
