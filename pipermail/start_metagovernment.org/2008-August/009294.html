Ha - thanks - no, I realise I'm on the wrong side of this debate. Clay
Shirky, whom I have a great deal of respect for, wrote a very
compelling argument against ontologies and categorisation which is
very much worth the long read:
<A HREF="http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html">http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html</A>

But - and here is where I'm going out on a limb - this is where I
think Bertrand Russell, Shirky and you miss a potential trick.
Absolutely, static categorisation will always fail -- but
categorisation only needs to be static in a pre-computerised era.
Logical atomism, I believe, makes the mistake of trying to be 100%
accurate in its categorisations, which is like looking for God in a
microscope - it doesn't really make sense when you step back and think
about it.


&gt;<i> But the logical base of it, the aristothelean world view that things either are or are
</I>&gt;<i> not is a bit naive.
</I>
Agreed - but I don't subscribe to the all-or-nothing proposal that it
has to be all-or-nothing.

If you have a system that is only 51% accurate, but able to
dynamically modify itself, then you'll still never get to 100%
accuracy, but you might grow it to 99%, although likely lower. This
means that even if you cannot quantify its accuracy percentage against
a 'universal truthometer', you can know that you're on the path
towards getting there - which is something we don't have now. This is
the point at which I'd use Clay Shirky to argue against himself:
<A HREF="http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/03/09/one_world_two_maps_thoughts_on_the_wikipedia_debate.php">http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/03/09/one_world_two_maps_thoughts_on_the_wikipedia_debate.php</A>
 to argue that incremental changes can have significant value.

Anyway - none of this should have any bearing on how Metagovernment or
Metascore develops, not least because I am aware that I could be
spectacularly wrong, but also because I deeply believe in the power of
emergence to find the most useful strategy in this environment - that
we differ in some technophilosophical premises is a good thing!

Tagging folksonomies automatically tend to get you somewhere above 50%
accuracy, leveraging from external forms of consensus generation -
it's a good choice for Metagovernment because it's low-risk and thus
more likely to actually work.
