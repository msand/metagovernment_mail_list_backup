Manuel, please, I know you are the only one working on this right now (I am
actually working on a talk I will post about it today, here)
but do consider what the mathematician has to say.

It is waaay to complex to have people vote for each other tags.
People only tag things they want to remember
 this is what we have learned in 5 years of using tags,
also that people vote resources,
but voting on tags, is like asking people to vote on other people votes.

Yes we do need to have a measure of how tags fit a certain resolution, and
it should be a rational number.

There was a website for some time that was a discussion group organised on
tags.
It was a failure, you know why? because people would not tag single
messages.
It was just not worth. People will not vote on each other tag;
but they will tag each other resources if they want to find them again,
and if they think that this will make it easier FOR THEM to find them back.

The measure of how much a tag is fit is then a side effect of that. How many
people agree on that tag.

This suggests that all the tags that people add are inserted with equal
strength. This is not the only solution, and I will propose another solution
soon. But if we assume that all tags are equal we still  need to make a
decision:
if a person put more tags, does each tag has less weight (1/number of tags)?

Or do all the tags all have the same weight (1)?

This is an important decision, and on this we should consider the two
alternatives. Because on this we push people to use less tags (thus adding
less information, but we are more protected versus spam)

But there is another possibility, something I have been theorethising from a
long time, and that is that once you put the tags the weight of each tag is
not always the same.

The complex way would be to let you assign the weight for each tag, but this
is way too complex too. Let us remember that tagging have to be a fast
process. The slower it is the less people will do it, and the less tags will
represent the community, and will represent few person who have a lot of
passion on the topic (good) and a lot of time on their hands (bad).

So the solution I suggested in my blog was that the order of the tag became
important.
Since we know that
a) tags follow a power law (this by now have already been shown many times)
b) the power law have a steepness of 1.1
c) the total weight of the tags given by one person have to be a constant,
and equal to 1. (in this case there is no doubt)

then we can just calculate the weight of each tag so thet they fit the above
requirements. And the solution is unique.

But I am worried that having people vote for each other tag is going one
level of meta control too high. People will not use it, you will have lost
time, the community will lose people and drive, and something which could
have been done in a simpler and efficient way end up falling by being too
complicated.

What could be done to let people have a higher degree of control is, on the
GUI level explain to the user how the tags are being valued, what is the
actual value, and what will be the next value once they chose theirs. So
they can ignore or not ignore the information. But the information is always
the same: a(n ordered) list of tags. Nothing more, nothing less. Easy peasy.

Hope this helps. Soon I will be able to help you more proactively.

Pietro

P.S. Where did I suggest the solution:
