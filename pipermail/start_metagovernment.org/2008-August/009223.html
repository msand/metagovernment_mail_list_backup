<PRE>References to our project have appeared in blogs, discussion boards,  
SlashDot, Wikipedia, and websites about democracy. But to my  
knowledge, we had not yet attracted the attention of the &quot;mainstream  
press.&quot;

However, this week San Francisco Magazine published an article on the  
new prospects being opened by Web 2.0... and the Metagovernment  
project got a paragraph, which encapsulates the project quite well:

&quot;Legislation by open source? The project is still in development, but  
the creators of Metagovernment envision a software platform that would  
let citizens engage directly in legislative duties, relying on a  
system of &#8220;rating-based weighting&#8221; to ensure that only merited ideas  
were seriously considered. That&#8217;s right: No more politicians.  
metagovernment.org&quot;

The mainstream press hasn't been a target of publicity, since we need  
something substantial before we have anything that would really  
capture the attention of the masses. Nonetheless, it is nice to see  
that we are getting noticed.

Here is the article:
