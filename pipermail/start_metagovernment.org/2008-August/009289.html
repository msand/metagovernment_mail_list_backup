I think the reason that keeping tags and categories separate seems
sensible, is that otherwise you'd need something like a prolog
interpreter to make sense of it all -- it's kind of all-or-nothing as
simple tags like &quot;apple&quot; or &quot;orange&quot; don't map 1:1 into categories.
But even with general categories, static-mapping is going to trip you
up if enough of your users decide that a tag now means something
slightly (but significantly) different than it did last week.

I like the value/position/policy structure - there seems to be great
power in the layered concepts approach. I don't like the fact that it
seems (?) to require a lot of human intervention to maintain
consistency. But I didn't delve deeper to see how it deals with issues
like users contradicting themselves, so that might be overstated.

To take an example from recent American politics - the argument:
&quot;someone that might be President must have many years of foreign
policy experience&quot; (value) applied against Obama (position) and
against voting Democrat (policy). That now could be equally applied
against Sarah Palin, and McCain by extension. Ie. you can't
(logically) support either candidate and uphold that value and thus
leverage the position against their opponent. Or you can, but it
either means the user or value is broken - bad news for the system if
it can't automatically detect that, as it has the potential to devolve
into a partisan vote-fest.

I'm unclear how Metagovernment would handle a similar problem.

One approach might be to address such contradictions as and when they
come up, but that is a considerable overhead, especially if you are
dealing with users who are trying to game the system in non-obvious
ways, and you still have the partisan vote-fest problem.


&gt;&gt;<i> That said, over a hundred pages of scribbled notes and all I have to

</I>
Cheers! I've never used a mindmap, although it's been on my todo list
for a while. I'm not proud of that UI - it does a _terrible_ job of
explaining how individual units affect the whole. I did, though, want
to explore what options there were for escaping the linear-threaded
concept by demonstrating relationships more dynamically, and it's a
good toy for my purposes for doing that!

Interesting - it's encouraging when similar conclusions are reached
from different starting points.
