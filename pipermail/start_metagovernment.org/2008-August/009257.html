<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I am following you two here. I thought Manuel originally
</I>&gt;<i> was implying that the scoring system _could_ be done through tags. Why
</I>&gt;<i> can't tags have a weight from -10 to 10 (or whatever makes
</I>&gt;<i> mathematical sense) and certain types of tags also lend their weight
</I>&gt;<i> to the weight of the post to which they are assigned. In other words,
</I>&gt;<i> a distinct class of &quot;scoring tag&quot; as opposed to a regular &quot;taxonomy
</I>&gt;<i> tag.&quot;
</I>


Tags do have a weight. If we are using a tag set is equal to 0 if a
tag is mentioned, or 1 if it IS mentione.
If we assume that each user inserts a tag cloud, we have a rational
number between 0 and 1.
And you can get them as a power law, which makes it easy to insert, or
let users tweak the numbers which makes it hard for them, but
supposedly better for the scoring (I deny that, but that is another
story).
Or you can just use the power law as the default, and the user can
tweak the results if the want to.

WHich is what we are moving toward.



But then you are asking something else:

&gt;<i> certain types of tags also lend their weight
</I>&gt;<i> to the weight of the post to which they are assigned. In other words,
</I>&gt;<i> a distinct class of &quot;scoring tag&quot; as opposed to a regular &quot;taxonomy
</I>&gt;<i> tag.&quot;
</I>

now this is a problem. Yes there are some tags that will also have a
non zero correlation with the result of a voting.
If a resolution gets tagged with genius, good, great, brilliant we can
expect it to be accepted.
If it gets tagged with stupid, silly, wtf-was_he_thinking, probably not.

Still using the first to predict the second is hard in the general case.
And using the first to ascertein the second is ...
hmm, not  a good idea.

The reason is, people use different tags. Different languages.
Tags also are a multidimansional space. n tags--&gt; n dimensions.
Voting is unidimensional... often.
In any case much less dimensions are considered to plot the results of
the voting.

Now, how each tag projects on the voting_result axis is dependent on
the issue at hand.
When the tag 'good' might weight 0.9 in a certain resolution, which
means that we can multiply the people who voted it as good for 0.9 to
have a number of people who would vote for it to be used, it might
have a totally different weight for a different problem, for a
different solution (of the same problem) or just for a different
wording of the same solution.

Or to repeat the immortal words:
carefull with that axe Eugene

;-)

So the tagging is good to organise the information.
Is good to find what is related to what.
It can even be used to decide how much of the karma of one resolution
should go to the next resolution.

But I would ascetein, at least for now, to let the people vote by
tagging things.

Let's keep the tagging and the voting separated.
But let's also permit to people to tag things with different weight.

Cheers,
Pietro
