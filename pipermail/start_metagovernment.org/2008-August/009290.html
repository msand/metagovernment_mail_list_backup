Great, welcome, then we are on the same page.

No, no, no,, stop stop stop.

categories are not ok. Are not ok in general and are not ok in
particular in a shared government. The problem with categories is that
either you need to have a single onthology to which everybody is
forced to adhere or a set of onthologies and interfaces between them.
BUT
if we could agree in the onthologies then there would be no need for a
government at all. We would simply share the same world view.
The semantic web people have tried this route so long, and failed. It
only works in limited places, where everybody agrees on the onthology,
and who does not agree is conveniently branded as a dissident, and
thrown out of the community.
Think the medical profession. You need years to train an average
person to be a person who can use the categories of doctors, and then
you are branding a whole set of people (witch doctors, acupunturists,
any alternative health practitioner) as wrong.

If instead you want to have a different onthology for each person (or
school), say you have n school of thoughs (or n people), then you are
bound to have to develop n*(n-1)/2 types of description on how to go
from each onthology to the next. That goes up as n^2 and is simply too
much. Plus as soon as one of those descriptions get defined, you
probably will have a small revolutions, as the people of one school
just do not agree with how they map with in the world view of the
other onthology. Plus then you need to define when you apply one and
when you apply the other onthology.

Sorry, but all this does not work. It would increase the workload a
lot and give no exernal benefit.

Categories where the way to implement an onthology when we could not
see that society by itself has its own emerging onthology. It did not
work. I have hundreds of examples.

Sorry Richard, I enjoy having you here, but the idea of onthologies is
just what we are going away from.

Think about: a person has a really high karma in law, and a low karma
in medicine. There is a law passing, and is about &quot;medical rights&quot;.
SHould it be under medicine or should it be under law. I want it under
law, doctors want it under medicine. Here is a second problem with
categories, people tend to assign things to one and only one category.
And even when they assign things to more than one category, then you
need to define the relative weight. And here we go again, we need then
to ask people to vote for the relative weight. But this is already
what we do in with broad folksonomy tags. Plus you are letting also
assign new categories.

No guys, tags, wide folksonomy, measure of the distance between
resources on the base of tags.
We have this all, we have the papers that shows that is possible.
Let's just implement it. And then we HAVE an emergent onthology. But
no one is in charge to define what is what. We all are.






&gt;&gt;<i> That said, over a hundred pages of scribbled notes and all I have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually show is a silly demo where I'm trying out different UI layout
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concepts with nonsensical premises: (
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://thedeviousplot.com:7358/t3/">http://thedeviousplot.com:7358/t3/</A> )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the interface! I don't entirely get it at first glance, but it
</I>&gt;<i> has some intuitiveness to it. I am interested to see Pietro's
</I>&gt;<i> response, as he works extensively with mindmaps...
</I>
The interface is great. And with Richard help it might be interesting
to have something similar. But the logical base of it, the
aristothelean world view that things either are or are not is a bit
naive. Maybe we could have something similar to connect the various
resources, if there is a program that automatically given a graph can
find a configuration that lowers the number of cross links.
Also the idea of having something that is goes inside the other is not
bad. Again this could be used when people try to rewrite a resource.
But we have to pay very much attention. Again it has a boolean point
of view, while you can have a resource that is substituting x others.
So is not so simple.

But I am happy that Richard came to work with us, he obviously is able
to do some really nice interface. I hope that my attack to his idea
will not push him out. I am attacking the idea, not the person.


Cheers,
Pietro
