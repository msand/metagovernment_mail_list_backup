wonderful! Then you can help us!!

I just got my copy of the mercurial. or similar.

Regarding how the dot.com was a bubble can I invite you (all) to see
the presentation at ted.com from Chris Anderson.
<A HREF="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/chris_anderson_of_wired_on_tech_s_long_tail.html">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/chris_anderson_of_wired_on_tech_s_long_tail.html</A>
He explains how each new technology goes through 4 phases, and th
dot.com bubble was just one of those phases. But under the bubble the
real value of the dotcom kept on raising.
That's because expectations raise faster than the technology itself.
But then while the bubble burst the technology keeps on raising. And
then it catches up.

P.S. I think it was that talk. I am right now on internet through 4k
telephone. SO I can't really check.

Cheers,
Pietro
