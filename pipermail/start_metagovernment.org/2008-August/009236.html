This seems to be something like the strategy of the Israeli MyVote and  
the Sweedish Aktivdemokrati and Demoex. I have to imagine that there  
are other similar local/national movements starting up as well.

In the worst case, Metagovernment could be a clearinghouse for these  
groups to share ideas. But I think that if we can get some viable code  
running, we really do have a better proposition.

Nonetheless, there's nothing stopping us from working with national  
campaigns... our only real difference with these two American groups  
is in the software. Other groups which have not developed code would  
be well served by ours... assuming we had it.

I have started trying to get in touch with any programmers I know  
(few, as I.T. is a world apart from programming) and with anyone I  
know who might know programmers -- and asking them to help Manuel (or  
Aur, though Manuel has been more vocal in requesting help).

I strongly urge anyone in this group capable of programming to see if  
you can directly help Manuel, and I urge everyone in this group to  
contact any programmers you may know to see if they can be engaged in  
helping with the code development.
