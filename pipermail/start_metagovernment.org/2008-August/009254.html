<PRE>I'm not going into very much detail, I'll just give you some ideas that popped in my head.

If you want to take a historical perspective, you might consider also the how discussion groups on the internet have evolved. Starting with usenet, mailing lists and irc, and trying to find there limitations so we can see the direction we are online communities and communication mechanisms are evolving. 

IRC for example, is still great for things like tech-support, or a group of people on a project, who want to coordinate work. A certain aspect of that, is that you just stay in a channel and post messages as you go, which now has a similar counterpart on the web, called twitter. These kind of informal interactions are great for fostering a community. You can feel more like you're there when things are happening, rather than reading about it after the fact as with a mailing list. It reduces the distance, which is created when communications are limited to the written word. There is more of a sense, that you are actually interacting with a human being on the other end.

On that note, you can look at youtube, which has again reduced the distance between people in the same sense. 

It's also interesting to see what kind of communities develop around different sites. I think you can judge for example, by the kind of content that is promoted on digg, that its community, is mostly made up of people which have allot of time, ergo teenage boys with nothing better to do than post lolcat pictures and the like. Still among that vast amount of what I would consider spam, there are a few jems that manage to bubble up. Contrast that with the slashdot community, which I really find fascinating. Not so much for the site, but for the people that visit. On example I remember is a post with the following disclaimer: &quot;IAALE (I am a lithography engineer)&quot;. Now there is no way for me to verify that of course, but first of all, I'm willing to believe that statement, because it would have been followed up, by somebody scrutinizing the statements that were made, if it weren't the case and secondly, because there are actually well known members of the tech community known to frequent slashdot. The thing I find most fascinating about that post, was that you couldn't have found a better person to discuss the topic if you had looked and payed for them. 

I'm not sure what you can get out of this for your talk apart from maybe that setting the tone on the discussion board and determining what kind of behaviour you expect in a community is probably more important that the technologies it uses. Certainly the content will reflect the values of the members, the important aspect is that we find effective ways to organize and navigate that content so different aspects of a large community can be explored and not be buried between the content of the lowest common denominator.

There's kind of an interesting balance to be formed here. You want to give the community tools to help keep the discussion effective, for example by blocking out spam. On the other hand, this may result in isolated communities, without any communication between them, further upholding stereotypes and prejudice. This is sort of hand waving, and I have no data to back this up, the contrary may in fact be true, because you can post anonymously and the distance between the communities may be only a few clicks. I'm not sure, just something to consider.

Then you might want to take a look at existing communities, which actually produce something, like for example kernel.org. I'm not an expert on how they work, from what I hear, the lkml isn't the most pleasant place to have a discussion. Here's a quote from Linus himself: &quot;Security people are often the black-and-white kind of people that I can't stand. I think the OpenBSD crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys,...&quot;. This is of course out of context and the rest of the post had some good points. While not the most friendly, for the personalities of the developers, it may be the right kind of atmosphere. I mean it at least seems honest, and while there may be flaming, it's really just a matter of how you read it. Ultimately it does seem like a productive discussion, so you might want to take a look at how they work.

Another wonderful aspect of these communities is the really democratic nature of participation. How much your contributions are valued is mostly dependent on your effort and the merit of your work. There are of course politics in these communities too (I suppose also in ours), but at least campaign contributions and the pursuit of a political career aren't the driving factors behind the members. A good example are those who are genuinely interested in the work of the community, such as companies contributing code to the kernel. Well we've talked about this before at length, so I won't go on, just wanted to mention the whole open source aspect that we can learn from.


I suppose I don't need to tell you about tagging, but I have a geeky metaphor that might be useful to you, though I can't remember exactly where I got it from.

In a supermarket, in which isle do you put the milk? You could put it next to the serials, because people buying those, will obviously want milk. Maybe you should put it with other dairy products like cheese and yoghurt. Another place might be with other beverages, because that's obviously a category it belongs to. The only reason we can't put it in all those places, is because of the physical limitations of the universe and space-time we live in. We only have 3 or 4 dimensions (for the purposes of this message at least), so the milk can only be in one place. On the internet, there is no such inherent limitation. With tags we can give any object as many dimensions as we want, so that it is always right next to its related items.

I think this also applies to the threaded view of a discussion, which I'm not particularly fond of. I think it's a metaphor born out of the limitations of screen real estate. I hope we can come up with a better representation of discussions.


Which brings me back to the limitation of the written word, the main channel of the internet, in comparison with a live conversation. In one sense, it's a good thing, because it acts as a filter, for those who aren't willing to thing things through and dedicate time to formulating there thoughts. The discussions take longer, but are maybe more effective. Then again you really want to put the filter at a higher level and collect as much content as possible. 


Well I hope there was something useful in there for you.

ciao
Manuel
