<PRE>I Skyped Taylor Norrish, the developer of GovIt.org, and spoke with him
about the differences in our approaches. He is certainly an action oriented
individual who is looking to empower the people with tools to influence
their Government. I introduced him to the Metagovernment Project and his
response sounded much like Ed's response: that we're facing the same
solution from two different angles.

Personally, I've fallen in love with Free Government, as this aligns with
the first step, in my mind, that we need to take in order to enact a Free
and Open Government. We need to replace the current power structures,
however they might currently exist, with Representatives that vote according
to the decisions of their constituients.

As long as we can get a few of those Representatives in place by 2010 -- at
least here in the United States, according to Free Government's plan of
action -- we'll have the perfect platform on which to launch MetaGovernment!
