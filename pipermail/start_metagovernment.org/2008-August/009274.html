<PRE>RObert,
nice email.

I fully support the spirit of it.

I now feel sorry of not having take the time to get the email fo the
professor, although I doubt he would be interested in participating in
the discussion.


Said this I also feel that Ed has a point. We are witnessing change.
Change in ways that has never happened. Now thinking that everything
will be good from now on is silly. There will still be polarity (or
multipolarity), but the form this take can be radically different.

If I felt this possibility was not there, I would not spend time in
contributing to this project.

Let me share something personal, as a personal philosophy I follow
taoism. I read, study taoist book, and I even practice taoist art (tai
ch'i, for one). In Taoism there is a strong school that teaches not to
get dirty with the world of politics. That it is a dirty world, and it
will stir you away from your true nature. But this school was
generated in China at the time of the warring state. In a time where
there was a state of nearly continuous war for hundreds of years.
Eventually the people got discouraged, and the best each could do was
cultivated their own field and go fishing. Now things are different.

History changes. Although in some fundamental way life has something
similar in every time, still some days are better than others, some
lives are better than others, and some historical periods are better
than others. And definitly different. There were times where slavery
was common. Others where war was the rule. Or famine. Or global
warming and extinctions(now).

The same professor, the day before, told me that when he went to
zurich the first time (in the 70's) he saw how clean it was and he
thought that there must have been a real fear for authority. When he
told me so he was laughing about himself, and how (at the time) he
could not conceive that people would be spontaneously clean. Can you
see how his own experience was putting a limit to what he could
conceive?

So I strongly disagree that:
history always had resembled the past. Every single anthropological
professor I talked to told me that he would not have wished to have
lived in another time/place. Something must be different, thus.

I feel and observe that history is changing the rules. There was a
time when there was no newspaper. Only gossip. Then newspaper arrived.
Now blogs. A time when everybody can write their thought and have it
read by many is different.

He also was discussing my talk, and I suspect that he understood it as
a sort of internet direct democracy. Something like, every moring you
vote on something. I had no time to enter in the details, so I just
spoke a about a wiki system with karma and voting on the changes. I
don't think he has any understainding of slashdot, although I suspect
he knows wikipedia.

SO I mostly feel on me the responsability for not having explained the
idea better. Also I think his experience might be a limit, in htis
case. But I agree that we should keep on talking. But first let's get
something rolling. Do you do Python?

</I>&gt;<i> History has taught us, however, that anyone who ignores advice because &quot;this

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's consider the aged professor.  Should we listen to him?  That depends

</I>&gt;<i> experience.  He is a professor, so he has studied and learned.  He lives in
</I>&gt;<i> Eastern Europe, so he has witnessed first-hand some of the most radical and
</I>&gt;<i> exciting changes in government our modern world has known.  He almost
</I>&gt;<i> certainly has wisdom.  The fact we disagree is more likely a sign that we
</I>&gt;<i> lack wisdom than it is a sign that he lacks wisdom.  Therefore we should
</I>&gt;<i> listen to him.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do believe the metascoring system can overcome this (or I wouldn't be on
</I>&gt;<i> this mailing list), and I agreed wholeheartedly with the rest of your email
</I>&gt;<i> (not quoted here), but warn against any &quot;this time it's different&quot; talk.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not different.  People are the same.  Only our tool is different, and
</I>&gt;<i> if we want a different result from people who are the same, it must be a
</I>&gt;<i> very special tool indeed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyways, not trying to be a wet blanket, just trying to inject a little
</I>&gt;<i> historical perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Robert Peters
