<PRE>Yet another similar project has come to my attention (their founder  
just wrote me, and I'll be writing back soon):
<A HREF="http://www.democracylab.org/">http://www.democracylab.org/</A>
This appears to be another United States-only project. It isn't worded  
that way as much, but it is a US corporation and seems to be about US  
issues.

Note I have updated this page:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects</A>

Although I dislike that all these projects are dividing our collective  
focus, I am very encouraged that this movement is clearly gaining  
traction. It looks like we are creating a competitive marketplace of  
ideas, and it will be up to the internet to decide which of these  
ideas will gain prominence.

So far, each of the other organizations we have encountered is nation- 
centric and works as a supplement to the status quo. I believe the  
Metagovernment project remains distinguished on these points: we are  
entirely global (and entirely local in our initial implementations),  
and we are an outright replacement for representative democracies, not  
a supplement. I believe that our plan of running Metascore first in  
tiny, barely-formal communities and then letting it grow organically  
is a great plan for success.

But I think many of us also want to see these other types of  
organizations succeed. As long as we have representative democracies,  
at least they could have some Web 2.0 input, instead of still relying  
on the &quot;smoke-filled rooms&quot; of yore.

In any event, we should continue to try to find synergies with these  
other groups, and continue to look for ways we can combine our efforts.
