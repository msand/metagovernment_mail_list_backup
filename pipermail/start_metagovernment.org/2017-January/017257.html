It helps, but turnout in Boulder for the election in November was only
75% (and that's just adults: I'd like to start including the
preferences of at least teenagers, and probably eventually even much
younger kids, based on their personality profiles which can be fairly
reliably determined even in pre-school-aged kids), and I'd have to
consider this an absolute maximum because it had just about everything
going for it:
1) *Lots* of outreach to get people registered (volunteers everywhere,
motor/voter (you can register to vote automatically when you get your
drivers license), constant reminders to do this in the local papers
and on the local TV station, etc.)

2) All mail-in election (no reasonable time/effort excuse).

3) It's in the top 10 counties in the US on most measures of affluence
and education.

4) Besides the presidential election there were several very
contentious referendums including a tax on sugar in drinks which
*everybody* seemed to have an opinion on.

Even losing 25% of neurotypicals (which probably applies to the vast
majority of those who fail to vote) is way too much IMHO: It's fairly
easy to achieve authoritarian activation of 38% of humans (half of
75%), so we really need *everyone* to vote if we're to end SDAP-rule.
