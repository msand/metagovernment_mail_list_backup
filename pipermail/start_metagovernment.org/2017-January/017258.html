<PRE> &quot;If it's a chronic problem *never* vote and just say you don't on
principle: With
this system even if you never even log in after setting up your
profile you'll *still* end up with vastly better representation that
you're getting now. The only way to corrupt the operation of the
system in that case would be for the coercer to provide a complete
personality profile and require everyone to change theirs to match. I
find it hard to conceive that anyone would try to do that...&quot;

-I'd like to know more about this system, how would it not be used by
religions to claim they have democracies in places where it's not safe to
even talk about particular human rights? I'd like to hear your process on
that and what the algorithm's based on. I'm also curious if you see that as
a potential open source technology.



&quot;even if you never even log in after setting up your
profile you'll *still* end up with vastly better representation that
you're getting now.&quot;

I think with the right set up DD can help change creep in as long as it's
proving effective elsewhere. Earlier today I heard from someone who thought
we expected everyone to just hop on board from day one, like that was
necessary or even possible. It starts with a really solid design that
succeeds in creating communities that thrive and expand.

Plus even if the majority ruled they really would still be at least
thinking about sustainability/not killing themselves. Even a tyranny of the
majority beats self-extinction. But also that when we try appealing to
people in power, we often forget that those people's hands are seriously
tied. And that our interests involve big players making less money
otherwise it wouldn't be a problem. So at least when we have to appeal to
'majorities' things like compassion, respect for dignity, and self respect
can actually come into play. The bottom line isn't money, and any proposed
forms of oppression will be visible to everyone as well as increasingly
subject to their criticisms.

Plus before full scale implementation DD can be used to create global
accords, so if some community of shitheads tries making slavery or
something else that violates the global accords, we can sanction, boycott
and all kinds of other things to make that option too expensive for them.
Especially if instead of fighting to get them ruled by our choice of rulers
we're simply saying basic, highly defensible things like 'no slavery'. If
people try making global pacts that are too nitpicky it'll be easy for
others to argue we should respect localities sovereignty and that global
pacts are for basic human rights.

I think we need to start making better infographics. We're reaching the
Galileo stage of this movement where we know the answers to our critics
better than they do. If we all start making solid explanatory media then we
can start hitting the culture wars hard. Like a movement truly for and by
the people should be!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we also contextualize.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It helps, but turnout in Boulder for the election in November was only
</I>&gt;<i> 75% (and that's just adults: I'd like to start including the
</I>&gt;<i> preferences of at least teenagers, and probably eventually even much
</I>&gt;<i> younger kids, based on their personality profiles which can be fairly
</I>&gt;<i> reliably determined even in pre-school-aged kids), and I'd have to
</I>&gt;<i> consider this an absolute maximum because it had just about everything
</I>&gt;<i> going for it:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) *Lots* of outreach to get people registered (volunteers everywhere,
</I>&gt;<i> motor/voter (you can register to vote automatically when you get your
</I>&gt;<i> drivers license), constant reminders to do this in the local papers
</I>&gt;<i> and on the local TV station, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) All mail-in election (no reasonable time/effort excuse).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) It's in the top 10 counties in the US on most measures of affluence
</I>&gt;<i> and education.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Besides the presidential election there were several very
</I>&gt;<i> contentious referendums including a tax on sugar in drinks which
</I>&gt;<i> *everybody* seemed to have an opinion on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even losing 25% of neurotypicals (which probably applies to the vast
</I>&gt;<i> majority of those who fail to vote) is way too much IMHO: It's fairly
</I>&gt;<i> easy to achieve authoritarian activation of 38% of humans (half of
</I>&gt;<i> 75%), so we really need *everyone* to vote if we're to end SDAP-rule.
