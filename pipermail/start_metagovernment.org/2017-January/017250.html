Well, at least prepare counter-arguments and design our systems to try
to prevent these types of failures (unlikely as they may be).

But along with that stuff about Liquid Democracy, there were also a
couple of cites of the Swiss system being an example of a
dysfunctional Direct Democracy (specifically the anti-minarets
proposal passing, which is often classified as an example of &quot;tyranny
of the majority&quot;). California Prop 8 (anti-gay-rights) passing was
another one I saw.  But IMHO those are bad examples for one of the
same reasons misrepresentative democracy doesn't work: Proposals are
passed (or candidates elected) by only about a quarter of the
population, which effectively allows conservatives and other
authoritarians to set public policy. They're only about a quarter of
the population but have vastly higher turnout rates, distorting the
resulting decisions.

I'm not really thrilled with this paper because of the methodology
(they basically use the experimental method itself to create a
&quot;control condition&quot;), but I cite it anyway because it shows that at
least the &quot;correct vote&quot; part of the Swiss system seems to work, which
is all I/we need:

Yeah, it's a long-term kind of project. Maybe generations (though I hope not).

Sounds good, and would be a useful resource for anyone working on new
decisionmaking systems.
