I suppose, although it's disappointing to seem the same tired cliches
about why direct democracy can't work still being rehashed over and
over. And the few people on that list, and the writers of the original
article and the one that seemed to most influence her, who seem to at
least grasp that our current misrepresentative democracies are just
fundamentally fatally flawed don't realize that their proposed
solution (a derivative of liquid democracy) has exactly the same flaws
(low voter turnout, highly disproportional power given to &quot;activerts&quot;,
etc.) and has been convincingly shown can't work either (i.e., by the
Pirate Party as documented by Kling et. al.).

They also seem to not appreciate the &quot;magical&quot; quality that government
has: If a majority of people *believe* that a new system is the
legitimate government of an area, it simply *becomes* the legitimate
government of that area. All we need to get people to realize is that
this concept deserves the same level of faith (even to the point of
devotion) they have granted the idea that technology can solve these
problems.

For your convenience, here are the two articles:
