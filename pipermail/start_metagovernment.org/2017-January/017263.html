Agreed: A controlled experiment is always better. Good luck with that ;-)

I disagree with the characterization and example: Everyone has &quot;stake&quot;
in aviation safety, as they never know when they're going to have to
fly and certainly don't want planes falling on their houses. But the
same is true of *every* public policy decision: I'm not a woman, but I
have a &quot;stake&quot; in deciding what a moral abortion policy is. I don't
have any school-age children, but have a &quot;stake&quot; in how our education
system works and on tax allocation to pay for them. All using the term
&quot;stakeholder&quot; does is allow some people to claim extra privilege.
Unfortunately, as it turns out, it's usually exactly the *wrong*
people to be deferring those decisions to because they are exactly the
people who will abuse those privileges. Allowing &quot;stakeholders&quot; to
define policy is merely an expediency because government doesn't want
to have to deal with them complaining about how they're being treated.
But as long as we can control SDAP influence and thereby ensure that
neurotypicals are making the decisions, they will by definition be
&quot;fair&quot; because it will reflect human needs and human nature and won't
be just the result of some group or personality type gaming the
system.
  Regards,
    Scott
