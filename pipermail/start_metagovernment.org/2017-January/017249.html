<PRE>&quot;it's disappointing to seem the same tired cliches
about why direct democracy can't work still being rehashed over and
over.&quot;

I think this is a valuable opportunity for us, don't let this get you down.
Every true revolution in human history was called crazy or impossible so
this, is really just another part of our challenge. We can sift through
their laughable bullshit for recurrent themes and actually use this to our
advantage.

 The more any one of us does this, the more all of us have more material to
call upon. Be it simple memes that address or mock arguments, or complex
graphic illustrations. This is the work our species needs, don't let their
initial stupidity get you down. -it was like this for the first scientists
too.

I'm going to start creating more media myself, I'm trying to start with
natural questions like the ones they're posing because that's how normal
people's brains 'enter' the subject.

</I>&gt;<i> fundamentally fatally flawed don't realize that their proposed

</I>&gt;<i> (low voter turnout, highly disproportional power given to &quot;activerts&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) and has been convincingly shown can't work either (i.e., by the
</I>&gt;<i> Pirate Party as documented by Kling et. al.).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They also seem to not appreciate the &quot;magical&quot; quality that government
</I>&gt;<i> has: If a majority of people *believe* that a new system is the
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate government of an area, it simply *becomes* the legitimate
</I>&gt;<i> government of that area. All we need to get people to realize is that
</I>&gt;<i> this concept deserves the same level of faith (even to the point of
</I>&gt;<i> devotion) they have granted the idea that technology can solve these
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
