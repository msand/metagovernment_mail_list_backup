<PRE>I think one thing that's needed is understanding that some problems can
work themselves out. People don't bother voting because they see it as
pointless, and current legislation is written in legalese and are all made
by pro-establishment parties. Once we're asking them to tune into what
their own communities are doing, to the questions Their communities find
important, 'voter turn out' becomes a different ball game. When we localize
we also contextualize.

&gt;<i> One thing that I gleaned from this discussion that I perhaps glossed over
</I>&gt;<i> before, is the notion of buying votes. With low voter turnout, even in the
</I>&gt;<i> case of the proxy situation, it might sometimes only require a few paid
</I>&gt;<i> individuals to swing a vote. Aside from imposing fines for voter bribing
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe even rewards for exposing bribing attempts, what else is needed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking in the case of Scott's proxy system that if, after the
</I>&gt;<i> initial voting stage is over when users have the option to switch their
</I>&gt;<i> vote. If enough of the matched proxies switch their vote, say over 30%,
</I>&gt;<i> then the rest also switch automatically. Since that would more than likely
</I>&gt;<i> indicate that the match is not accurate for the sphere they're influencing.
</I>&gt;<i> Then have an option for the users who got switched automatically to go back
</I>&gt;<i> if they want. Maybe that's unnecessary, but a thought anyway.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;it's disappointing to seem the same tired cliches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; about why direct democracy can't work still being rehashed over and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; over.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I think this is a valuable opportunity for us, don't let this get you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Every true revolution in human history was called crazy or impossible so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; this, is really just another part of our challenge. We can sift through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; their laughable bullshit for recurrent themes and actually use this to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; advantage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, at least prepare counter-arguments and design our systems to try
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to prevent these types of failures (unlikely as they may be).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But along with that stuff about Liquid Democracy, there were also a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> couple of cites of the Swiss system being an example of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dysfunctional Direct Democracy (specifically the anti-minarets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal passing, which is often classified as an example of &quot;tyranny
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the majority&quot;). California Prop 8 (anti-gay-rights) passing was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another one I saw.  But IMHO those are bad examples for one of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same reasons misrepresentative democracy doesn't work: Proposals are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passed (or candidates elected) by only about a quarter of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> population, which effectively allows conservatives and other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authoritarians to set public policy. They're only about a quarter of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the population but have vastly higher turnout rates, distorting the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resulting decisions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not really thrilled with this paper because of the methodology
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (they basically use the experimental method itself to create a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;control condition&quot;), but I cite it anyway because it shows that at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least the &quot;correct vote&quot; part of the Swiss system seems to work, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is all I/we need:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  The more any one of us does this, the more all of us have more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> material to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; call upon. Be it simple memes that address or mock arguments, or complex
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; graphic illustrations. This is the work our species needs, don't let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; initial stupidity get you down. -it was like this for the first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scientists
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; too.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, it's a long-term kind of project. Maybe generations (though I hope
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm going to start creating more media myself, I'm trying to start with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; natural questions like the ones they're posing because that's how normal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; people's brains 'enter' the subject.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sounds good, and would be a useful resource for anyone working on new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisionmaking systems.
