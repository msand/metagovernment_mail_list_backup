<PRE>Let us assume that I will write there &quot;all the people&quot; or &quot;all citizens&quot;. Random sample of &quot;all the people&quot; is just impossible now, I do not get the attention. For citizens, it is similar in smaller scale. Still, there will be citizens that will plainly tell me that they do not care, that they did not know that the decision existed and that they do not see any way how it affects them. In that case, I dare to say that they are not stakeholders. 

Also as it is written it should be valid for decision-making in NGOs and corporations with high social responsibility. The method is not just for governments.

What do you say?



Cheers

Agreed: A controlled experiment is always better. Good luck with that ;-)

I disagree with the characterization and example: Everyone has &quot;stake&quot;

in aviation safety, as they never know when they're going to have to

fly and certainly don't want planes falling on their houses. But the

same is true of *every* public policy decision: I'm not a woman, but I

have a &quot;stake&quot; in deciding what a moral abortion policy is. I don't

have any school-age children, but have a &quot;stake&quot; in how our education

system works and on tax allocation to pay for them. All using the term

&quot;stakeholder&quot; does is allow some people to claim extra privilege.

Unfortunately, as it turns out, it's usually exactly the *wrong*

people to be deferring those decisions to because they are exactly the

people who will abuse those privileges. Allowing &quot;stakeholders&quot; to

define policy is merely an expediency because government doesn't want

to have to deal with them complaining about how they're being treated.

But as long as we can control SDAP influence and thereby ensure that

neurotypicals are making the decisions, they will by definition be

&quot;fair&quot; because it will reflect human needs and human nature and won't

be just the result of some group or personality type gaming the

system.

 Regards,

 Scott
