<PRE>&quot;I think there needs to be something on the books that protects a voter so
they can have something to fall back on and say I won't vote this way, it's
illegal. You know?&quot;

I totally resonate with that. It'd be easy too, just include it in the
terms and services agreement. You could make the penalty as serious or
flexible as you wanted. Hell I think it could even be based on their income
or net worth...

Also I think voters could deal with having votes 'set' the moment they're
cast, especially if it's not that hard work on legislation down the road.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being less corrupt, they voted to shut down the ethics office that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> investigates these breaches:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead cite the posts they found most persuasive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Disallowing vote changing doesn't by itself affect the possibility of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *both* presenting a convincing case to the early voters *and then*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to jack the proxy voters around by changing their vote and/or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their profile. For now I just plan to log and monitor changes to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> latter, but if we see signs of people changing their profiles to try
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to match some under-represented class of voters we may have to put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some restrictions on it (only allow changing it once a month or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; enough of the matched proxies switch their vote, say over 30%, then the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; also switch automatically. Since that would more than likely indicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the match is not accurate for the sphere they're influencing. Then have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; option for the users who got switched automatically to go back if they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe that's unnecessary, but a thought anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Keep 'em coming: The more of these &quot;gaming the system&quot; holes I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fill before public testing, the better...
