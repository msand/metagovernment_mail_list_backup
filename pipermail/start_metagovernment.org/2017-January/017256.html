Again, I don't think we'd even need to make this explicitly illegal,
just widely viewed as being immoral. And the leak (and trigger for
retribution) would most likely come from some *former* employee or
partner who hears that votes from individuals working for that
company/family/gang/etc. are still being corrupted by the leaders
within it. IMHO it's the vigilante aspect, especially if it turns out
to be a false claim, that we really need to worry about because actual
incidences of this kind of thing will be extremely rare (just like
voter fraud is in our current systems).

As for the solution for the coerced, it's easy: Don't cast a direct
vote. You can hardly be blamed if some random people happen to vote a
certain way and the computer guesses that you would too. If it's a
chronic problem *never* vote and just say you don't on principle: With
this system even if you never even log in after setting up your
profile you'll *still* end up with vastly better representation that
you're getting now. The only way to corrupt the operation of the
system in that case would be for the coercer to provide a complete
personality profile and require everyone to change theirs to match. I
find it hard to conceive that anyone would try to do that...

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm thinking in the case of Scott's proxy system that if, after the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> initial
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> voting stage is over when users have the option to switch their vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They don't have this option. I'm still toying with the idea with

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the batch proxy calculation), but am inclined against allowing even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that because it becomes impossible to unwind the citation chain if we

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was talking about the users that got matched to a proxy. Them changing

</I>&gt;<i> Automatically changing the rest of the matched proxies of the early voter

</I>&gt;<i> vote.
</I>
I'm not following this. The automatch vote is (currently) the average
of the 5 closest proxies. If there's one or two &quot;bad apples&quot; in there,
your calculated vote won't change and there's no need for you to cast
a direct vote or for the system to identify or take action against
those mismatches. Perhaps as an optimization or anti-fraud measure it
might be useful to go through each of the early voters and assess how
well their votes correspond to their calculated proxies: If your vote
is 1 vs 4 for your proxies on multiple proposals the odds are that
your profile is filled out wrong, either accidentally or as a
deliberate attempt to misdirect votes and you should be notified that
this has been discovered. Or maybe you're just weird and have
idiopathic justifications for every one of your votes, in which case I
guess you're just going to have to read every proposal and cast a
direct vote to get proper representation ;-)

So far, though, in my simulations I've found that it's very rare to
even get a 3/2 split and that 5-0 is by far the most common match.
There will probably more real people who have this problem because my
bots are uniformly distributed whereas humans will be a normal
(bell-curved) distribution, but this is not necessarily a problem: If
a proposal is that &quot;meh&quot; to that many people whether it passes or
fails isn't that important because in either case it will be clear
that it needs to be revised based on the feedback that will come back
to the proposer.
  Regards,
    Scott
