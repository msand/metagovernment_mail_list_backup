<PRE>Ah, guess I see it now. When it comes to theory I think I agree with both of you.
But when it comes to methodology of research, I would like to stick to stakeholder. The wikipedia definition &quot;those groups without whose support the organization would cease to exist&quot; is interesting. In the short statement I will describe it vaguely as anybody who has positive interest on good effects of a decision. Is it good?

Just for others: Shareholders = stockholders are not equivalent to stakeholders.

Cheers

 All using the term &quot;stakeholder&quot; does is allow some people  to claim extra privilege. -- Scott
Sometimes this is true. In particular:



Hunafu (Humanity + Nature + Future Generations) is affected by every land-use decision.

Hunafu is affected by every capital-allocation decision.

Hunafu is affected by every profit-taking/making decision.

Hunafu is affected by every advertising decision.

These sorts of decisions are all public matters (that affect the public).

Shareholders (and private owners more generally) are &quot;stakeholders&quot; who claim extra privilege with respect to public-matter decisions regarding their &quot;private&quot; property.

It is unclear why the rest of us should continue to grant those extra privileges.
