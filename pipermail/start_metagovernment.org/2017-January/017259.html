Well, it'd still require at least a few hundred people to cast votes
in each locality (assuming random sampling: It won't work if the SDAPs
arrange it so somehow only they get to vote at all). But part of the
plan is a formal way to transfer control from one Locality to another
(or to the Globality) in the case of some sort of breakdown (natural
disaster, civil war, coup attempt, etc.). For example if government in
my locality were somehow compromised I'd be thrilled to be able to
vote transfer total control to the citizens of Oslo (or whereever).
Heck, I'm kind of thinking that requesting a reality check like that
should be an option for *any* highly controversial Locality
proposal...

&gt;<i> I'd like to hear your process on
</I>&gt;<i> that and what the algorithm's based on. I'm also curious if you see that as
</I>&gt;<i> a potential open source technology.
</I>
It'll all of course be open source, and based entirely on other open
source technology. And with open data anyone who's interested (and has
the technical chops) could trace the complete path of a vote from
button click to the log file on the server. The design at this point
is still pretty close to that I've posted to the list previously
(search the archives for &quot;AutoMatch&quot;):
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/</A>

&gt;<i> &quot;even if you never even log in after setting up your
</I>&gt;<i> profile you'll *still* end up with vastly better representation that
</I>&gt;<i> you're getting now.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think with the right set up DD can help change creep in as long as it's
</I>&gt;<i> proving effective elsewhere. Earlier today I heard from someone who thought
</I>&gt;<i> we expected everyone to just hop on board from day one, like that was
</I>&gt;<i> necessary or even possible. It starts with a really solid design that
</I>&gt;<i> succeeds in creating communities that thrive and expand.
</I>
I'm actually more worried about it being adopted too quickly than too
slowly. These kinds of things have a tendency to reach a tipping point
relatively quickly after which all hell breaks lose if the new system
isn't fully developed (e.g. all the communist revolutions had this
characteristic, and even the American and French revolutions were a
lot messier than they needed to be). Twitter and Facebook both grew to
10 million users in about 2 years, Google+ did that in *two weeks*.
There's a running joke on Slashdot about being &quot;slashdotted&quot;, which is
where a post about a new product or service appearing there causes an
instant crash of the servers it is running on because so many people
try to sign up all at once...

&gt;<i> Plus before full scale implementation DD can be used to create global
</I>&gt;<i> accords, so if some community of shitheads tries making slavery or something
</I>&gt;<i> else that violates the global accords, we can sanction, boycott and all
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of other things to make that option too expensive for them. Especially
</I>&gt;<i> if instead of fighting to get them ruled by our choice of rulers we're
</I>&gt;<i> simply saying basic, highly defensible things like 'no slavery'. If people
</I>&gt;<i> try making global pacts that are too nitpicky it'll be easy for others to
</I>&gt;<i> argue we should respect localities sovereignty and that global pacts are for
</I>&gt;<i> basic human rights.
</I>
One of the early proposals in my queue (which is up to over 100 items
now) is a &quot;fundamental human right to secession&quot; where any Locality
has the right to quit their county/state/country and either form their
own national government, or join some existing top-level organization
(i.e., what are we going to do about Taiwan, Crimea, Palestine, etc.).
Parallel to that should be a right for the Globality to just cut off
any Locality that fails to meet the basic standards established by The
People, at which point a whole range of more aggressive tactics would
come into play (e.g. something like a &quot;People's Fatwa&quot; against an
illegitimate government).

&gt;<i> I think we need to start making better infographics. We're reaching the
</I>&gt;<i> Galileo stage of this movement where we know the answers to our critics
</I>&gt;<i> better than they do. If we all start making solid explanatory media then we
</I>&gt;<i> can start hitting the culture wars hard. Like a movement truly for and by
</I>&gt;<i> the people should be!
</I>
For my purposes something explaining &quot;moral progressivism&quot; would be a
very useful thing to have:
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/internal-moral-codes/">http://www.matchism.org/internal-moral-codes/</A>

A grasp of that would help people accept that &quot;right to secession&quot;
thing, and indeed the idea that the only legitimate government is one
that can *prove* that the majority of the population supports it...
  Regards,
    Scott
