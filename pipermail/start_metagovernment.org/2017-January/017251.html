<PRE>One thing that I gleaned from this discussion that I perhaps glossed over
before, is the notion of buying votes. With low voter turnout, even in the
case of the proxy situation, it might sometimes only require a few paid
individuals to swing a vote. Aside from imposing fines for voter bribing
and maybe even rewards for exposing bribing attempts, what else is needed?

I'm thinking in the case of Scott's proxy system that if, after the initial
voting stage is over when users have the option to switch their vote. If
enough of the matched proxies switch their vote, say over 30%, then the
rest also switch automatically. Since that would more than likely indicate
that the match is not accurate for the sphere they're influencing. Then
have an option for the users who got switched automatically to go back if
they want. Maybe that's unnecessary, but a thought anyway.

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> dysfunctional Direct Democracy (specifically the anti-minarets
</I>&gt;<i> proposal passing, which is often classified as an example of &quot;tyranny

</I>&gt;<i> another one I saw.  But IMHO those are bad examples for one of the

</I>&gt;<i> authoritarians to set public policy. They're only about a quarter of
</I>&gt;<i> the population but have vastly higher turnout rates, distorting the
</I>&gt;<i> resulting decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not really thrilled with this paper because of the methodology
</I>&gt;<i> (they basically use the experimental method itself to create a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;control condition&quot;), but I cite it anyway because it shows that at
</I>&gt;<i> least the &quot;correct vote&quot; part of the Swiss system seems to work, which
</I>&gt;<i> is all I/we need:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  The more any one of us does this, the more all of us have more material
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; call upon. Be it simple memes that address or mock arguments, or complex

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; initial stupidity get you down. -it was like this for the first

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, it's a long-term kind of project. Maybe generations (though I hope
