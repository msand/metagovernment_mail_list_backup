</I>
I don't even think either of those is even required: It's one's civic
duty to report any bribe attempt like this and I would expect pretty
fearsome retribution to befall anyone who tried. IMHO this doesn't
even need to be a part of the system itself because other social media
would take care of it (after seeing that, my prediction is that people
wouldn't even bother to read the proposal, they'd just cast a direct
vote to punish the offender). I'm actually more worried about *false*
reports than actual bribery or fraud, just as I worry more about false
information (and demagoguery) in the &quot;justifications&quot; posts than
people being paid to write eruditely on a particular side.

Speaking of which, I'm just *loving* the implosion of the Republican
party, living fully up to the worst of authoritarian behavior as
Altemeyer found in his Global Change Game experiment (i.e., high RWA
individuals are vastly more likely to steal from the public trough and
commit a wide range of other unethical acts). So many Republicans been
caught doing this that they now feel &quot;targeted&quot;. But rather than just
being less corrupt, they voted to shut down the ethics office that
investigates these breaches:

Between them and Trump, it seems to me that there has been no better
time in decades to launch a new decisionmaking system...

&gt;<i> I'm thinking in the case of Scott's proxy system that if, after the initial
</I>&gt;<i> voting stage is over when users have the option to switch their vote.
</I>
They don't have this option. I'm still toying with the idea with
allowing early voters to change their vote at all (even long before
the batch proxy calculation), but am inclined against allowing even
that because it becomes impossible to unwind the citation chain if we
do. We'll have to see how that goes, but my expectation is that very
few early voters will even post and that the majority of them will
instead cite the posts they found most persuasive.

Disallowing vote changing doesn't by itself affect the possibility of
bribes, but would prevent anyone from trying to game the system by
*both* presenting a convincing case to the early voters *and then*
trying to jack the proxy voters around by changing their vote and/or
their profile. For now I just plan to log and monitor changes to the
latter, but if we see signs of people changing their profiles to try
to match some under-represented class of voters we may have to put
some restrictions on it (only allow changing it once a month or
something).

&gt;<i> If
</I>&gt;<i> enough of the matched proxies switch their vote, say over 30%, then the rest
</I>&gt;<i> also switch automatically. Since that would more than likely indicate that
</I>&gt;<i> the match is not accurate for the sphere they're influencing. Then have an
</I>&gt;<i> option for the users who got switched automatically to go back if they want.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe that's unnecessary, but a thought anyway.
</I>
Keep 'em coming: The more of these &quot;gaming the system&quot; holes I can
fill before public testing, the better...
  Regards,
    Scott
