Alright but if you had a boss (partner) that told you to vote a certain way
for the good of the company (family) and they could look up to see if you
did in fact, vote that way. What would the retribution be? The company
won't be punished for pushing their own agenda, as little influence as it
might have. I think there needs to be something on the books that protects
a voter so they can have something to fall back on and say I won't vote
this way, it's illegal. You know?

I was talking about the users that got matched to a proxy. Them changing
their assigned vote after the initial vote of the early voters. I assumed
the early voters wouldn't be able to change their vote once they cast it.
Automatically changing the rest of the matched proxies of the early voter
when a significant percentage of the matched proxies switched their
assigned vote.

</I>&gt;<i> commit a wide range of other unethical acts). So many Republicans been
</I>&gt;<i> caught doing this that they now feel &quot;targeted&quot;. But rather than just
</I>&gt;<i> being less corrupt, they voted to shut down the ethics office that
</I>&gt;<i> investigates these breaches:

</I>&gt;<i> Between them and Trump, it seems to me that there has been no better

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Disallowing vote changing doesn't by itself affect the possibility of

</I>&gt;<i> *both* presenting a convincing case to the early voters *and then*
</I>&gt;<i> trying to jack the proxy voters around by changing their vote and/or
</I>&gt;<i> their profile. For now I just plan to log and monitor changes to the
</I>&gt;<i> latter, but if we see signs of people changing their profiles to try
</I>&gt;<i> to match some under-represented class of voters we may have to put
</I>&gt;<i> some restrictions on it (only allow changing it once a month or
</I>&gt;<i> something).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough of the matched proxies switch their vote, say over 30%, then the
</I>&gt;<i> rest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also switch automatically. Since that would more than likely indicate
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the match is not accurate for the sphere they're influencing. Then have
</I>&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; option for the users who got switched automatically to go back if they
</I>&gt;<i> want.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe that's unnecessary, but a thought anyway.
