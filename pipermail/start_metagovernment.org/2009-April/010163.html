<PRE>I'm not sure we can ever eliminate subjectivity entirely.  Indeed, for
entertainment purposes it is highly relevant.  However, I strongly agree
with Gustavo that, to the greatest degree possible, subjectivity should be
eliminated from political governance, i.e., any system under which people
may be coerced into doing anything they would not otherwise be inclined to
do of their own volition.  (Perhaps the greatest risk in political
governance systems is subjectivity in the form of groupthink and the
creation of in-groups versus out-groups.)

 

To the degree that we must continue to rely upon elected officials to do our
bidding, it is not the candidates themselves that should be &quot;scored&quot; but,
rather, the goals and objectives they have documented (preferably in StratML
format).  The values (principles) they espouse are also highly relevant but
what truly matters is what they plan to *do* (i.e., their goals and
objectives), what inputs (resources) are required, and how they plan to
obtain those inputs, together with the actual, documented results they have
achieved and the inputs they have consumed in doing so.  We should not allow
ourselves to continue to be forced into &quot;voting&quot; for the candidate who is
the least unrepresentative of our views on *all* of the issues that are
important to us.

 

It is noteworthy that the term &quot;subjectivity&quot; has two meanings that are
highly relevant in this context: 1) the implication is that decisions are
made based upon something other than reliable, trustworthy evidence, and 2)
that is it necessary for us to &quot;subject&quot; ourselves to the will of others
whom we have empowered to &quot;govern&quot; our actions.  Neither of those meanings
should be accepted without clear justification.

 

As previously stated, I am not at all interested in supporting any system
that amounts to a cult of personality, even if it is based upon
&quot;reputation&quot;.  What I am interested in is systems that are focused on
achieving measurable results based upon reliable, trustworthy records of
reality.

As I said before, I simply do not like the idea of subjective score systems,
particularly those socially-oriented. There are political issues there which
promote some of the bad habits of representative democracy systems. 

 

You do not create a sense of community, but really do the opposite:
stimulate personal or small group gains. For instance, in this scenario we
could have the same political parties and lobbists we observe today, still
conducting the same practices for personal or small group gains, because
these parties could inflate their scores just by voting in one another. 

 

With subjective score systems marketing would have a disproportional
importance on the political arena, as the way people see each other would
mean way more than the way people really are (or vote). This is particularly
important in big communities where you don't get to see someone
face-to-face, but through a very distorted media channel. For instance,
Britney Spears, with all its media hype (at least in her glory days...),
would have a vote on nuclear proliferation control which would count more
than some pre-nobel nuclear scientist entrenched in his lab. I can even see
the media seizing control of the community, as they usually control most of
the general public opinion 

 

There are hundreds of bad reasons for not riding the road of subjective
scoring. I would really want to know the opinion of others on this matter.

Interestingly, that site links to one that Christopher Ritter had posted to

The book is very good at presenting the paradigm, but doesn't go into much
detail... that will have to be up to us. :)

As for the value of points, I think they would have to be community-defined.
That is, each community sets its own point-value system (and perhaps also
determines a base score or an accumulation value for new members). That way,
communities can define exchange rates between each other. The book only
describes Whuffie as a seemingly universal standard; but I think it would
have to have a community-specific element.

After all, you wouldn't necessarily want someone with a fantastically-high
score derived from the Britney Spears fan club community to therefore have a
great deal of power in the nuclear proliferation control community.

As for what initial score to hand out... I think it would be more likely to
start at zero and to gradually accumulate based on participation.


Yes but where does it come from? There has to be a source from which
it can be accumulated. If you allow each user to generate the currency
through scoring, you have the onset of inflation only bounded by the
largest number you can represent with a computer(unbounded for all
practical purposes). If you hand out a fixed amount per person you
have a situation where you must verify their identity, to prevent a
group from creating multiple accounts and thereby gaining
proportionally more of the currency.

A possible solution is paying for services to the community with the
currency. The community needs somebody to do some research on a topic,
make a proposal summarize a debate (whatever may be of value to them).
Collectively they agree to pay a certain amount. Once the system is
running you can adjust inflation with intrest/deprication rates based
on the total amount in circulation.

Since fiat currencies have a bad history though, it would be good to
be able to guarantee something for peoples money, so that it's a bit
more tangible. Otherwise you have to ask what is the currency worth? I
guess I should read on before I continue.
