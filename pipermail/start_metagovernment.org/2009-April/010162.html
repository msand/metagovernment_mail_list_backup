<PRE>As I said before, I simply do not like the idea of subjective score systems,
particularly those socially-oriented. There are political issues there which
promote some of the bad habits of representative democracy systems.

You do not create a sense of community, but really do the opposite:
stimulate personal or small group gains. For instance, in this scenario we
could have the same political parties and lobbists we observe today, still
conducting the same practices for personal or small group gains, because
these parties could inflate their scores just by voting in one another.

With subjective score systems marketing would have a disproportional
importance on the political arena, as the way people see each other would
mean way more than the way people really are (or vote). This is particularly
important in big communities where you don't get to see someone
face-to-face, but through a very distorted media channel. For instance,
Britney Spears, with all its media hype (at least in her glory days...),
would have a vote on nuclear proliferation control which would count more
than some pre-nobel nuclear scientist entrenched in his lab. I can even see
the media seizing control of the community, as they usually control most of
the general public opinion

There are hundreds of bad reasons for not riding the road of subjective
scoring. I would really want to know the opinion of others on this matter.
