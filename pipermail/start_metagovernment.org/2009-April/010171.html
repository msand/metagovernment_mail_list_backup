<PRE>In OpenStrategies Ltd we've spent hundreds of hours addressing
prioritisation.  There are many complications eg the relative size of each
stakeholder, the representativeness of stakeholders, the ability of
different stakeholders to contribute to the implementation of projects, the
varying extents to which different stakeholders benefit from (or are
disadvantaged by) different projects, the widely varying levels of interest
different stakeholders have in different issues and so on.

We've decided that no algorithm will ever be invented that will enable
effective multi-stakeholder prioritisation (in our experience the first
reaction to the introduction of any prioritisation system ... is heated
argument about the logic of the prioritisation system....)

Instead we use what we call a &quot;rating system&quot; - which so far appears to be
quite readily accepted by multi-stakeholder groups.  

Stakeholders give each Project, Result, Use or Benefit (in an OpenStrategy)
a rating of +5 to -5.  Broadly, +5 means it's important to them and they
support it, -5 means they are opposed to it, 0 means they aren't interested
in it.  These meanings of +5....-5 actually need not be too specific - they
can mean different things to different people and still function OK.

This process effectively clusters the &quot;for&quot;, &quot;against&quot; and &quot;not interested&quot;
stakeholders in a transparent manner (there are risks in doing this).  This
then enables whoever submitted an idea for a project etc to approach the
&quot;not interested&quot; and &quot;against&quot; stakeholders to discuss whether the project
etc can be modified so as to win their support.  Relatively minor changes
can sometimes make a project much more attractive to opponents, achieving a
win-win situation.  

Clearly this often won't be the case - our rating system sometimes
demonstrates that a community is very polarised about an issue (lots of +4s
and +5s and -4s and -5s).  In such situations a facilitated process is then
necessary to try to reduce the polarisation, followed by mediation and
ultimately some sort of democratic voting process (with all its inherent
&quot;majority rules&quot; problems&quot;) to make a final decision.

So rather than just prioritising &quot;projects/ideas that are already on the
table&quot;, our rating system stimulates the modification of projects/ideas in
order to gain more widespread support for specific ideas so that, hopefully,
there is less need for prioritisation (because in this process, stakeholders
often discover that between them they have enough in-house resources to go
ahead with the project anyway).  

So while our rating system isn't a universal prioritisation panacea, it does
appear to take the sting out of many issues that have the potential to be
successfully modified to bring dissenters on board.

Jim, without knowing how White House 2 is architected, it sounds like it may
conflict with the principle of separation of concerns:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns</A> 

 

Also, to the degree that objectives may be tied up in software programming
logic, they are &quot;proprietary&quot; in nature.  The records that are created in
the process should be in an open data format, of which XML is the
international voluntary consensus standard of choice, and thus available for
use by any XML-enabled application stakeholders may choose to use.

 

Have you specified an XML schema for the data you are collecting?  If so, is
it in the public domain and are you seeking to have it established as an
international voluntary consensus standard?  Are any other software or
service providers planning to leverage White House 2 data? 

 

BTW, in the StratML Committee, the concept of priority has not come up yet,
although I suspect we may want to address it at some point.  For now,
however, either an organization plans to accomplish an objective or it would
not be included in its strategic plan.  However, since organizations should
consult with their stakeholders in formulating their plans, it would be fair
to say that stakeholders should be engaged in helping to determine which
objectives are to be pursued and, by implication, which will not -- due to
resource constraints.  In that sense, your suggestion that &quot;objectives&quot;
could be called &quot;priorities&quot; is not incorrect, but having too many
&quot;priorities&quot; is commonly a bigger problem than having too few - particularly
to the degree that resource constraints are not appropriately considered.
Does White House 2 have a well-structured way of fostering the
identification and allocation of inputs (resources) required to achieve
objectives (i.e., to make them real priorities rather than merely rhetorical
priorities)?

FWIW, I kind of like how it's structured in White House 2, although I'm a
little biased.  There the two concepts are basically merged.   Instead of a
separate &quot;debate&quot;, you specify the pros and cons of a given priority or
&quot;objective&quot; to use the StratML language.   So, I support this priority, I
think we should do it, it's my priority #3, and here's why.

If we have the will to do so, WE could specify an XML schema comprising the

around such a standard.

 

However, I personally am not nearly so interested in &quot;debate&quot; per se as I am
in expressions of intended actions (i.e., goals and objectives).  Talk is
cheap.  Action takes somewhat more effort.  It is also more productive and,
thus, worth taking the time and effort to provide feedback when it may
affect us as stakeholders.

Yeah, I was rather surprised. I haven't had time to review the sites, but am
looking forward to that panel.

 

Pietro or Manuel (or others) do you have any specific questions you would
like me to direct to them? Pietro, I noticed on the FP7 proposal, you
suggest a dynamic hyperbolic graph. Might one of these be preferable?

On collaboration systems, <A HREF="http://www.pligg.com/">http://www.pligg.com/</A> seems interesting. Sort of a

I also found <A HREF="http://opendialogcoalition.com/web/">http://opendialogcoalition.com/web/</A> interesting and think that
they need to talk to both Owen and Pietro about efforts for data
normalization and open architectures for sharing between communities.

I think there was more, but I am under-slept and need to rest up for POLC
tomorrow. I'll try to write about that, but am leaving the next day on a
business trip so may be on limited involvement for another week.

Owen-
You emailed me a couple months ago about StratML, and I implemented it
within a couple of hours, as best I could to meet the standard based on the
way the data is structured.  <A HREF="http://whitehouse2.org/export/stratml.xml">http://whitehouse2.org/export/stratml.xml</A>

The data is also available in an XML REST API in a format useful for other
web applications. (you can pretty much just add &quot;.xml&quot; to the end of any URL
and get at it that way, if you just want to poke around).  The API is not
documented yet, but will be at some point.

The whole point of priorities in the White House 2 system is to figure out
what to do first.  Everything is in a list, forcing people to choose which
is first and which is second, etc.  That's why they are called priorities,
and not objectives.
