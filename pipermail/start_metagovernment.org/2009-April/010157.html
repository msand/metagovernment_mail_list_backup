<PRE>Hi Ed and everybody else,

Sorry for being away for such a long time. I had my baby's (somewhat
complicated) birth last month and he's now taking 95% of my (already
reduced) free time.
As Pietro stated in a previous email we cannot tell much more about the
proposal until we have the final EU evaluation results.
But no matter what the result is, we have informally committed on
working out the project's idea after the evaluation.

Pietro, I think your explanation below will become crystal clear to
others when we can show up the system architecture (I think around
mid-july the results will be published).

What I can say now is that you can continue to work on metagovernment's
prototypes (there's no conflict of interest here) and (specially if the
project is accepted) we will work out a way to integrate it (perhaps
some of you can directly collaborate with us if you wish).

cheers, crossed fingers,
giovani
