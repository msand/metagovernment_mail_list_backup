Dear Ed,
dear list,

yes, in vague terms I can. In more precise terms not yet.

The FP7 proposal was sent, and it was good. I am very pleased by the
resulting document.
We are now a series of 6 partners, of which 5 scientific. Coimbra is
mainly involved in developing the new knowledge, given the past
knowledge. Essentially what we all have been interested. In doing this
we will have enough money to employ at least 2 PhD students, and maybe
more.

Part of our work will be done in investigating and employing the full
power of the tags.
Another part in describing how given n people who are proposing
solutions on a topic we can integrate them in a coherent whole. We
proposed two different solutions, on the spot, but we also said we
will investigate for any other solution that might work.
(A personal thanks to Mathias who sent me a book reference on voting.
That book is great, I think you should share it with the whole group.
Not only I referenced it in the proposal, but I learned a great deal
from it. Thanks again.)

I see one of the PhD student will mainly work on the tags, and the
other on synthesizing group knowledge.

I expect that in Coimbra, we will all work generally as a team, with
everybody feeding each other with ideas. One other partner is
specifically employed to program all this stuff at a professional
level. Which mean that although we are all going to program, we will
also have a lot of help from outside. So we can focus on the research
behind it. The prior work, the possible solutions. In short make a dam
good work!

I just received some preliminary data, and we are competing with other
50 projects for about 10 positions. So one project on 5 will get
funded. I think we have reasonable chances, as I see our project as
really good. But then I have been told that NO ONE gets more than 30%
(or less that 10%) of probability in this game. It is a lot a matter
of luck, and often is the wrong project that gets funded.

Note that among the elements of the project we are also suggesting to
fund a conference each year in Europe on the topic. This will not only
promote the project but bring on the awareness on the topic. I think
if our project gets funded, this might be one of the greatest reasons
of interests for our list.

Please forgive me if I cannot enter more in the detail. There is a lot
more, and it is all really cool. Of course all the members of this
list can apply for a PhD position, although I will need to take the
best that appears to me, without making any favoritism toward anybody.

Manuel, FYI, another partner is another German University, so you
might want to apply there if you don't fancy applying for the the
warmth, and sun of Portugal, or someone with a stronger CV appears.
But the synthesizing group knowledge stuff, and the tags, are only
happening here.

Also all the code that is being produced will be released, although I
don't think this will be done as it is produced, but as it is common
in academic it will be released at the end (or halfway).

Now we have a big jigsaw of competing interests that need to be put
together to go forward. If I sent you any info on this stuff, please
wait to use it until it has been released (more about it later). We
want to get something out as soon as possible, and we want to get a
paper out as soon as possible too. This to permit to everybody to join
in in the global think tank. And this can only be done when the first
paper is out to avoid late discussions (if you have worked in academia
you know what I am referring to).

But the paper in turn need to wait until the EU has evaluated our project.
Also the paper will need some simple test cases.

SO what I think will happen is that
a) we shall write a small prototype of a few ideas, and go forward
with that. I am so excited about this stuff that I cannot sit still
unless I know some work is progressing.
b)  the prototype will enter an extensive alpha stage that will enter
when the paper is out, and the EU has evaluated the project (with ANY
result).

While the project is in alpha stage some people of this list will be
allowed to play with it. But not the general public, or people we
don't know. This because the EU project evaluation is tied to this
work, and we don't want to screw that up, right?

I should also mention that you should all greatly thank Giovani for
the work done. Not only he started this whole FP7 project, he also
worked for it until the last day, making often the nights ( I would
receive emails in the morning), and he really worked hard in
accommodating and smoothing out some hardness we had inside the group
due to real big cultural differences. Without him the proposal would
not only have started, but also once started not have reached this
level. Even if the proposal will not be approved, the ideas we
developed and clarified in the proposal will keep on going forward
(although at a slower rate). And this by itself is a great success.

Manuel, Mathias, and Ed, I know I sent you some info about a few of
the ideas we were working on. Please keep those info for yourself, and
wait before applying them (even in your personal project). It is
fairly important that it all appears (as it actually was) that those
ideas were generated from the FP7 team. If someone finds some of those
ideas released out in the open, he might think that the ideas were not
original, and then the whole project is at risk. Plus it would be
quite unfair toward those who came out with them.

I am right now in England, in the same town of one of the EU partners,
and we have already started some preliminary work, and test cases on
the prototype. Stay tuned.

Best Regards,
Pietro
