<PRE>My best guess is Metagovernment will follow a bottom-up direction, but will
face more and more difficuties as it tries to deal with more complex
communities. For instance, I think it can govern a residence condo quite
well, managing even the operative staff. When you go up to small
communities, like neighborhoods/small countys, probably Metagovernment can
take care of it on its own too.

However, when you go up to cities and more complex social structures I think
an administrative staff will be absolutely needed. As a matter of fact, I
once thought of different government setting of direct democracy, mostly
based on Athenian Democracy. That government would have executive and
judiciary powers, but the legislative would be extinct. In its place there
would be a Metagovernment like structure with powers such as:
-sanction or veto, totally or partially, Legislative issues;
-sanction or veto, totally or partially, executive and budget plans proposed
by the Excutive Power;
-sanction or veto, totally or partially, some executive decrees (such as
military issues and wages of public workers);
-elect and fire the highest authorities of other Powers (such as president,
prime-minister, ministers, or other entities the new government might use)
-judge political crimes done by the highest authorities of other Powers;
and,
-vote on any other matter relative to the State, exceptionally proposed
through population initiative, with a higher authority than any other Power.
Therefore this &quot;Peoples Council&quot; would be the sovereign ruler, changing
administrative staff decrees whenever the population sees fit, albeit
leaving some degree of freedom for the other Powers.

So, in my opinion, an administrative staff is needed and Metagovernment can
only replace the entire government structure in a quite distant future,
one where people actually have a lot of spare time to do it. Then again,
there are always the ideals of Bertrand Russel and Domenico de Masi on
Creative Idleness...

</I>&gt;<i> a) The members through &quot;Meta administration&quot;. They are remunerated as in an

</I>&gt;<i> b) The organization hires an administrative staff. They are somewhat
