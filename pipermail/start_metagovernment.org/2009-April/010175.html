<PRE>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://debategraph.org/">http://debategraph.org/</A> however is indeed a sophisticated visualization
</I>&gt;<i> tool. As is I planned on talking with David Price, who was presenting it,
</I>&gt;<i> but was not able to coordinate schedules (my presentation was right after
</I>&gt;<i> his, and I had to leave early to prepare). However, Pietro and/or Manuel, I
</I>&gt;<i> think you may want to talk to him about leveraging his tool toward
</I>&gt;<i> Metascore. (Or Pietro, do you already have a visualizer involved in the FP7
</I>&gt;<i> proposal?)
</I>
Well, actually we do.
Since the discussion will take place in time, with new opinion being
presented later, and displacing previous one, we are thinking of
presenting them as a taxonomic tree. Now taxonomic tree have their own
XML language, and their own well devloped visualization tools, so even
though we did not investigate the topic directly for now, we know we
are going to be covered.

Then there is the topic of tags, and we will need non historical
visualization tools. There a graph might be a better tool. In any case
once the theorethical structure that we are working with is clear,
then we shall find the right tool for it. Not the other way round. The
structure need only to be the precise one to represent the data. The
the movement from structure to visualization will be a different
problem.

&gt;<i> I have been conversing with him by e-mail, but I am not the right person to
</I>&gt;<i> carry the conversation forward, so... if one of you would like, I'll
</I>&gt;<i> e-introduce you.
</I>
Thanks, maybe later.


Cheers,
Pietro
