<PRE>If we have the will to do so, WE could specify an XML schema comprising the
elements of &quot;debate&quot; as a proposed open, voluntary consensus standard and
challenge those who purport to want to provide such services to coalesce
around such a standard.

 

However, I personally am not nearly so interested in &quot;debate&quot; per se as I am
in expressions of intended actions (i.e., goals and objectives).  Talk is
cheap.  Action takes somewhat more effort.  It is also more productive and,
thus, worth taking the time and effort to provide feedback when it may
affect us as stakeholders.

Yeah, I was rather surprised. I haven't had time to review the sites, but am
looking forward to that panel.

 

Pietro or Manuel (or others) do you have any specific questions you would
like me to direct to them? Pietro, I noticed on the FP7 proposal, you
suggest a dynamic hyperbolic graph. Might one of these be preferable?

Holy moley, I had no idea there were so many debate sites!   The open
congress wiki lists 7 different sites.  Two of them actually have a decent
amount of traction (100k visitors a month) <A HREF="http://procon.org">http://procon.org</A> and

I am a little frazzled today and don't have much time, but I can at least
share a few links I took away from eDemocracyCamp (most of which I tweeted
earlier).

This group has talked a lot about how to visualize debates, for example:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:PrototypeA#Comments_structure">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:PrototypeA#Comments_structure</A>
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/FP7#Tags">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/FP7#Tags</A>
and I saw brief demos of a couple of nice systems:
<A HREF="http://debategraph.org/">http://debategraph.org/</A>
<A HREF="http://deepdebate.org/debates/221">http://deepdebate.org/debates/221</A>
I hope that tomorrow I will be able to get to this session at the POLC:
<A HREF="http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/The_Future_of_Public_Debate_Online">http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/The_Future_of_Public_Debate_Online</A>
where I will see several more. Look at the great links on the above page,
under &quot;Speakers.&quot;

On collaboration systems, <A HREF="http://www.pligg.com/">http://www.pligg.com/</A> seems interesting. Sort of a
CMS with an internal Digg-like system. It is open source, uses a 5-star
scoring system, and... well, have a look. Somewhat similarly,
<A HREF="http://www.mixedink.com/">http://www.mixedink.com/</A> is a mass-collaboration writing system.

I also found <A HREF="http://opendialogcoalition.com/web/">http://opendialogcoalition.com/web/</A> interesting and think that
they need to talk to both Owen and Pietro about efforts for data
normalization and open architectures for sharing between communities.

I think there was more, but I am under-slept and need to rest up for POLC
tomorrow. I'll try to write about that, but am leaving the next day on a
business trip so may be on limited involvement for another week.
