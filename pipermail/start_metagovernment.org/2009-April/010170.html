<PRE>Owen-
You emailed me a couple months ago about StratML, and I implemented it
within a couple of hours, as best I could to meet the standard based on the
way the data is structured.  <A HREF="http://whitehouse2.org/export/stratml.xml">http://whitehouse2.org/export/stratml.xml</A>

The data is also available in an XML REST API in a format useful for other
web applications. (you can pretty much just add &quot;.xml&quot; to the end of any URL
and get at it that way, if you just want to poke around).  The API is not
documented yet, but will be at some point.

The whole point of priorities in the White House 2 system is to figure out
what to do first.  Everything is in a list, forcing people to choose which
is first and which is second, etc.  That's why they are called priorities,
and not objectives.

</I>&gt;<i> resource constraints.  In that sense, your suggestion that &#8220;objectives&#8221;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, I kind of like how it's structured in White House 2, although I'm a
</I>&gt;<i> little biased.  There the two concepts are basically merged.   Instead of a
</I>&gt;<i> separate &quot;debate&quot;, you specify the pros and cons of a given priority or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;objective&quot; to use the StratML language.   So, I support this priority, I
</I>&gt;<i> think we should do it, it's my priority #3, and here's why.

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://deepdebate.org/debates/221">http://deepdebate.org/debates/221</A>

</I>&gt;<i> where I will see several more. Look at the great links on the above page,
</I>&gt;<i> under &quot;Speakers.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On collaboration systems, <A HREF="http://www.pligg.com/">http://www.pligg.com/</A> seems interesting. Sort of
</I>&gt;<i> a CMS with an internal Digg-like system. It is open source, uses a 5-star
</I>&gt;<i> scoring system, and... well, have a look. Somewhat similarly,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mixedink.com/">http://www.mixedink.com/</A> is a mass-collaboration writing system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also found <A HREF="http://opendialogcoalition.com/web/">http://opendialogcoalition.com/web/</A> interesting and think
</I>&gt;<i> that they need to talk to both Owen and Pietro about efforts for data
</I>&gt;<i> normalization and open architectures for sharing between communities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there was more, but I am under-slept and need to rest up for POLC
</I>&gt;<i> tomorrow. I'll try to write about that, but am leaving the next day on a
</I>&gt;<i> business trip so may be on limited involvement for another week.
