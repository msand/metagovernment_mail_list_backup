<PRE>Hi Ed,
I would say that for now Giovani's idea to build the separate
components first, and then put them together is probably more
appropriate. Somehow each brick is going through its own personal
evolution, to do its work perfectly. Then we might find that different
situation (i.e. size of the group, percentage of people participating,
etc...) might call for different instruments.

The idea of a single instrument that work on every scale might not be
possible. And this limit might not depend on computer power but on
human power. Imagine a solution that requires every participant to
read every solution of the other. It might works wonders for small
groups, but be unusable for groups of more than 100 people. But this
would not mean that we cannot split a complex problems into a series
of simpler and solvable ones. Only that now we are using wo
instruments, the one that you use to solve a single problem, and the
algorithm that splits up the complex one into smaller components. You
see what I mean when I speak of different components?

So I would say we will have more than one prototype, and we might even
have the same idea being implemented with slight variation here and
there, with the effect of seeing how robust the results are. It's all
food, at the end ;)


Cheers,
Pietro
