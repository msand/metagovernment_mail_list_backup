<PRE>Chris, I have exchanged E-mail with Kevin about the workshop but not with
respect to Metagov.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend OASIS's eGov
workshop because we're at our winter home in Hilton Head.  If this is you
<A HREF="http://www.linkedin.com/in/chriscargile,">http://www.linkedin.com/in/chriscargile,</A> we have South Carolina in common,
in addition to an interest in Metagov and eGov more generally.

 

I am linking to the workshop site at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/index.asp#April">http://xml.gov/index.asp#April</A> and now
see they have added the capability to participate via Webinar:
<A HREF="http://events.oasis-open.org/home/egov-dc-workshop/2009">http://events.oasis-open.org/home/egov-dc-workshop/2009</A> 

 

The agenda looks pretty  full and not necessarily aimed at topics like
Metagov: <A HREF="http://events.oasis-open.org/home/egov-dc-workshop/2009/agenda">http://events.oasis-open.org/home/egov-dc-workshop/2009/agenda</A>
However, if things aren't too crazy here on Friday, I may try to listen in
on parts of the workshop.

 

BTW, I am trying to engage The World Bank in fostering the usage of the
emerging StratML standard in developing countries.  That was the focus of my
exchange with Kevin.

Hi Owen,

I was going to mention to the group today that maybe someone should go to
the eGov Workshop (free) in DC on Friday 17 to represent metagovernment.
Then I noticed that you are a part of the eGov Interest Group of which Kevin
Novak is a part of and is a speaker (ctrl+f  &quot;novak&quot;)
<A HREF="http://events.oasis-open.org/home/egov-dc-workshop/2009/speakerprofiles">http://events.oasis-open.org/home/egov-dc-workshop/2009/speakerprofiles</A>   

Can you tell us more about whether this would be a venue to promote
metagovernment to the effect that Ed mentioned or where is the best place to
gain grassroots momentum?  Will the people at these types of events listen
to run-of-the-mill concerned citizens?

Please visit oasis-open to register for the conference or learn more here -&gt;

Hi,
I came across your project some time ago, glad to see that it is
progressing nicely.

I have a suggestion, I think that you should have a list of supporters,
so that the general public can get involved &amp; we can then create a
ground swell of support out in the real world.

We need to convince people in the real world that this is a viable
alternative, we need the general public involved, we are never going to
get the support for this idea if we do not, we NEED a sign &amp; SUPPORT us
page, we NEED a LINK to us page, we NEED more public awareness, I have
mentioned metagovernance to some friend of mine &amp; all I get are puzzled
looks, I try to explain &amp; I can see their eyes glaze over.

We need more awareness, a facebook page, press releases, adverts on
radio, if this take money, lets get fund raising. Our Country &amp; the
World need a new solution to all of the problems we face the old style
government does not have ANY of the answers, the old style govt, is part
of the problem.

C'mon people, do we believe in this or what!

I shall look forward to your reply in due course.

Regards,


Ed Blundell,

PS: I have signed up as a participant as well.

Message-ID: &lt;002b01c9b7fb$120dac10$36290430$@<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">Ambur at verizon.net</A>&gt;
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;

Ed's reference to &quot;ground swell&quot; prompts me to:



1)      Forward a link to the StratML document in which the essence of the
book by that name is distilled -- <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/Groundswell.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/Groundswell.xml</A> --
and

2)      Suggest that we flesh out Metagovernment's strategic plan --
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/MGP.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/MGP.xml</A> -- into a *performance plan* incorporating
proposed inputs, processes, and outputs (and associated stakeholders,
particularly of the performer type) along the lines that Ed is suggesting.



While AIIM's StratML Committee is just beginning to specify Part 2 of the
StratML standard, which will contain the elements of performance plans and
reports, we anticipate having a first draft of the schema before the
committee's next telecon on Tuesday, April 14.
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#WorkResults">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#WorkResults</A>



It would be neat if Metagovernment.org could use its own Metascore software
to enable stakeholder feedback on the elements of its own strategic and
performance plans.  The sooner we ourselves begin to do what we are
suggesting, the sooner we can expect to seriously think that others may wish
to start doing likewise.



Needless to say, if there is will among the group to do so, I will be happy
to render Metagovernment's performance plan in conformance with the
soon-to-be available first-draft of the schema for Part 2 of the StratML
standard, as a proof-of-concept pilot test of the draft schema as well as in
support of the vision of Metagovernment.

I agree with promoting the project even though that costs money.
Raising it is something we want to do, but first we have to tackle
some barriers, like forming a non-profit organization and opening a
bank account. Please refer yourself to <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/">http://www.metagovernment.org/</A>
wiki/Startup/Organization, this will give you a better view of the
problematic.

We already have a Facebook group. It is true we aren't using it for
promoting, but *you* can change that ;)

Bye,
Mat?as
