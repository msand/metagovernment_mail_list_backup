<PRE>Thanks for the status update, Ed -- particularly with respect to what has
*not* yet been accomplished.  (Few organizations are as forthcoming about
that as they should be.)

Enabling stakeholders to track information like this in near-real time (not
merely in &quot;annual&quot; reports) is among the prospective purposes of Part 2 of
the StratML standard, which will address the elements of performance plans
and reports. <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#WorkResults">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#WorkResults</A>

While I am not a software programmer, I will continue to be on the lookout
for opportunities to help Metagovernment.org pursue its mission (in the
event that the output might be used to facilitate stakeholder feedback on
the elements of strategic plans).  <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/MGP.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/MGP.xml</A> 

BTW, with respect to &quot;promotion,&quot; I have volunteered to help make the
StratML collection available via the Obama administration's
soon-to-be-launched data.gov site, if the managers of that project would
like to do so.  <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#StratPlans">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#StratPlans</A>  If that occurs,
it will raise the visibility of the StratML collection and perhaps in turn
the mission, values, and goal of the Metagovernment project.

Subject: [Start] List's 1-year anniversary

While metagovernment.org was published about two years ago, this list  
did not form until April 10, 2008. So its 1-year anniversary is this  
Friday.

What have we accomplished in one year?
- List grew from 11 to 76 members
- Software is under development, a complex task given the underpinnings
- Overall concept has changed and matured significantly
- Proposals made to Project 10^100 and FP7
- Wiki (published June 20) has 107 members and ~25K hits on home page
- Ed, Pietro, (and others?) have presented the project in various venues
- Discussion of a formal organization has begun
- Outreach to ~10 national/local-oriented DD organizations
- Mentions in 3 large publications/networks
- (What else?)

What haven't we accomplished?
- Participation has been rather low, even by the more involved members
- Organization hasn't evolved beyond an adhocracy (not necessarily a  
bad thing)
- Haven't been able to attract many dedicated developers

In recognition of our anniversary, please help with promotion in one  
or more of the following ways:

1. Help promote the project by doing one or more of the following:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate#Promote">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate#Promote</A>

2. Help with the code, or help recruit coders or interface designers.  
If you know of a place to post a help-wanted message, please do so.
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate#Program_Metascore">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate#Program_Metascore</A>

3. Use and give feedback on the prototype: <A HREF="http://prototype.metascore.org">http://prototype.metascore.org</A>

4. Think of something else. This is an adhocracy after all. :)

Congrats on our first year, folks.
