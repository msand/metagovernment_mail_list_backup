<PRE>That's truly wonderful news, Pietro and Giovani. Thank you for your  
dedicated work!

Do you see this as something that can readily mesh with the existing  
prototype, or does it itself rise to the level of a separate prototype?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pietro, are you able to talk about FP7 now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear Ed,
</I>&gt;<i> dear list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, in vague terms I can. In more precise terms not yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The FP7 proposal was sent, and it was good. I am very pleased by the
</I>&gt;<i> resulting document.
</I>&gt;<i> We are now a series of 6 partners, of which 5 scientific. Coimbra is
</I>&gt;<i> mainly involved in developing the new knowledge, given the past
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge. Essentially what we all have been interested. In doing this
</I>&gt;<i> we will have enough money to employ at least 2 PhD students, and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Part of our work will be done in investigating and employing the full
</I>&gt;<i> power of the tags.
</I>&gt;<i> Another part in describing how given n people who are proposing
</I>&gt;<i> solutions on a topic we can integrate them in a coherent whole. We
</I>&gt;<i> proposed two different solutions, on the spot, but we also said we
</I>&gt;<i> will investigate for any other solution that might work.
</I>&gt;<i> (A personal thanks to Mathias who sent me a book reference on voting.
</I>&gt;<i> That book is great, I think you should share it with the whole group.
</I>&gt;<i> Not only I referenced it in the proposal, but I learned a great deal
</I>&gt;<i> from it. Thanks again.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see one of the PhD student will mainly work on the tags, and the
</I>&gt;<i> other on synthesizing group knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I expect that in Coimbra, we will all work generally as a team, with
</I>&gt;<i> everybody feeding each other with ideas. One other partner is
</I>&gt;<i> specifically employed to program all this stuff at a professional
</I>&gt;<i> level. Which mean that although we are all going to program, we will
</I>&gt;<i> also have a lot of help from outside. So we can focus on the research
</I>&gt;<i> behind it. The prior work, the possible solutions. In short make a dam
</I>&gt;<i> good work!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just received some preliminary data, and we are competing with other
</I>&gt;<i> 50 projects for about 10 positions. So one project on 5 will get
</I>&gt;<i> funded. I think we have reasonable chances, as I see our project as
</I>&gt;<i> really good. But then I have been told that NO ONE gets more than 30%
</I>&gt;<i> (or less that 10%) of probability in this game. It is a lot a matter
</I>&gt;<i> of luck, and often is the wrong project that gets funded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that among the elements of the project we are also suggesting to
</I>&gt;<i> fund a conference each year in Europe on the topic. This will not only
</I>&gt;<i> promote the project but bring on the awareness on the topic. I think
</I>&gt;<i> if our project gets funded, this might be one of the greatest reasons
</I>&gt;<i> of interests for our list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please forgive me if I cannot enter more in the detail. There is a lot
</I>&gt;<i> more, and it is all really cool. Of course all the members of this
</I>&gt;<i> list can apply for a PhD position, although I will need to take the
</I>&gt;<i> best that appears to me, without making any favoritism toward anybody.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Manuel, FYI, another partner is another German University, so you
</I>&gt;<i> might want to apply there if you don't fancy applying for the the
</I>&gt;<i> warmth, and sun of Portugal, or someone with a stronger CV appears.
</I>&gt;<i> But the synthesizing group knowledge stuff, and the tags, are only
</I>&gt;<i> happening here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also all the code that is being produced will be released, although I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think this will be done as it is produced, but as it is common
</I>&gt;<i> in academic it will be released at the end (or halfway).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now we have a big jigsaw of competing interests that need to be put
</I>&gt;<i> together to go forward. If I sent you any info on this stuff, please
</I>&gt;<i> wait to use it until it has been released (more about it later). We
</I>&gt;<i> want to get something out as soon as possible, and we want to get a
</I>&gt;<i> paper out as soon as possible too. This to permit to everybody to join
</I>&gt;<i> in in the global think tank. And this can only be done when the first
</I>&gt;<i> paper is out to avoid late discussions (if you have worked in academia
</I>&gt;<i> you know what I am referring to).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the paper in turn need to wait until the EU has evaluated our  
</I>&gt;<i> project.
</I>&gt;<i> Also the paper will need some simple test cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SO what I think will happen is that
</I>&gt;<i> a) we shall write a small prototype of a few ideas, and go forward
</I>&gt;<i> with that. I am so excited about this stuff that I cannot sit still
</I>&gt;<i> unless I know some work is progressing.
</I>&gt;<i> b)  the prototype will enter an extensive alpha stage that will enter
</I>&gt;<i> when the paper is out, and the EU has evaluated the project (with ANY
</I>&gt;<i> result).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While the project is in alpha stage some people of this list will be
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to play with it. But not the general public, or people we
</I>&gt;<i> don't know. This because the EU project evaluation is tied to this
</I>&gt;<i> work, and we don't want to screw that up, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I should also mention that you should all greatly thank Giovani for
</I>&gt;<i> the work done. Not only he started this whole FP7 project, he also
</I>&gt;<i> worked for it until the last day, making often the nights ( I would
</I>&gt;<i> receive emails in the morning), and he really worked hard in
</I>&gt;<i> accommodating and smoothing out some hardness we had inside the group
</I>&gt;<i> due to real big cultural differences. Without him the proposal would
</I>&gt;<i> not only have started, but also once started not have reached this
</I>&gt;<i> level. Even if the proposal will not be approved, the ideas we
</I>&gt;<i> developed and clarified in the proposal will keep on going forward
</I>&gt;<i> (although at a slower rate). And this by itself is a great success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Manuel, Mathias, and Ed, I know I sent you some info about a few of
</I>&gt;<i> the ideas we were working on. Please keep those info for yourself, and
</I>&gt;<i> wait before applying them (even in your personal project). It is
</I>&gt;<i> fairly important that it all appears (as it actually was) that those
</I>&gt;<i> ideas were generated from the FP7 team. If someone finds some of those
</I>&gt;<i> ideas released out in the open, he might think that the ideas were not
</I>&gt;<i> original, and then the whole project is at risk. Plus it would be
</I>&gt;<i> quite unfair toward those who came out with them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am right now in England, in the same town of one of the EU partners,
</I>&gt;<i> and we have already started some preliminary work, and test cases on
</I>&gt;<i> the prototype. Stay tuned.
</I>&gt;<i>
