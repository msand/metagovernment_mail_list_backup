<PRE>Hello all,
 
Ed, thanks for the call out to DemocracyLab
&lt;<A HREF="http://democracylab.project2059.org/">http://democracylab.project2059.org/</A>&gt; .  We're in the midst of setting
priorities for our next round of development, and would welcome any
suggestions.  Top on my list is a more engaging home page (we're working
towards page 11 here: <A HREF="https://clearspace.democracylab.org/docs/DOC-1133">https://clearspace.democracylab.org/docs/DOC-1133</A>).
Next is building a feature enabling community scaling.  The most frequent
desire I hear when talking about this project is to be able to carve out an
instance for an organizational purpose.  I think accomplishing this will be
an important milestone in the project's development.
 
If anyone has an itch to take a look at the source code, you can find it
here: <A HREF="https://clearspace.democracylab.org/docs/DOC-1090.">https://clearspace.democracylab.org/docs/DOC-1090.</A>  Any and all
feedback is welcome.  Our intent is for this project to evolve and improve
as rapidly as possible, and to engage a broad development community.
 
Best regards,
Mark

Subject: Re: [Start] applications and vocabularies enabling public debates
 
Thank you for including me in this discussion, Owen. I am cc'ing the
Metagovernment list server, as others there are likely to have a better and
deeper understanding of what is being talked about here than I can.
 
In reference to your earlier comment, Metagovernment is not focused on
software as much as on our basic principles:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles</A>
and on the concept that the internet opens up greatly superior alternatives
to representative democracy (specifically, we wish to build - by whatever
means - an eventual replacement for representative democracy, not just in
political government but in any governance setting). Everyone receiving this
message is quite welcome to join our open group:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate</A>
 
I agree that we will need a good data structure for communities to be able
to share their findings... and perhaps their members. This becomes
especially important in cascading communities, i.e. where there is a
hierarchy of progressively scaling communities.
 
I would also like to point out another project which is somewhat similar to
Metagovernment but has a more formalized structure:
<A HREF="http://www.democracylab.org/">http://www.democracylab.org/</A>
which you can see instantiated here:
<A HREF="http://democracylab.project2059.org/">http://democracylab.project2059.org/</A>
 
P.S. While the Metagovernment list is open for anyone to join, only
subscribers can post to it. If you do not wish to join, please feel free to
still include the list address as a recipient to your reply and I will
approve your non-member post. However, you are very much encouraged to just
join our very interesting global group.

It will be interesting to see whether Debategraph can be productively used
to enable stakeholders to provide feedback on the strategic goals and
objectives of organizations whose missions and values are of interest to
them.

Subject: RE: applications and vocabularies enabling public debates
 
Hi David and All,
It would be very interesting having a look of the public ontology that you
use or could implement based on your data model. I didn't find any document
about that ontology on the Debategraph site. Are you going to implement it ?
And in which language RDFS, OWL ? Do you have any plan to set up a SPARQL
endpoint other than the API in order to make queries over the maps?

Thanks, Vassilios and Luigi. 
 
A couple of quick updates:
 
(1) We are working on an API to open up the public maps - and I would
welcome feedback from the group on any specific characteristics / features
you would like to see with / from the API.
 
(2) It is straightforward for us to implement different ontologies in
Debategraph (in addition to the public one we have three more operating
behind the scenes - as part of our internal architecture). So if anyone is
interested in experimenting with this, let me know. We plan to add a UI soon
to allow you to define and implement your own ontologies directly via the
web. 
 
Finally, if anyone is D.C. based and would like to meet, I'll be in
Washington towards the end of this month.
