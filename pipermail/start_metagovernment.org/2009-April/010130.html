<PRE>While metagovernment.org was published about two years ago, this list  
did not form until April 10, 2008. So its 1-year anniversary is this  
Friday.

What have we accomplished in one year?
- List grew from 11 to 76 members
- Software is under development, a complex task given the underpinnings
- Overall concept has changed and matured significantly
- Proposals made to Project 10^100 and FP7
- Wiki (published June 20) has 107 members and ~25K hits on home page
- Ed, Pietro, (and others?) have presented the project in various venues
- Discussion of a formal organization has begun
- Outreach to ~10 national/local-oriented DD organizations
- Mentions in 3 large publications/networks
- (What else?)

What haven't we accomplished?
- Participation has been rather low, even by the more involved members
- Organization hasn't evolved beyond an adhocracy (not necessarily a  
bad thing)
- Haven't been able to attract many dedicated developers

In recognition of our anniversary, please help with promotion in one  
or more of the following ways:

1. Help promote the project by doing one or more of the following: <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate#Promote">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate#Promote</A>

2. Help with the code, or help recruit coders or interface designers.  
If you know of a place to post a help-wanted message, please do so. <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate#Program_Metascore">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate#Program_Metascore</A>

3. Use and give feedback on the prototype: <A HREF="http://prototype.metascore.org">http://prototype.metascore.org</A>

4. Think of something else. This is an adhocracy after all. :)

Congrats on our first year, folks.
