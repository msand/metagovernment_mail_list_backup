&gt;<i> his, and I had to leave early to prepare). However, Pietro and/or Manuel,

&gt;<i> think you may want to talk to him about leveraging his tool toward

</I>FP7
&gt;<i> proposal?)

This is somewhat similar to the way we had the navigation between
related messages/issues/changes/proposals structured at one point.
Even now there we use this, only that we cut the potion of the
displayed graph off at the first node. Basically you had an part of
the graph displayed in a hierarchy as with debategraph and could
navigate through it. We found that it wasn't very clear what was being
displayed.

More generally I think we as programmers and mathematicians have a
tendency to use graphs and trees to display structure. I'm not sure
this is the case for the average user, or at least it has to be
actually visually displayed as such, which is why I think the
hyperbolic graph display may work out. The traditional threaded
display on the other hand isn't very scalable or usable, but it seems
to be the best we can do for now. In more modern HTML  and browsers we
may use the canvas tag and javascript for a much clearer display of
the graph.
