<PRE>Matias, I personally cannot answer your question, &quot;Why do we need money for
anything other then servers?&quot;  Certainly, I am not looking to be paid for
any contributions I am making to Metagovernment.org.

However, money in and of itself is not a bad thing.  The problem with it is
that it often flows: 

a) inconsistently with our personal values (principles) -- or at least what
we *think* our values are or ostensibly avow them to be -- and

b) without complete, reliable, and accurate accounting (records) and
reporting to stakeholders (particularly those whose money is being spent,
directly or indirectly).

If the latter occurs, the former is much less likely.  (However, how we
spend our money says more about our true values than what we avow them to
be, and all too often our actions are based upon short-term (immediate)
wishes rather than longer-term needs.)

Of course, too, another problem with money is that it tends to lose its
value due to government policies promoting inflation.  I don't think we need
to get into that discussion in this context, but if anyone cares to do so,
here are a couple references:

	<A HREF="http://economics.about.com/od/demandformoney/a/money_value.htm">http://economics.about.com/od/demandformoney/a/money_value.htm</A>

<A HREF="http://www.smallisbeautiful.org/local_currencies.html">http://www.smallisbeautiful.org/local_currencies.html</A> 

BTW, having discovered the latter, I looked for a strategic plan on their
site.  Although I don't see one, I took the liberty of inferring one from
the information provided at <A HREF="http://www.smallisbeautiful.org/about.html">http://www.smallisbeautiful.org/about.html</A> It is
now available in StratML format at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Nonprofits">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Nonprofits</A> or, more specifically,
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/EFSS.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/EFSS.xml</A> It is the 497th plan indexed in Mark Logic's
StratML search service prototype --
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#SearchServices">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#SearchServices</A> -- in which it currently
ranks 1st among 12 referencing &quot;currency&quot;.  (49 plans reference &quot;money&quot; but
theirs is not among them, as it is currently documented.)

Susan, I encourage you to check out the emerging Strategy Markup Language
(StratML) standard, whose prospective purposes are outlined at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes</A> Under the auspices of
AIIM, we aim to establish it as an international voluntary consensus
standard for potential use by all organizations worldwide.  Its purposes are
highly supportive of your mission.  You may also wish to consider
partnership opportunities with Metagovernment.org, whose mission, values,
and goal are available in StratML format at:
