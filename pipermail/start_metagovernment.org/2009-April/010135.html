<PRE>I would like to ask that people working on this project present a very  
brief progress report about what you have been working on.

Manuel, I know you have been busy with other projects this month, but  
if you or Fabe could talk about the state of the code, it would be  
great for the rest of the group to know where you stand (and what  
others can do to help).

Pietro, are you able to talk about FP7 now?

Mat&#237;as, would you like to talk about your thoughts on Wikimania?

Me, I was supposed to be working on researching the requirements for  
starting a non-profit in the U.S. and have not gotten very far due to  
a crushing personal and business schedule, but I do hope to be able to  
get to this work in the next 1-2 weeks. Also, I will be attending  
eDemocracy Camp and the Politics Online conference next weekend, where  
I will be speaking and networking on behalf of the project. Those are  
listed here: <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore</A>

Anyone else? This list now has 78 members, but the majority of those  
are completely inactive these days. What will it take to get your  
active involvement? Don't forget, you can always look to <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate</A> 
  for ideas about what you can do *right now* to help the project.

</PRE>
