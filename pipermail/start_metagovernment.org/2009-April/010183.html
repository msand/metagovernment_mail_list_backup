<PRE>All,

I'm really excited to share something that I recently discovered which might
be of interest!

Instead of linking to the front of the website, I wanted to share the end
result, which I believe to be a perfect model for metaScore:

<A HREF="http://christopherritter.uservoice.com/">http://christopherritter.uservoice.com/</A>

This is the UserVoice.com forum for my personal website. If you have any
ideas for building my personal brand, please feel free to add them in the
suggestion box. I have added a few ideas to get the ball rolling. For
example, I believe that it is important to start a WordPress blog, so I
added +3 to my own suggestion. If you like this idea, you can +1 (or 2 or 3)
it as well! Sound familar?

I thought it was important to recognize the similarities to metaScore before
viewing the entire UserVoice site -- because it, too, is awesome.

UserVoice seems to have a great business model around their voting system.
Apart from all of their business associations, they weave quite seamlessly
into the social web, while offering services for open source applications:

Does anyone else think that metaScore could learn something from
UserVoice.com?
