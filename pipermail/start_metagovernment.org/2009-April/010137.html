<PRE>&gt;<i> Manuel, I know you have been busy with other projects this month, but if you
</I>&gt;<i> or Fabe could talk about the state of the code, it would be great for the
</I>&gt;<i> rest of the group to know where you stand (and what others can do to help).
</I>
Over the weekend I've been trying to figure out how the system could
be drastically simplified. I'm hoping to find a way to naturally
express the interactions required by the user when interacting between
different repositories. So far it's all still pen and paper.

I'm also fairly busy at the moment, so if somebody wants to continue
with metascore in the meantime, I would gladly help you get started.
As the main task for the moment is still in the design of the system,
coding knowledge would be nice since it would give you an idea of the
constraints we have to work within, but it's not strictly needed.
Especially knowledge of DVCS and user interface design is needed.

I think that we should work out the interactions in the system better
before we start further work on the code, since the redesign will
probably be fairly major.
