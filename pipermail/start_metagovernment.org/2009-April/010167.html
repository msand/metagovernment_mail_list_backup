<PRE>You make very good points, Gustavo, and I don't think we're leaning  
toward user scoring in the immediate future. But to be clear, your  
example is the same one I used to prove the opposite point...

If user scores are community-specific, then Britney Spears would have  
nearly god-like status in the community of her own fan-club, but she  
would have marginally more than zero status in the community of  
nuclear proliferation debate. A highly respected nuclear scientist  
would face the opposite situation.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes but where does it come from? There has to be a source from which

</I>&gt;<i> proportionally more of the currency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A possible solution is paying for services to the community with the
</I>&gt;<i> currency. The community needs somebody to do some research on a topic,
</I>&gt;<i> make a proposal summarize a debate (whatever may be of value to them).
</I>&gt;<i> Collectively they agree to pay a certain amount. Once the system is
</I>&gt;<i> running you can adjust inflation with intrest/deprication rates based
</I>&gt;<i> on the total amount in circulation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since fiat currencies have a bad history though, it would be good to
