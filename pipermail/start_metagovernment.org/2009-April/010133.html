<PRE>Ed's reference to &quot;ground swell&quot; prompts me to:

 

1)      Forward a link to the StratML document in which the essence of the
book by that name is distilled -- <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/Groundswell.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/Groundswell.xml</A> --
and

2)      Suggest that we flesh out Metagovernment's strategic plan --
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/MGP.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/MGP.xml</A> -- into a *performance plan* incorporating
proposed inputs, processes, and outputs (and associated stakeholders,
particularly of the performer type) along the lines that Ed is suggesting.

 

While AIIM's StratML Committee is just beginning to specify Part 2 of the
StratML standard, which will contain the elements of performance plans and
reports, we anticipate having a first draft of the schema before the
committee's next telecon on Tuesday, April 14.
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#WorkResults">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#WorkResults</A>  

 

It would be neat if Metagovernment.org could use its own Metascore software
to enable stakeholder feedback on the elements of its own strategic and
performance plans.  The sooner we ourselves begin to do what we are
suggesting, the sooner we can expect to seriously think that others may wish
to start doing likewise.

 

Needless to say, if there is will among the group to do so, I will be happy
to render Metagovernment's performance plan in conformance with the
soon-to-be available first-draft of the schema for Part 2 of the StratML
standard, as a proof-of-concept pilot test of the draft schema as well as in
support of the vision of Metagovernment.

Subject: [Start] sign ups for ordinary memebers ie the general public

 

Hi,
I came across your project some time ago, glad to see that it is 
progressing nicely.

I have a suggestion, I think that you should have a list of supporters, 
so that the general public can get involved &amp; we can then create a 
ground swell of support out in the real world.

We need to convince people in the real world that this is a viable 
alternative, we need the general public involved, we are never going to 
get the support for this idea if we do not, we NEED a sign &amp; SUPPORT us 
page, we NEED a LINK to us page, we NEED more public awareness, I have 
mentioned metagovernance to some friend of mine &amp; all I get are puzzled 
looks, I try to explain &amp; I can see their eyes glaze over.

We need more awareness, a facebook page, press releases, adverts on 
radio, if this take money, lets get fund raising. Our Country &amp; the 
World need a new solution to all of the problems we face the old style 
government does not have ANY of the answers, the old style govt, is part 
of the problem.

C'mon people, do we believe in this or what!

I shall look forward to your reply in due course.

Regards,


Ed Blundell,

PS: I have signed up as a participant as well.
