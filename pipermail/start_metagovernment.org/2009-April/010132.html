<PRE>Hi,
I came across your project some time ago, glad to see that it is
progressing nicely.

I have a suggestion, I think that you should have a list of supporters,
so that the general public can get involved &amp; we can then create a
ground swell of support out in the real world.

We need to convince people in the real world that this is a viable
alternative, we need the general public involved, we are never going to
get the support for this idea if we do not, we NEED a sign &amp; SUPPORT us
page, we NEED a LINK to us page, we NEED more public awareness, I have
mentioned metagovernance to some friend of mine &amp; all I get are puzzled
looks, I try to explain &amp; I can see their eyes glaze over.

We need more awareness, a facebook page, press releases, adverts on
radio, if this take money, lets get fund raising. Our Country &amp; the
World need a new solution to all of the problems we face the old style
government does not have ANY of the answers, the old style govt, is part
of the problem.

C'mon people, do we believe in this or what!

I shall look forward to your reply in due course.

Regards,


Ed Blundell,
