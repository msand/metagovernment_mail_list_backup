<PRE>I was able to attend the below-referenced session, and found that five  
of the six platforms there were not so much debate visualization tools  
as websites which try to organize debates on specific issues. In each  
case, their goal is to inform peoples' decisions about issues, but not  
to help drive toward any sort of consensus.

<A HREF="http://debategraph.org/">http://debategraph.org/</A> however is indeed a sophisticated  
visualization tool. As is I planned on talking with David Price, who  
was presenting it, but was not able to coordinate schedules (my  
presentation was right after his, and I had to leave early to  
prepare). However, Pietro and/or Manuel, I think you may want to talk  
to him about leveraging his tool toward Metascore. (Or Pietro, do you  
already have a visualizer involved in the FP7 proposal?)

I have been conversing with him by e-mail, but I am not the right  
person to carry the conversation forward, so... if one of you would  
like, I'll e-introduce you.

Also <A HREF="http://deepdebate.org/">http://deepdebate.org/</A>  (which was not represented at the above  
panel) is an interesting a deliberately less complex tool which may  
also be of interest.

P.S. I am off on a business trip for the next week so may be sporadic  
in communication. But please do go forward with discussions, of course.

</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I was rather surprised. I haven't had time to review the  
</I>&gt;<i> sites, but am looking forward to that panel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro or Manuel (or others) do you have any specific questions you  
</I>&gt;<i> would like me to direct to them? Pietro, I noticed on the FP7  
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, you suggest a dynamic hyperbolic graph. Might one of these  
</I>&gt;<i> be preferable?

</I>&gt;<i> This group has talked a lot about how to visualize debates, for

</I>&gt;<i> I hope that tomorrow I will be able to get to this session at the  
</I>&gt;<i> POLC:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/The_Future_of_Public_Debate_Online">http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/The_Future_of_Public_Debate_Online</A>
</I>&gt;<i> where I will see several more. Look at the great links on the above  
</I>&gt;<i> page, under &quot;Speakers.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On collaboration systems, <A HREF="http://www.pligg.com/">http://www.pligg.com/</A> seems interesting.  
</I>&gt;<i> Sort of a CMS with an internal Digg-like system. It is open source,  
</I>&gt;<i> uses a 5-star scoring system, and... well, have a look. Somewhat  
</I>&gt;<i> similarly, <A HREF="http://www.mixedink.com/">http://www.mixedink.com/</A> is a mass-collaboration writing  
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also found <A HREF="http://opendialogcoalition.com/web/">http://opendialogcoalition.com/web/</A> interesting and  
</I>&gt;<i> think that they need to talk to both Owen and Pietro about efforts  
</I>&gt;<i> for data normalization and open architectures for sharing between  
</I>&gt;<i> communities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there was more, but I am under-slept and need to rest up for  
</I>&gt;<i> POLC tomorrow. I'll try to write about that, but am leaving the next  
</I>&gt;<i> day on a business trip so may be on limited involvement for another  
</I>&gt;<i> week.
