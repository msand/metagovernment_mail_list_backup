<PRE>Update on this: I looked into creating a Metagovernment Facebook group
and discovered there already is one (created way back in 2008, long
before I joined this list). I tried to join it, but got no response.
It says &quot;Pietro, Jacqueline and Mat&#237;as are admins.&quot;: Could one of you
please let me in? I'd also volunteer to become an admin. I'd also
recommend just removing the approval requirement: The member names and
posts are already public so I see no advantage to putting a gate
across joining, especially if it isn't going to be monitored.

Also, the Metagovernment FB page itself is gone, which means the info
on <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate</A> is obsolete (it doesn't
even list the FB group). When we get the FB group problem worked out,
I'll volunteer to edit that page to deprecate the mailing list and put
the FB group as the primary contact.

If anyone is still into the original mission of metagovernment,
there's a marketing opportunity here too: There are several direct
democracy groups on FB that are fairly active, but most are country or
region-specific. It'd be good to market the Metagovernment group as an
umbrella group for them to use to connect for more general topic
discussions.

Mailing lists I think are practically obsolete now that gmail is
classifying more and more of them as spam (this is not the only list
I'm having trouble with) so unless someone wants to moderate a Reddit
group (the only other viable alternative I'm aware of) we need to move
to the FB group if we're going to continue to collaborate in this
field.
  Thanks,
    Scott

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good stuff. Glad to see it up again. However this e-mail ended up in my spam folder. Only now checked it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, this mailing list is about useless, and surely more trouble than
</I>&gt;<i> it's worth. Even though I've set up a gmail filter so messages don't
</I>&gt;<i> get marked as spam, they still come in with a big yellow warning label
</I>&gt;<i> at the top. My recommendation would be for Ed to create a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Metagovernment&quot; Facebook Group (takes like 5 minutes, not counting
</I>&gt;<i> finding or creating the image FB shows at the top of each group),
</I>&gt;<i> email everyone on this list personally (so the message doesn't get
</I>&gt;<i> shoved into their Spam folders) asking them to join the new group,
</I>&gt;<i> then just shut this one down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking of which, I've set up a Group for proxyfor.me:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/groups/proxyfor.me/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/proxyfor.me/</A> that I encourage everyone
</I>&gt;<i> to join. I shut down the PHPBB forum I had running on matchism.org due
</I>&gt;<i> to lack of interest and the fact that it was a significant time sink:
</I>&gt;<i> Damn Russian bots, they just ruin everything, including I guess the US
</I>&gt;<i> attempt at misrepresentative democracy ;-) They're pinging proxyfor.me
</I>&gt;<i> all the time, but since it's a fully custom system their script kits
</I>&gt;<i> aren't any help breaking in. Yet, anyway :-/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've got the new version of the app with authentication done and am
</I>&gt;<i> now working on the proposals to be voted on. Which means the hard part
</I>&gt;<i> is done so it should be just another few weeks before we can resume
</I>&gt;<i> public testing on it...
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I've updated and restarted proxyfor.me. It's still on AWS, but uses an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; internal HTTPS certificate and server rather than using the (much more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; expensive) AWS ELB system for that. It's also updated to the latest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; versions of the tools and libraries, and there has been a *lot* of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; progress on those over the past year: The new app is about 80% smaller
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and only takes a third of the time to start up, mostly due to AOT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; compilation (which works in Angular now but didn't in the version I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; started with).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I had to toss all the old profiles when I updated the database schema
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to handle authentication, but have set it up in a &quot;demo&quot; mode where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you can log in as one of the bots to check it out without having to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; fill out your profile first (instructions are on the startup screen).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm not going to do any PR for this release: I'll wait until I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the authentication stuff and new local (Boulder/Denver) proposals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; finished and will call that Beta 4.
