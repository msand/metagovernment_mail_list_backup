<PRE>I think you need to change the fundamental question here to something
closer to what is achievable. The difficult thing is there is not a real
way to gauruntee a person online is who they say. Even if an account is
real it may have been hacked for example. So positively identifing someone
through block chain would suffer from similar set backs. There is a way
around this however.

If the question isn't a binary, &quot;Is this person who they say they are right
now?&quot;, but instead, &quot;what level of confidence do I have that this account
is who they say they are?&quot;, it becomes more possible to answer. The
technology for this already exists in the form of pgp key signing.

The basic idea of pgp key signing is that with the people I directly work I
have the highest level of trust that the person behind the account is who
they say. I sign their key with my key and they sign mine saying to each
other, &quot; yeah I trust this&quot;. While it may be an obvious connection at this
level, when you have a web of people it gets more interesting. Because,
meeting everyone in the world is impossible I can use the number of
signatures between me and another person to evaluate how much I can trust a
key. The closer the connection directly, or how many people I trust are
connected to this person contributes to this number. Also, Facebook
released a statistic that through all of the users of Facebook any two
people anywhere in the world are only separated by 5 or 6 connections, so
establishing trust with larger populations of people become fairly
reasonable.

The next step would be who would pay for the system of checking and
registering pgp keys. We already have a great example of a decentralised
system with how domain registers and DNS works. Following their example you
wouldn't even need bitcoin blockchain technology. You could still use the
technology within the system, but that is not the only way it would work.

I have thought much about this but am running to an appointment, so I
thought I would send it out what I have written here and try and respond to
any questions you all have.

Cheers,
James
