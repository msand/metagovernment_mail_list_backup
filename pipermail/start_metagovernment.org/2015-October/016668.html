<PRE>Dear Jacopo,

thank you for your appeal. It is interesting topic.

When it comes to my experience, I would say that it really depends on
the proposal. I will show it on some extreme proposals, but I claim that
it is valid in general, not just in examples.

First example. Small discussion, a few of decision makers. When I agree
with my neighbour to repair the dirt road between our fields, the
required members are me and my neighbour and the proposal is valid
even if we were just two and the road is in fact public.

Second example. Huge discussion, one decision maker. In our
Metagovernment, there might be huge discussion about what to do, but in
the end one person may decide what to do. If he does something and
others don't, than his decision may become valid and accepted in time.

Third example. Huge discussion, population of decision makers.
Declaring war of aggression is very improbable in healthy society.
From my point of view the discussion is valid if it was equal and the
decision is valid just to the extent of how much is supported (and
opposed).

I was testing some less extreme examples in reality. Validity is
assumed till some contrary decision with more supporters appears. The
cost of error is attributed by the proposal with more supporters. The
costs may be attributed to the people that decided/executed the now
invalid proposal. I am working with volunteers, so the cost is their
wasted resources, effort and shame, because they were expecting wrong
validity. But this may work also if some bigger budget exist. The
errors of validity are quite rare, because there is motivation to
explore the correct validity in advance.

When I describe it as a process of two contrary proposals. Validity of
&quot;Proposal 1&quot; is assumed. Later, contrary &quot;Proposal 2&quot; has more
supporters and proves &quot;Proposal 1&quot; to be invalid (cost may be
attributed). Later &quot;Proposal 1&quot; has support of 51% of population and
proves &quot;Proposal 2&quot; to be invalid (costs may be attributed). Even later,
&quot;Proposal 2&quot; has reached highher supormajority 70% and proves old
majority &quot;Proposal 1&quot; invalid (costs may be attributed).And so forth...

I expect some constant to exist that is making decisions invalid in
time. It is because the situation changes, poeple mature and die. So we
test to substract 2% of support for every year since the proposal
became valid.

Ah,this mail is too long now, I will better stop here.
I hope this was helpful, was it?

Cheers
m.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was thinking about my project and created two criteria
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.The project should be defendable worldwide. It must have academic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; qualities.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.My local neighbours should have net utility from it at every stage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the project. They should participate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to say, I need good theory, but I also need something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; useful for ordinary people all the time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, why I am writing this. I feel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I need to work with my neighbours more and that I will not be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much active in the latest GitHub project. Still I am here to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; participate a little bit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And what about you? Do not you need to work with your neighbours
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more? Do they participate regularly in your project? Why not?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers
