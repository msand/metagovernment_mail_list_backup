<PRE>Hi, Michael. A few responses in-line below.

This seems both elegant and useful.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Or via a .htaccess file in the directory itself?
</I>
I'll answer most of these together. I am using a small cPanel account, which is fairly restricted. Yes, it is Apache (2.2), but I don't have a lot of power within it. It does not (and I checked, it will not) support and of those modules. Additionally, apparently this provider does not give me direct access to the pipermail archives. I now recall looking into that before: to migrate the list, I need to get the help of their tech support to get at the files.

So all of that may be further impetus to move away from this host. I have not looked into what Tuxfamily supports nor what capabilities it would provide.

This leads me to a tangent... I had at one point been thinking of setting up metagov as a mirrorable site. There is no perfect mirroring of mediawiki, but it is my understanding that I could make backups of it publicly available, and other people could make restores of it to their sites, thus making effective if slightly out-of-date mirrors. (They would just need to suspend edit capabilities and instead drive people to the master site for edits.) This would allow us to have some freedom from the authority of a single administrator (uh, me, for now), as other admins of other hosts could fork if they think I've gone rogue. :)

This of course doesn't have anything to do with the list server archives, but I think it's relevant because it means we would need to support a pretty vanilla web host environment, since the mirrors could all be different.

&gt;<i> Meantime, I can look into what's involved in migrating to TuxFamily.
</I>&gt;<i> Is this the latest information on that?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Upgrade_backlog#TuxFamily_Migration">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Upgrade_backlog#TuxFamily_Migration</A>
</I>
Yes, that's where I left it (quite some time ago; ahem). As I am trying to get at above... is tux a proper place to go, or should we look for something more flexible/powerful?
