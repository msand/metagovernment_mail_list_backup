<PRE>We propose to use the facilities of Metagov as a plug-in framework for
e-democracy tools and practices.  Conseo, Thomas and I spoke of this
earlier and we agreed to ask the community for permission. [1]

1. Key points
-------------

  a) We deploy the main user interface of Votorola [2] in Metagov web
     pages, including the wiki pages and the mailing list archive.

  b) We make it known that we want other projects to do the same.  If
     they do not have software with this capability, they can either
     copy ours (we'll help them), or build their own.

  c) Together with the second project that joins, we develop a neutral
     tool switch.  It has these functions:

       * Allows each Metagov participant to choose which project's
         toolset to run on Metagov pages.  So different participants
         may run different toolsets.

       * Assigns a random toolset to each new participant.

       * Allows the user to switch toolsets on the fly, or to opt out
         altogether.

  d) All the while, we work (each in our own projects) to ensure our
     toolsets integrate nicely with Metagov practices.


2. Rationale
------------
These are own reasons, but we think they dovetail neatly with
Metagov's aims and methods:

  a) We lower the barrier to cooperation among technical projects.
     The initial cooperation we expect is not vote mirroring, but
     simply the development of a tool switch that enables shared
     exposure of tools on Metagov.  Our experience tells us this can
     be hacked together in a matter of weeks, if not days.

  b) We get exposure on Metagov for Votorola.  Metagov is neutral
     ground and it attracts higher traffic than our own sites.

  c) We get exposure for the idea of cross-project cooperation for
     the sake of healthy competition as opposed to winner-take-all
     brutality.


Does anyone have questions?  What do you think of the idea?

Conseo, Thomas and Mike

  [2] The main UI of Votorola is the Crossforum Theatre stage:

      It's unfinished.  Two more tracks are on the way.  It's tested
      only on Firefox and Chrome, and IE is not yet supported.
