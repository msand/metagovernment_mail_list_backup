<PRE>Thomas and Ed,

&gt;<i> Wow, the switch came fast! I like it!
</I>
Thank you!  (I posted about the Votorola bug here)
<A HREF="http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/2012-November/001540.html">http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/2012-November/001540.html</A>

I agree with Ed that the introductory banner and homepage ought to
work together.  They have complimentary strengths.  The banner is
everywhere, while the homepage has more room for explanatory content.
I also like Ed's proposed content for the homepage.

Here's a rough, first proposal for the content of the banner:


                      Metagovernment

        0                  0                    0            0     
    '       V          '       V            '       V    '       V 

   '    +--&gt; I        '    +    I          '    +    I  '    +    I

    '       '          '       X &lt;--+       '       X    '       X 
        '                  '        |           '            '
                                    |
      Choose             Offer -----+         Extend  ---&gt;
      ------             -----                ------


This is visible to newcomers on all Metagov pages.  The text at top is
a link to the home page.  The primary message of the graphical story
beneath is directed at toolset developers.  It says, &quot;Put your toolset
here or you're gonna be a loser.&quot;

The first graphic (left) is a live toolset switch, initially set on
the introductory toolset (i.e. the banner).  When the mouse is over
the left third of the banner, the text at top transitions to:

   Choose any toolset you want

(middle) The graphic is faded except for the X and the &quot;insertion&quot;
arrow, which are lit as links.  They lead to instructions for
developers.  When the mouse is over the middle third of the banner,
the text at top transitions to:

   Offer your own toolset.

(right) The graphic is faded except for the &quot;extension&quot; arrow and the
rightmost switch, which are lit as links.  They lead to instructions
for administrators.  When the mouse is over the right third of the
banner, the text at top transitions to:

   Extend these choices to your own community.

What do you think?  Does anyone want to draw a proper mockup?  If not,
I can draw one (after I fix my bugs).

(Thank you!)  We could make the popper brighter by default, as long as
it's possible to dim it down again.  It floats over the toolset or
(when off) the page content, so it normally needs to be inconspicuous
and minimal.  (Unlike colour, the size should probably be invariable,
so developers can easily accomodate it.)

Another possibility: whenever the switch container (banner or switch
window) is dismissed, it could dramatically collapse to the top right
corner, cueing the user to the location of the popper.

</I>&gt;<i> A possible bug: if I switch back and forth between the options, the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I started thinking about what the Introduction banner should say, and I realized I was seeing a lot of redundancy with the proposed new homepage text, e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it make sense to combine these two?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a rough first draft:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Metagovernment project is developing the public tools and practices to enable everyone to have full and meaningful participation in governance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Participating projects are showcasing their tools on this site! Click the triangle in the very upper-right corner of any page to try out different tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And please join our active discussion in our mailing list. There you can provide feedback on these tools, help us develop them and their supporting ideas, and/or showcase your own project on this site.
