<PRE>Hi guys:

Thank you very much Pietro Speroni, Ronald, saizai, Karsten Weihe and Roger Eaton for you E-democracy talk =&gt; <A HREF="http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Meinungsfindungstool/E-democracy_talk">http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Meinungsfindungstool/E-democracy_talk</A> 

I am looking forward to the next talks and to the work of creating our common meta-language for the global discussion system. Why?
With a common meta-language everybody can use his own approach of his discussion platform (program language, data base design, &#8230;). Through embedding meta-language to your web documents, anyone else who knows that meta-language can use the content of your web documents. He can translate it to his own data structure and use it in his own platform. And vice versa ...

To start that process, I would like to find out which are the core concepts that are shared by everyone and what concepts are special but worth to be support through the whole discussion system. For that reason I started a spreadsheet =&gt; <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuifdSOP9E7-dDl3dkk5NVIwUHBSM0lVMXdmNW9nOEE">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuifdSOP9E7-dDl3dkk5NVIwUHBSM0lVMXdmNW9nOEE</A> 

Today we are going to rework our definitions of AG-MFT.
I would like any author of a discussion platform to mark the rows of concepts that he is using with anyone else. Feel free to add any comment.
When you need a further concept that is not yet listed, please add a new row for that new concept and explain it shortly. 
Looking forward working on the self-learning discussion system.

All the best,
