<PRE>I'm a Mark as well. Lol
Just wanted to say hi. And I love what you guys are working on. Its funny I
had imagined all that you guys are doing twenty years ago and seeing it
manifest into reality. It brings a tear to my eye.
One day there will be no more polititions as we know it. We will govern
ourselves. That's such a beautiful thing..
I'm currently establishing my own nation. Myself.
Nothing big just friends and I.
We don't hate the United States.
We just don't agree with what they are doing that's all.
I was always told as a kid. If the other kids don't play nice go somewhere
else and play.
So I don't hate on them. I just want free from their stupid laws they pass.
I mean the seat belt law? Really?
Its just a money making scam. If its that big of a problem then make the
vehicles not run if someone is not in their seat with seat belt on. Easy as
that. No court no fines. just problem solved. If they can put that
technology on lawn mowers its not a problem with cars.
People worry about getting chipped.
I think its a good idea especially for older people that may have a heart
attract. It could detect that and automatically call an ambulance. Or
abducted children. I just don't like the people who are watching and
tracking. But if we had a complete direct democracy it wouldn't bother me.
I honestly think before kids finish school and move on to a career it
should be mandatory to serve in the police. One reason so when they get
older they will respect them because they have been in their shoes and know
what its like.
Just like rotc .but I don't believe in a police state either. I think the
police should be the friendly people who try to help others and not just
hand out fines. Try to keep things out of court. Michigan state troopers
used to be real kool like that. They actually did a little detective work
and fixed the problem or resolved the matter to save all the time. But now
they just hand out fines and take people to jail when they don't pay them.
I really do care about human beings.
People are not my business anymore.
But I've wasted enough of your time. I'm back to work.
I have a whole house to put laminate flooring and ceramic into.

Namaste
