I agree, this an important problem.

&gt;<i> The same applies to the question about the numbers of supporters and
</I>&gt;<i> rejecters of a proposed solution: how do you find out where the
</I>&gt;<i> majority is moving to?
</I>
As you recognize, the problem is not created by our proposal and is
not specific to it.  It already exists out there.  And we don't offer
any specific solution to it.  But we know there are two broad
categories or approaches to a solution.  One approach (A) is to count
on the elimination of other tools.  Ultimately, only a single tool is
left, or a single platform of standard, interchangeable tools.  So the
problem itself is eliminated.  This approach is illustrated here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-October/005111.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-October/005111.html</A>

(B) The other approach stands on a principle of technical equality and
freedom of choice for users.  Any tool is allowed.  It follows that no
solution to the problem of integration can be forced in advance.  Tool
providers are expected to negotiate solutions bilaterally, or opt into
existing technical agreements.  So a mix of solutions is possible and
anything may emerge.  This approach is illustrated here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-October/005114.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-October/005114.html</A>

Several groups have already taken approach A and we can join them.  Or
we can take approach B and be the first.  We know that Metagov has
always been inclined to B in principle.  All we propose here (Conseo,
Thomas and I) is a mechanism to move forward on it.  We rig Metagov as
a plug-in framework with a neutral tool switch.
