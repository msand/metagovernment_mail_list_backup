<PRE>This is a design proposal for a prototype of the plug-in framework.

    Name     Metagovernment plug-in framework
    Trunk    <A HREF="http://hg.tuxfamily.org/metagov/plug/">http://hg.tuxfamily.org/metagov/plug/</A>  (to be created)
    License  MIT
    Stage    Prototype, might be throw-away


Runtime components
------------------
The framework is composed of JavaScript that is loaded into the page
being viewed by the user.  It is initially coded as plain JavaScript,
without commiting to a platform such as jQuery or GWT (so keeping it
as open as possible to new developers).  The main components are:

    Introductory toolset

        A toolset that introduces the framework.  This is the default.
        Its implementation has yet to be agreed.  Meantime it will
        render as a banner that is empty of content except for a
        switch view.

    Switch

        Mechanism for setting the toolset as preferred by the user.
        The switch state is backed by the browser's HTML5 local store.
        If the browser has none, then the switch is disabled and
        locked in the default position (introductory toolset).

    Switch view

        The user interface of the switch.  It will probably look like
        this initially, at least till we can mock up and agree on
        something nicer:

            0. Off
          * 1. Introduction
            2. Votorola

                    (close)

        The user clicks to choose.  The &quot;off&quot; choice is temporarily
        disabled (greyed out) pending demand.  The &quot;close&quot; link only
        appears when the user has explicitly summoned the view, not
        when the view is incorporated in the introductory toolset.


Configuration
-------------
The configuration is mostly in the wiki.  It consists of:

    Toolset category

        Category page, to which all toolset pages belong.

    Toolset page

        One for each toolset.  It records the following information
        which (for now) is manually transcribed into the switch code.

            title - informal name shown on switch view

            wikiLauncher - URL of script for launching the toolset in
               the context of a wiki page.  (there'll be other
               contexts later)

    Toolset registry

        Page listing toolsets by page name.  It is manually
        transcribed into the switch code.


Functions
---------

    Launch

        The toolset launcher is executed at load time before the parse
        of the document is complete.  The steps are:

            1. Read switch, yielding chosen toolset.

            2. Write script element for toolset launcher.  It may be
               written to the head or body (indefinite).

    Switch

        If the switch is not visible, then the user must summon it.
        In Votorola this will entail hovering the mouse at top right
        of the link track (over a small triangle) to expose a button,
        then clicking on the button to display the switch.

        For newcomers, the switch will normally be visible as part of
        the introductory &quot;toolset&quot;.  When the switch is visible:

            1. Receive user's click on chosen toolset.

            2. Set switch state accordingly.

            3. Reload page, launching chosen toolset.

            4. Ensure the switch view is shown again in the same
               location.

        The user may continue switching, or move on to other things.


Comments
--------
In plain JavaScript it'll be a little slower to code.  Still not more
than 10 man days for the first cut, or (for me) 30 calendar days.

Can anyone foresee problems?  Or would anyone else like to code it?
If not, then I can probably start on it myself in a few days.
