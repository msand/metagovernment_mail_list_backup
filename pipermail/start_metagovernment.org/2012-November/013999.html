<PRE>Hi Thomas,

&gt;<i> Mike proposed to make it more clear, that everybodys input
</I>&gt;<i> concerning the homepage is actually welcomed. How, if we we link the
</I>&gt;<i> different page-proposals themselves on the front-page? This would be
</I>&gt;<i> more inviting and clear, wouldn't it?
</I>
I think it would be a gesture in the right direction, but not enough.
I have a better understanding of the problem now that I've thought
about it.  The homepage is directly a product of decision, not of
discussion.  These two modes of activity are incompatible where they
come into immediate, formal contact (i.e. not mediated by people).
One must bow to the other.  If I turn my toolset switch to Votorola,
for instance, then I expect to see the discussion elevated on this
page and the decision suppressed, forced into its proper place.  Its
proper place is to be governed.  We ourselves are daily governed by
rules that are the product of decisions; but those decisions and those
rules are illegitimate unless they, in turn, are governed by our
discussions.  This needs to be assured.  For instance:

  * If the decision (e.g. the content of the homepage) is not what
    people actually agree to in the real world, then that fact should
    be trumpeted over and above the decision, right there on the page.

  * If a significant margin of voices are dissenting, then those
    voices must be present.  I should hear them while I'm reading the
    page.  I should be able to ask them questions, e.g., &quot;Why do you
    disagree with this decision?&quot;

Stuff like that.  If it's not there, then the decision is invalid.
Even our laws and courts are illegitimate if they do not bow at this
particular juncture, where, in formal circumstances, they meet up with
discussion, because discussion is sovereign here.

Or anyway, we can make it so. :-)

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> Also I tend towards Ed's proposal, to put the introductary text on the

</I>&gt;<i> Ed proposed this text in the other thread:
