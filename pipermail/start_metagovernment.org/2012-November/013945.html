<PRE>Hi Marc,

&gt;<i> &gt; ... Either:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A. All documents must implement the agreed meta-data standard.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Non-compliant documents are eliminated.  So fragmentation is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    solved by your solution alone.  Or,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> they can not benefit from the possibilities cooperation would offer
</I>&gt;<i> them.  So yes, if the tools wants to benefit, it needs to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> migrate the data back and forth, but they will not neccessarily be
</I>&gt;<i> eliminated ;o)
</I>
If not, then the outcome cannot be A.  I must clarify that A and B are
alternative outcomes, alternative futures in which the fragmentation
problem raised by Ronald has been solved.  If there still exist at
that time documents that are non-compliant with your solution (the
meta-data standard), then the problem could not have been solved by
that solution alone.  So the outcome must be B:

&gt;<i> &gt; B. Non-compliant documents may implement other, rival solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    So fragmentation is *not* solved by your solution alone.  You
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    depend on the existence of other solutions.
</I>
&gt;<i> That's how it works today.  There are dozen of tools around that all
</I>&gt;<i> implement their own proprietary standards.
</I>
Again, I speak of a future in which the problem is solved.  Although
there exist today *proposed* solutions (such as xDebate formats,
Outcast, Meinungsfindungstool and ODDI), we can hardly find any
implementations of them.  There are maybe 2 or 3 tools compliant with
one solution or another, not dozens.

So the problem is still unsolved.  We have yet to arrive at future A
or B and are still free to choose between them.  What we (Conseo,
Thomas and I) propose is a step toward future B.  Our proposed tool
switch will not prefer any particular solution (xDebate, Outcast,
Meinungsfindungstool, ODDI, etc) over another.

&gt;<i> I would prefer A. But B is even a good starting point that's worth
</I>&gt;<i> proving the goal of adding benefit to those who participate.  If B
</I>&gt;<i> fail, A will fail also.
</I>
Your preference (again) may be based on a miscommunication.  But if
you agree that a step toward B would be a good start, then all we
propose here is a mechanism for that first step.

&gt;<i> For me B provides the most benefit to the developers and providers
</I>&gt;<i> of specific tools and solutions.  And A provides the most benefit to
</I>&gt;<i> the users and content contributors of the tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What audience would you like to attract?
</I>
I would first ask you to clarify how A could benefit users (or anyone)
more than B.  (But here too, I think it was just a miscommunication.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I roughly understand the solution (or counter-solution) you propose,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; except in one regard.  So I have a question at the end.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ronald said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; No, not necessarily [defragmenting the tools]...  This is my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; proposal, how to outbalance the fragmentation of documents...  We
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; agree on a set of meta data, that the tools should support per
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; document...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This sounds like &quot;defragmented&quot; tools to me.  It's an example of that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The tools are no longer disconnected fragments because they share two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connections: first the agreed &quot;meta data&quot; standard, and second, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;consolidated overview&quot; into which they are pushed or pulled. *
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's true. At the end our working group proposes a standardized meta data 
</I>&gt;<i> schema to interchange data between different solutions or tools. Furthermore 
</I>&gt;<i> there is not a &quot;consolidated overview&quot; but defined interfaces that can be 
</I>&gt;<i> queried by the tool A on tool B to retrieve specific data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we both agree (and Marc agrees) that the tools must somehow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (in this meaning) be defragmented.  You offer a specific solution,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while we (Conseo, Thomas and I) do not.  This raises the question of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how your solution relates to what we're proposing in this thread.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer hinges on how you address the problem of fragmented documents
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that are *non-compliant* with your agreed meta-data standard.  Either:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   A. All documents must implement the agreed meta-data standard.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      Non-compliant documents are eliminated.  So fragmentation is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      solved by your solution alone.  Or,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> they can not benefit from the possibilities cooperation would offer them.
</I>&gt;<i> So yes, if the tools wants to benefit, it needs to be able to migrate the 
</I>&gt;<i> data back and forth, but they will not neccessarily be eliminated ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   B. Non-compliant documents may implement other, rival solutions.  So
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      fragmentation is *not* solved by your solution alone.  You depend
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      on the existence of other solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's how it works today.
</I>&gt;<i> There are dozen of tools around that all implement their own proprietary 
</I>&gt;<i> standards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you prefer A, then your approach to the larger problem is at odds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with and incompatible with what we propose in this thread. **   If you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prefer B, then it is compatible.  Which do you prefer, A or B?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would prefer A. But B is even a good starting point that's worth proving 
</I>&gt;<i> the goal of adding benefit to those who participate.
</I>&gt;<i> If B fail, A will fail also.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Your solution is not entirely new, ofc.  Mark Murphy proposed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      something similar in 2007.  xDebate formats (not yet published)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      is a Semantic HTML (POSH) schemata for federated debate on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      political issues.  We discussed it with him in 2009.  See:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-February/001195.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-February/001195.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      The broader context of that discussion was his 2008 essay in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      Rebooting America: The &quot;killer app&quot; of public participation:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      <A HREF="http://rebooting.personaldemocracy.com/node/5499">http://rebooting.personaldemocracy.com/node/5499</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are right. There is already a lot out there! We need to connect even 
</I>&gt;<i> more ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      Later in 2009, Thomas was chasing the fragmentation problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      himself and uncovered a different solution, one that nobody ever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      thought of before.  Vote mirroring works on documents (and other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      objects) via their popular support, not their content.  But note:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   ** All we propose is a neutral tool switch that is blind to specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      solutions.  Like the Internet, it is open to all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For me B provides the most benefit to the developers and providers of 
</I>&gt;<i> specific tools and solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> And A provides the most benefit to the users and content contributors of the 
</I>&gt;<i> tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What audience would you like to attract?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
