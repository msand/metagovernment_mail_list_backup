<PRE>Hi Ed,

I think that we, here in representative systems, are far away from anything that can be called rightfully a &#8220;democracy&#8221; (they are in fact particracies  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particracy</A> ). Therefore a lot of us are working very hard to evolve to something better.

We can:
- Propose something theoretically better. (metagovernment or a few hunderd or more philosophies and experiments)
- Propose to evolve to a system that has a proven record of more than 100 years in his current form with a lot of comparative studies all over the world: direct democracy.

Of course the second option does not exclude the search for improvements.

<A HREF="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~matsusak/Papers/Matsusaka_DD_PC_Encyclopedia.pdf">http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~matsusak/Papers/Matsusaka_DD_PC_Encyclopedia.pdf</A>
..............
For example, the best available evidence indicates that over
70 percent of American citizens currently have the initiative available to them at either
the state or local level (Matsusaka, 2002). If referendums, town meetings, and county
initiatives were included, the fraction of people with some access to direct democracy
would be even higher. Outside the United States, Switzerland, Italy, and Australia have
made use of direct democracy for decades, and virtually all countries have held national
referendums at one point or another to decide important issues. The institutions of direct
democracy have even spread to former Soviet Union: at least 6 of its 15 successor states
have incorporated the initiative in their new constitutions.
..........
I personally think democracy need to be approached as an evolution in steps. We, ourselves, are also in a constant evolution, therefore it is normal that governing systems has to evolve to. No system is perfect (and never will be) and every step to a &#8220;better&#8221; solution has to been taken, studied, evaluated and respected and then we can move on to the next step. And maybe the next step is a good one but it can be a wrong one to. As long as the people decide for themselves this is no problem. Then they step back.
Our representative at the Global forum on modern direct democracy (in 2010) <A HREF="http://2012globalforum.com/">http://2012globalforum.com/</A> has met there a lot of people thinking and working on improvements on the system of direct democracy (Oregon, California,....). But in a direct democracy it is possible for the people themselves to decide to change the system, in a representative system we can&#8217;t. The people in Switzerland (an &#8220;indirect&#8221; direct democracy) introduced the &#8220;double majority&#8221; system and used that system to approve a secession. (Some municipalities in the canton Bern asked and got a secession and formed the new canton Jura).  
The spontaneous reactions you are mentioning against direct democracy are always the same and are easily contradicted if you want to. Just as the remark that consensus it the tyranny of the few. 

Therefore I think it is better to try to work together with all the people who are in a positive way trying to evolve to a better political system without  repeating the counter arguments of opponents to democracy. You still have to prove that you can do better, and until then it seems to me not wise to take up a fight on all fronts. Maybe you could take the time to study also the counter arguments we present. (chapter 6 from page 68 on <A HREF="http://www.democracy-international.org/index.php?eID=tx_nawsecuredl&amp;u=0&amp;file=fileadmin/pdfarchiv/di/verhulst-nijeboer-direct-democracy-en.pdf&amp;t=1353408289&amp;hash=9413c73215db1c534c8acadc8203e815bf76aa52">http://www.democracy-international.org/index.php?eID=tx_nawsecuredl&amp;u=0&amp;file=fileadmin/pdfarchiv/di/verhulst-nijeboer-direct-democracy-en.pdf&amp;t=1353408289&amp;hash=9413c73215db1c534c8acadc8203e815bf76aa52</A> )
That is why I was also active in Participedia  <A HREF="http://participedia.net/">http://participedia.net/</A> , an open global knowledge community for researchers and practitioners in the field of democratic innovation and public engagement. (you made yourself an entry there for Metagovernment). Everybody can see there that there are a lot of practical experiments going on while new ideas are developed, also consensus type of experiments.
I am also a founding member of democracy international and we published a book in 8 languages (the English one is mentioned above)
<A HREF="http://www.democracy-international.org/book-direct-democracy.html">http://www.democracy-international.org/book-direct-democracy.html</A>
Together with our sister organisation IRI  <A HREF="http://www.iri-europe.org/publications/guidebooks/">http://www.iri-europe.org/publications/guidebooks/</A> we developed the direct democracy navigator <A HREF="http://direct-democracy-navigator.org/">http://direct-democracy-navigator.org/</A>
Here in Belgium we have a saying: Don&#8217;t throw away your old shoes before the new ones has proved to be better.
And I would add: and if you do, don&#8217;t throw them in the face of people who are still on bare foots. 
so, lets try to work together on any idea for improvement without joining the forces who opposes an evolution towards &#8220;more democracy&#8221; (a lot of studies conducted by universities all over the world  are showing that when comparing representative systems with direct democracies,  then the direct democracies are showing a far better result over all in representing the wishes of the majority of the people) 
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Many-Few-Initiative-Democracy-Political/dp/0226510816">http://www.amazon.com/Many-Few-Initiative-Democracy-Political/dp/0226510816</A>
<A HREF="http://www.c2d.ch/">http://www.c2d.ch/</A>  and so on.
Maybe a good question to people living in direct democracies would be: do you want to go back to a purely representative system? (There is, to my knowledge, only one example where people chose, by popular referendum, to give more power back to their monarchy, Liechtenstein 2003  <A HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18649156,">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18649156,</A> but they can take the power back if they want to)
For the moment I don&#8217;t see any evolution in the &#8220;majority system&#8221; in direct democracies (except for the Swiss double majority) to anything else, even when they can do it, if they want to. 
As far as I am concerned, Metagovernment is thinking about a system that might avoid some of the remarks made against direct democracy.
That is why I was in support of Metagovernment.
Kind Regards
Paul

Hi, Paul. 

Almost every single conversation I have with anyone about Metagovernment is very quickly met with the reaction: &quot;well, that's just mob rule.&quot; At least in the U.S., people very tightly associate democracy with majority-rule and direct democracy with tyranny of the majority and demagoguery. 

That sort of reaction is what lead me down the path of consensus-through-synthesis in the first place. To avoid the pitfalls of at least what people perceive as limitations of traditional forms of direct democracy.

Again, I have the U.S. as my main source of personal information, but when we use direct democracy here (&quot;ballot initiatives&quot; or referenda), it is not at all uncommon to see these pitfalls come to life. When people are given a rare opportunity to vote-by-majority on a highly-publicized, controversial topic, it is no wonder that demagoguery is possible... and thus, basically, mob rule.

The Metagov site isn't meant to insult proponents of direct democracy (since we are advocating a form of it ourselves). But some of us (at least I) have a problem with some forms of direct democracy because of the problems above. If you think we could make this statement better, please make a suggestion as Alexander suggests. The Metagov site, and particularly the home page, is built by consensus. You are breaking the consensus, so we need your help to re-build it, please.

Thanks!

  Metagovernment's solutions are collaborative, consensus-based, and synthesis-oriented. In this way, we avoid the traditional limitations of direct democracy and allow everyone to be involved without degrading into mob rule, tyranny of the majority, or demagoguery. 

  Kind regards

  Hey, looks great - I still dont have any clue of how this toolbar works, but it feels like progress and thats a good thing.

  I mean, i dont understand the workflow, but its fun clicking around :-)

    Thomas and Ed,

    Hey guys, I went ahead and did step (a) in the wiki.  Just so it's
    easier to see what we're talking about.


    Ed said:
    &gt; I don't think I have any objections, though I'm still unclear on

    &gt; what is involved in step a. ...

    Here's how it looks in the wiki:
    <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page</A>

      (may need to hit refresh)

    You shouldn't see anything on IE.  On Firefox and Chrome (possibly
    others) you should see a black toolbar at top.  You'll see it on every
    page.  (Don't worry about how to use it yet, that's not the point. ;^)

    &gt; ... Does it take the form of additions to the existing Metagov wiki?

    To do this, I made the following changes:
    <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=MediaWiki:Common.css&amp;curid=331&amp;diff=3541&amp;oldid=3364">http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=MediaWiki:Common.css&amp;curid=331&amp;diff=3541&amp;oldid=3364</A>
    <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=MediaWiki:Common.js&amp;curid=449&amp;diff=3544&amp;oldid=3458">http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=MediaWiki:Common.js&amp;curid=449&amp;diff=3544&amp;oldid=3458</A>


    &gt; And if so, where would the &quot;switch&quot; appear? In the User Preferences?


    The switch design was supposed to come in step (c).  Meantime it's a
    null switch with a single position, Votorola.  That'll be a problem
    for some folks (rightfully), so we might be forced to hack together a
    switch earlier.  And maybe it could help us with step (b).


      (b) We make it known that we want other projects to do the same.  If
          they do not have software with this capability, they can either
          copy ours (we'll help them), or build their own.


    Suppose the switch had two positions instead of one: (0) banner ad,
    and (1) Votorola.  Not sure exactly what would go on the banner ad,
    but somehow it would do the job of (b).  And (0) would be the default
    position, ofc.

    If the switch UI (dial or whatever) were close to the switched views
    (banner ad, toolsets), then the user could change toolsets on the fly.
    Maybe the ad could even invite the user to operate the switch and see
    what's on offer.  Should we look into a quick design for this?


    &gt; Also, what do you need from me to deploy?


    To do the same with the list archive, we might use something like
    Apache Substitute.  We'd need info about the host web server:

      * Is it Apache?

      * Does it support mod_substitute, mod_sed, or mod_line_edit?

      * Where in the file system is Mailman's public archive directory
        (mailman/archives/public/) that Apache serves?
        <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node10.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node10.html</A>

      * How do we configure the service of that directory?  Via central
        config files, as here for example?
        <A HREF="http://havoc.zelea.com/system/host/havoc/etc/apache2/modules.d/50_mailman.conf">http://havoc.zelea.com/system/host/havoc/etc/apache2/modules.d/50_mailman.conf</A>

        Or via a .htaccess file in the directory itself?

    Meantime, I can look into what's involved in migrating to TuxFamily.
    Is this the latest information on that?
    <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Upgrade_backlog#TuxFamily_Migration">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Upgrade_backlog#TuxFamily_Migration</A>

    &gt; &gt; Ok, I didn't know, that it is so easy to reverse.
