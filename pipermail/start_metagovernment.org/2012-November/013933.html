<PRE>Hi Ed,

&gt;<i> I think I really like this idea, though I don't 100% understand
</I>&gt;<i> it. Michael, I'll try to provide my own answers to Mark's and
</I>&gt;<i> Ronald's objections, and you please tell me if I got it right. :)
</I>
I think so.  Ronald states his concern in terms of disconnected
practices (an effect), rather than disconnected tools (a cause).  But
showcasing the tools side-by-side seems a good first step to solving
the problem all round, just as you say.

Also it's true, we aren't proposing a foundation like Mark is.  The
tools don't depend on the switch.  They don't rest on it and they
don't need to be reshaped for compliance.  The community might impose
restrictions by administrative means, but they wouldn't be cast in
technical concrete.  So it isn't anything like a foundation.

&gt;<i> Michael, what would be involved in firing this up, and do you think
</I>&gt;<i> this would be a good time to finally move the Metagov site off my
</I>&gt;<i> own hosted site and onto the latent Tuxfamily site we have waiting
</I>&gt;<i> for us? (Currently resting at <A HREF="http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org">http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but the domain can certainly move there.)
</I>
I guess the port to TuxFamily would have to go piecewise.  We might
hit snags along the way, and there could be delays.  So we'd probably
want to push the two efforts (port and framework) on parallel tracks.
I could help with the port.

On the framework side, assuming we agree to these proposed steps:

  (a) We deploy the main user interface of Votorola in Metagov web
      pages, including the wiki pages and the mailing list archive.

  (b) We make it known that we want other projects to do the same.  If
      they do not have software with this capability, they can either
      copy ours (we'll help them), or build their own.

  (c) Together with the second project that joins, we develop a
      neutral tool switch.

Step (a) could be done immediately for the wiki.  For the mailing
list, maybe a few days if the host provides Apache mod_substitute.
Otherwise might be longer.

Step (b) isn't clear yet.  Step (a) would provide a concrete example
of what we're offering in terms of a showcase, but somehow we'd have
to make the offer explicit.

Step (c) would go quickly once we have a second project.  A basic
switch shouldn't take more than 3 weeks to design and code.

</I>&gt;<i> Mark, I don't think Michael's offering a technological foundation as much as a showcase. At this stage, he's not suggesting a strong linkage between projects, but rather a way for people to &quot;shop&quot; them and see how different ones perform in different scenarios. As part of that, he's also not suggesting Votorola be a foundation but rather just one of those showcased tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ronald, I think Michael's approach is not perfect, but compare it to the present, where we have tools scattered all over the net with no real basis for comparison. If you want to explore several, you need to invest a lot of time and effort, and your comparison will ultimately be apples to oranges, since the tools are running in such different ways. Michael's proposal provides a much easier way to look at tools, and it also provides an imperfect but excellent start toward some deeper level of harmony.
