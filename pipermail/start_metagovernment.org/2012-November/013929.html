<PRE>I think I really like this idea, though I don't 100% understand it. Michael, I'll try to provide my own answers to Mark's and Ronal's objections, and you please tell me if I got it right. :)

Mark, I don't think Michael's offering a technological foundation as much as a showcase. At this stage, he's not suggesting a strong linkage between projects, but rather a way for people to &quot;shop&quot; them and see how different ones perform in different scenarios. As part of that, he's also not suggesting Votorola be a foundation but rather just one of those showcased tools.

Ronald, I think Michael's approach is not perfect, but compare it to the present, where we have tools scattered all over the net with no real basis for comparison. If you want to explore several, you need to invest a lot of time and effort, and your comparison will ultimately be apples to oranges, since the tools are running in such different ways. Michael's proposal provides a much easier way to look at tools, and it also provides an imperfect but excellent start toward some deeper level of harmony.

Michael, what would be involved in firing this up, and do you think this would be a good time to finally move the Metagov site off my own hosted site and onto the latent Tuxfamily site we have waiting for us? (Currently resting at <A HREF="http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org">http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org</A> but the domain can certainly move there.)

</I>&gt;<i> Our goals are smaller than yours, so (at first blush) they're hard to
</I>&gt;<i> compare.  From the original post:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  a) We lower the barrier to cooperation among technical projects.
</I>&gt;<i>     The initial cooperation we expect is not vote mirroring, but
</I>&gt;<i>     simply the development of a tool switch that enables shared
</I>&gt;<i>     exposure of tools on Metagov.  Our experience tells us this can
</I>&gt;<i>     be hacked together in a matter of weeks, if not days.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  b) We get exposure on Metagov for Votorola.  Metagov is neutral
</I>&gt;<i>     ground and it attracts higher traffic than our own sites.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  c) We get exposure for the idea of cross-project cooperation for
</I>&gt;<i>     the sake of healthy competition as opposed to winner-take-all
</I>&gt;<i>     brutality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's also not clear to me what Votorola does and why you're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggesting it serve this purpose.  My recollection of Votorola from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several years ago is that it's a sophisticated system of delegated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting... though following the links to the cross-forum theater,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc. I don't see that system in practice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Recall we propose a tool switch that allows each Metagov participant
</I>&gt;<i> to choose which project's toolset to run on Metagov pages.  Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> would be one of the toolsets they could choose.  (They wouldn't know
</I>&gt;<i> how it works at first, but they'd have a chance to learn.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So perhaps I just need a remedial explanation of what you're hoping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to accomplish and why in order to provide a more informed response.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not at all certain I've understood your intent correctly. I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure it's my fault for not having paid close enough attention to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussions on the list for a bit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I often have trouble understanding other projects, too.  That's one of
</I>&gt;<i> the reasons I value Metagov so much.  It's neutral ground where we can
</I>&gt;<i> speak on a level, as peers, and get to know each other.  I can't think
</I>&gt;<i> of any place like it.  It'd be so cool if we could extend that kind of
</I>&gt;<i> easy communication to our tools.  Wouldn't it?
