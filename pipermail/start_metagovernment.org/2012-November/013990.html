<PRE>Alex and Ed,

&gt;<i> Wow :-) New stuff in the toolbar and other stuff happens when i
</I>&gt;<i> mouseover things...  Something is happening. All the stuff i saw in
</I>&gt;<i> the past is being put together :-) Feels very exicting.
</I>
:<i>-) The new addition is Conseo's talk track (squares aligned right).
</I>It's still only a skeleton.  We're still mooting how to flesh it out.
See: <A HREF="http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/2012-November/001533.html">http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/2012-November/001533.html</A>
(more on that below)

&gt;<i> Well of course you like it, i't just a modification of an earlier
</I>&gt;<i> draft of yours. :)
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2&amp;action=history">http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2&amp;action=history</A>
</I>
But it's the right size at this juncture.  That's what attracts me,
not the content.  We have no real agreement on the content.  A small
document is therefore more honest.  It confesses its shortcomings.
Maybe we should confess ours, too.  How about this for a homepage?

   We're learning to reach agreement and mutual understanding with our
   fellows, because our parents never taught us.

I feel that's the truth.

&gt;<i> It is an interesting idea, though... boiling the entire concept down
</I>&gt;<i> to one sentence. But I think I'd like to change it slightly. Since
</I>&gt;<i> we're &quot;skinning&quot; votorola here at the same time, would I do that in
</I>&gt;<i> the current draft or start a new one?
</I>
In the current one.  Or you could just paste the content here for now.

Generally, I think we should do what comes naturally and not worry
about the tools.  Let them catch up on their own time.  They're even
more messed up than we are, because we're their teachers. ;^)

&gt;<i> Also, you Votorola folks might want to take this opportunity to walk
</I>&gt;<i> us through the interface. I see a lot of navigation available from
</I>&gt;<i> my draft, but I get a little lost/confused as I click around. Is
</I>&gt;<i> there a key to the buttons/symbols in the top bar?
</I>
For a newcomer who stumbles on it?  We're aiming to reward exploration
long enough to get across a two-fold message:

 (1) What you see (whatever's on the page) is being discussed.
 (2) You can join the discussion.  It's happening here ---&gt;

We haven't got there yet.  But from there, it'll be a job for people.
If the tools are useful to folks who already understand them, then
those folks will take responsibility for newcomers.  That may entail
demanding further tool changes, but exactly what we don't know.

Or for us?  This post had a key of sorts:
<A HREF="http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/2012-September/001412.html">http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/2012-September/001412.html</A>
I update it below.  (need a fixed-width font to see this)

  poll
  |  place
  |  | talk
  |  | | vote
  |  | | |                                       toolset switch popper
                                                    _ __  /
  ^^ O Q X                                   P ][ D D ][ ^  link track
  --------------------------------------------------------  polltrack
  &lt;- ||||| - |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  geotrack
  --------------------------------------------------------  talk track
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --- &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --- &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  vote track

The geotrack isn't coded yet.  Another difference: I arrange the
top-left links in the same order as the corresponding tracks below.
As mooted in the post above, we're thinking we might use tactile
lighting effects between the two to give the user a sense of what each
track is for.  Little things like that.

Since the aim is to funnel newcomers into the discussion (1,2), you
can see how Conseo's talk track will have to shine.  We don't quite
know how yet.  But the design of the Crossforum Theatre stage allows
us to experiment.  We'll get it right eventually.

I'm coding the plug-in toolset switch now (top right).  It's nearly
ready (maybe tonight or tomorrow).  I'm very grateful to Metagov for
making it possible!  We have no right to showcase Votorola here and
test its design etc. if we aren't equally open to other toolsets.

Thanks folks,

Mike
