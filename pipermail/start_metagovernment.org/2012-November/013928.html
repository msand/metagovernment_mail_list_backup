<PRE>Mark Frischmuth said:
&gt;<i> My best understanding of your intent is that it's the same as what
</I>&gt;<i> we're working towards with the ODDI group - to create an open source
</I>&gt;<i> foundation that numerous online engagement platforms can be built on
</I>&gt;<i> top of, offering open standards and interoperable data.  Is this
</I>&gt;<i> right, or is there another purpose I'm not understanding?
</I>
Our goals are smaller than yours, so (at first blush) they're hard to
compare.  From the original post:

  a) We lower the barrier to cooperation among technical projects.
     The initial cooperation we expect is not vote mirroring, but
     simply the development of a tool switch that enables shared
     exposure of tools on Metagov.  Our experience tells us this can
     be hacked together in a matter of weeks, if not days.

  b) We get exposure on Metagov for Votorola.  Metagov is neutral
     ground and it attracts higher traffic than our own sites.

  c) We get exposure for the idea of cross-project cooperation for
     the sake of healthy competition as opposed to winner-take-all
     brutality.

&gt;<i> It's also not clear to me what Votorola does and why you're
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting it serve this purpose.  My recollection of Votorola from
</I>&gt;<i> several years ago is that it's a sophisticated system of delegated
</I>&gt;<i> voting... though following the links to the cross-forum theater,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. I don't see that system in practice.
</I>
Recall we propose a tool switch that allows each Metagov participant
to choose which project's toolset to run on Metagov pages.  Votorola
would be one of the toolsets they could choose.  (They wouldn't know
how it works at first, but they'd have a chance to learn.)

&gt;<i> So perhaps I just need a remedial explanation of what you're hoping
</I>&gt;<i> to accomplish and why in order to provide a more informed response.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not at all certain I've understood your intent correctly. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure it's my fault for not having paid close enough attention to
</I>&gt;<i> discussions on the list for a bit.
</I>
I often have trouble understanding other projects, too.  That's one of
the reasons I value Metagov so much.  It's neutral ground where we can
speak on a level, as peers, and get to know each other.  I can't think
of any place like it.  It'd be so cool if we could extend that kind of
easy communication to our tools.  Wouldn't it?

Mike
