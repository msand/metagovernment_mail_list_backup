<PRE>Hi Thomas,

Thank you for clarifying. Indeed I misunderstood what your tool switch 
proposal is about.

I did not recognize the communication between the tools.
So it's even better than I thought before.

Unfortunately in your (Thomas') example, there is a Chinese whispers effect 
embedded that, if projected on the tools, is a big problem I think. 
Information can easily get lost and is completly hidden from the others. 
Esperanto would solve this problem, but indeed introduce new ones, as you 
already mentioned.

All in all I still think B is 'just' a step towards A.
But that's a great starting-point, and I am very curious how it will evolve.

@Mike:
&gt;&gt;<i> What audience would you like to attract?
</I>&gt;<i> I would first ask you to clarify how A could benefit users (or anyone)
</I>&gt;<i> more than B. (But here too, I think it was just a miscommunication.)
</I>
The benefit of A for users and content contributors is that there will be no 
information and content loss any more.
The data is just there and can be processed by any tool, not just by the one 
the data was entered to.

The drawback of B is that there is still data loss. If not, we have reached 
A ;o)

So from my side a full ack to go towards B - it seems to be on my path 
towards A anyway ;o)

Cheers
marc

Hey guys,

I too believe, you are misunderstanding each other.

In the end, we all want all the tools to communicate with each other.

We just differ in the ways to achieve that goal. Let me use an example:
The Chinese, the Americans and the Germans want to find an agreement.

Solution A: everybody has to learn Esperanto, otherwise he can not take
part in the negotiations.

Solution B: we findout one Chinese speaks English alreadyand oneAmerican
speaks German. And that is actually already enough! We all can
communicate with each other through them. Puhh! Lucky us, nobody needs
to learn Esperanto! ;-)

With B we can start right away. No need to wait until everybody agrees
on the language to be used. Wesimply find two tools which are willing to
communicate and they work out the easiest language for them (and here
the work, i.e. definitions, models etc. of AG Meinungsfindungstool come
into play and can be used).

The proposed tool-switch for Metagov would be the conference room, where
everybody is invited to comeand take a seat.Nobody will be forced to
communicate, but I believe some will want to. :-)


Greetings,
Thomas

</I>&gt;<i> that solution alone.  So the outcome must be B:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> B. Non-compliant documents may implement other, rival solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     So fragmentation is *not* solved by your solution alone.  You
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     depend on the existence of other solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's how it works today.  There are dozen of tools around that all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implement their own proprietary standards.
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I speak of a future in which the problem is solved.  Although
</I>&gt;<i> there exist today *proposed* solutions (such as xDebate formats,
</I>&gt;<i> Outcast, Meinungsfindungstool and ODDI), we can hardly find any
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of them.  There are maybe 2 or 3 tools compliant with
</I>&gt;<i> one solution or another, not dozens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the problem is still unsolved.  We have yet to arrive at future A
</I>&gt;<i> or B and are still free to choose between them.  What we (Conseo,
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas and I) propose is a step toward future B.  Our proposed tool
</I>&gt;<i> switch will not prefer any particular solution (xDebate, Outcast,
</I>&gt;<i> Meinungsfindungstool, ODDI, etc) over another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would prefer A. But B is even a good starting point that's worth
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proving the goal of adding benefit to those who participate.  If B
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fail, A will fail also.
</I>&gt;<i> Your preference (again) may be based on a miscommunication.  But if
</I>&gt;<i> you agree that a step toward B would be a good start, then all we
</I>&gt;<i> propose here is a mechanism for that first step.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For me B provides the most benefit to the developers and providers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of specific tools and solutions.  And A provides the most benefit to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the users and content contributors of the tools.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This sounds like &quot;defragmented&quot; tools to me.  It's an example of that.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The tools are no longer disconnected fragments because they share two

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;consolidated overview&quot; into which they are pushed or pulled. *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's true. At the end our working group proposes a standardized meta

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> schema to interchange data between different solutions or tools. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is not a &quot;consolidated overview&quot; but defined interfaces that can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> queried by the tool A on tool B to retrieve specific data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think we both agree (and Marc agrees) that the tools must somehow
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (in this meaning) be defragmented.  You offer a specific solution,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> while we (Conseo, Thomas and I) do not.  This raises the question of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> how your solution relates to what we're proposing in this thread.  The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> answer hinges on how you address the problem of fragmented documents
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that are *non-compliant* with your agreed meta-data standard.  Either:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    A. All documents must implement the agreed meta-data standard.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       Non-compliant documents are eliminated.  So fragmentation is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       solved by your solution alone.  Or,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they can not benefit from the possibilities cooperation would offer them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So yes, if the tools wants to benefit, it needs to be able to migrate the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data back and forth, but they will not neccessarily be eliminated ;o)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    B. Non-compliant documents may implement other, rival solutions.  So
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       fragmentation is *not* solved by your solution alone.  You depend
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       on the existence of other solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's how it works today.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are dozen of tools around that all implement their own proprietary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standards.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you prefer A, then your approach to the larger problem is at odds
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with and incompatible with what we propose in this thread. **   If you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prefer B, then it is compatible.  Which do you prefer, A or B?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would prefer A. But B is even a good starting point that's worth 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the goal of adding benefit to those who participate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If B fail, A will fail also.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     * Your solution is not entirely new, ofc.  Mark Murphy proposed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       something similar in 2007.  xDebate formats (not yet published)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       is a Semantic HTML (POSH) schemata for federated debate on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       political issues.  We discussed it with him in 2009.  See:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-February/001195.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-February/001195.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       The broader context of that discussion was his 2008 essay in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       Rebooting America: The &quot;killer app&quot; of public participation:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       <A HREF="http://rebooting.personaldemocracy.com/node/5499">http://rebooting.personaldemocracy.com/node/5499</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You are right. There is already a lot out there! We need to connect even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more ;o)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       Later in 2009, Thomas was chasing the fragmentation problem
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       himself and uncovered a different solution, one that nobody ever
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       thought of before.  Vote mirroring works on documents (and other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       objects) via their popular support, not their content.  But note:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    ** All we propose is a neutral tool switch that is blind to specific
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       solutions.  Like the Internet, it is open to all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For me B provides the most benefit to the developers and providers of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific tools and solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And A provides the most benefit to the users and content contributors of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tools.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What audience would you like to attract?
