<PRE>Thomas and Ed,

Hey guys, I went ahead and did step (a) in the wiki.  Just so it's
easier to see what we're talking about.

Ed said:
&gt;<i> I don't think I have any objections, though I'm still unclear on
</I>&gt;<i> what is involved in step a. ...
</I>
Here's how it looks in the wiki:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page</A>

  (may need to hit refresh)

You shouldn't see anything on IE.  On Firefox and Chrome (possibly
others) you should see a black toolbar at top.  You'll see it on every
page.  (Don't worry about how to use it yet, that's not the point. ;^)

&gt;<i> ... Does it take the form of additions to the existing Metagov wiki?
</I>
To do this, I made the following changes:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=MediaWiki:Common.css&amp;curid=331&amp;diff=3541&amp;oldid=3364">http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=MediaWiki:Common.css&amp;curid=331&amp;diff=3541&amp;oldid=3364</A>
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=MediaWiki:Common.js&amp;curid=449&amp;diff=3544&amp;oldid=3458">http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=MediaWiki:Common.js&amp;curid=449&amp;diff=3544&amp;oldid=3458</A>

&gt;<i> And if so, where would the &quot;switch&quot; appear? In the User Preferences?
</I>
The switch design was supposed to come in step (c).  Meantime it's a
null switch with a single position, Votorola.  That'll be a problem
for some folks (rightfully), so we might be forced to hack together a
switch earlier.  And maybe it could help us with step (b).

  (b) We make it known that we want other projects to do the same.  If
      they do not have software with this capability, they can either
      copy ours (we'll help them), or build their own.

Suppose the switch had two positions instead of one: (0) banner ad,
and (1) Votorola.  Not sure exactly what would go on the banner ad,
but somehow it would do the job of (b).  And (0) would be the default
position, ofc.

If the switch UI (dial or whatever) were close to the switched views
(banner ad, toolsets), then the user could change toolsets on the fly.
Maybe the ad could even invite the user to operate the switch and see
what's on offer.  Should we look into a quick design for this?

&gt;<i> Also, what do you need from me to deploy?
</I>
To do the same with the list archive, we might use something like
Apache Substitute.  We'd need info about the host web server:

  * Is it Apache?

  * Does it support mod_substitute, mod_sed, or mod_line_edit?

  * Where in the file system is Mailman's public archive directory
    (mailman/archives/public/) that Apache serves?
    <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node10.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-install/node10.html</A>

  * How do we configure the service of that directory?  Via central
    config files, as here for example?
    <A HREF="http://havoc.zelea.com/system/host/havoc/etc/apache2/modules.d/50_mailman.conf">http://havoc.zelea.com/system/host/havoc/etc/apache2/modules.d/50_mailman.conf</A>

    Or via a .htaccess file in the directory itself?

Meantime, I can look into what's involved in migrating to TuxFamily.
Is this the latest information on that?
