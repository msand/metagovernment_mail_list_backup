<PRE>hi all,
My proposal was a little bit to spontaneous. I looked at the pages (a worked 
a lot on them in the past) and I would like to rephrase the chalenge.
On the fractional reserve page the explanation now is wrong (and they know 
it).
The &quot;Money creation process&quot;  and the following explanations are the old 
theoretical explanations of what the financial sector likes us to believe.
Nevertheless, some &quot;classical&quot; economists have empirically proven that the 
system of money creation and reserves is not working like that in reality 
(Kydland &amp; Prescott, Business Cycles: Real Facts and a Monetary Myth, 
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review, Spring 1990, both of 
them are Nobel price winners in economy). 
<A HREF="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2009/01/31/therovingcavaliersofcredit/#_ftn3">http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2009/01/31/therovingcavaliersofcredit/#_ftn3</A> 
Their finding are confirmed by numerous senior bank officials, Public 
servants on top positions and so on. Easy to find.

The task is to give their findings (again) more attention in the original 
article &quot;fractional reserve&quot; page in Wikipedia and maintain it there for a 
couple of months.
Now it is moved to <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier</A> without any 
emphasis on the importance of those findings and references. That is their 
strategy. It is not removed completely but just hard to find for anyone new 
in the subject and with as less as possible references.

Good luck

Paul

hi all,

yes, Ed's draft looks good

Metagov is developing the public tools and practices to enable full and
meaningful participation in governance.

But the criticism on direct democracy is now shifted to the page
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance</A>

a criticism that is easily contradicted and I can't imagine that the Swiss
people and all the others in the US and elsewhere will agree that they are
living with a mob rule or a tyranny of the majority.

but if it makes you happy to join with the voices against direct democracy
just go non, happiness it what we are try to achieve

Maybe a good exercise for your proposal is to maintain a wikipedia page.
Something with some interest of &quot;special interest&quot; groups. Try &quot;fractional
reserve&quot; or something like that.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking</A> . Try to promote and
defend &quot;full reserve banking&quot;.
Just an excercise.

Paul

Thomas, Paul and Alex, Ed and Conseo,

Good idea, guys!  I agree the home page needs work.  Myself, I like
Ed's draft.  I think it's easier to understand and makes it easier to
discuss proposed changes.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2</A>

Paul Nollen said:
&gt;<i> I looked at the wiki and the procedures but for the moment it will
</I>&gt;<i> take to much of my time to find my way. ...
</I>
In that case, another way to participate is just to join in the
discussion.  For example, do you like Ed's draft?  Can you think of a
way to improve it?

Ed and Conseo, shouldn't it all be one paragraph?
<A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?a=5392&amp;b=5387&amp;aR=3547&amp;bR=3004">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?a=5392&amp;b=5387&amp;aR=3547&amp;bR=3004</A>

Doesn't it look better this way?
