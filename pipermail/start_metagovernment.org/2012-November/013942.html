<PRE>Hi,

I strongly agree with Ronald, that there should be a kind of 'standardized 
meta data' that all tools (plug-ins to the framework) are working on, or at 
least, are able to convert their data back and forth.

So what about eDialogus 
<A HREF="http://www.imc.com.gr/ontologies/eDialogos/consensus/#overview">http://www.imc.com.gr/ontologies/eDialogos/consensus/#overview</A>  as a 
starting point for a unique ontology for discussion systems?

What do you think?

Cheers
Merkbefreiter (marc)

P.S. Because there is already a 'Mark' on the list, you can safely refer to 
me as 'Merkbefreiter' ;o)

Hello Mike, &quot;So the documents (and popular support) cannot be defragmented 
without defragmenting the tools.&quot; No, not necessarily. This is my proposal, 
how to outbalance the fragmentation of documents: We agree on a set of meta 
data, that the tools should support per document, for instance: UID Title 
Document Type Document Status Area Topic Owner URL [where to find the 
document] (Author) (Keywords) UID is a unique ID, to be able to unmistakably 
identify the document. Attributes in brackets () would be optional. The 
possible entries for &quot;Document Type&quot; and &quot;Document Status&quot; would be 
pre-defined. The possible entries for &quot;Area&quot; and &quot;Topic&quot; should be fed by a 
common database (editable by everyone), to avoid &quot;fragmentation by naming&quot;. 
To consolidate the data to an overview on the documents there are two 
solution I can think of: 1. All tools report their documents to a central 
server, that provides an overview of all documents, by calling a common 
interface. (e.g. a http-request) 2. A search tool that crawls through all 
tools and collects the data. This solution has, at first glance three 
downsides: - The tools must be searchable (like a web page). - The documents 
must provide the meta data proposed above as standardized meta-tags. - The 
tools will be loaded with requests, every time a search is triggered. The 
consolidation of supporting votes could work the same, but is a more touchy 
matter, as this is a potential field for cheating and therefore requires 
special measures to ensure trust.

Best Regards
Ronald

Ronald Grindle said:  I think you got me wrong on my Statement &quot;The same 
applies to the question about the numbers of supporters...&quot;. It's also 
concerning the documents, not the tools used. That was my understanding, 
too. But the fragmentation of documents and their popular support is caused 
by the fragmentation of tools. Right? It's here in your example:  An example 
for scattering and fragmentation: Let's assume we have 3 different tools 
plugged into Metagov and let's assume there a discussion going on how to 
establish &quot;Peace on Earth&quot;. Unless the contents (documents) on this topic in 
these 3 tools [are] synchronized to a common view at some central point it's 
up to the user to find out what documents are available and what the current 
state on the topic is (I call this phenomenon &quot;Searching instead of 
Finding&quot;). So the documents (and popular support) cannot be defragmented 
without defragmenting the tools. There are two approaches to that that 
differ in the up-front principles they enshrine: A. Simplification and 
standardization (then restricted choice) 
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-October/005111.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-October/005111.html</A> 
B. Equality and freedom of choice (then ad hoc inter-communication) 
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-October/005114.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-October/005114.html</A> 
We propose a mechanism for B. We rig Metagov as a plug-in framework with a 
neutral tool switch. Mike _______________________________________________
