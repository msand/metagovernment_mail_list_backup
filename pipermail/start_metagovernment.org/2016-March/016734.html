<PRE>Hi Jacopo,

thank you for your interest. At the moment, I am renting a flat in Pohorsk&#225;
Ves in the southeast part of Czech Republic on borders with Austria. The
event took place at the local pub (there is just one).

Two weeks before the event the local mayor invented a theory that I will
sell pots and pans there. I was trying to explain to him but he was still
suspicious. Also, the local official cultural worker was offended that I
dare to have such an event contrary to her opposition. After that, an
anonymous plot came to me that I am insurance seller, journalist, that I
came to oppose local mayor. At the event, my theoretical knowledge was
questioned by a local teacher (mayor's son) and I was told that I do not
understand local conditions and that local officials are doing good work.
Everything contrary to the fact everybody got invitation with this link
<A HREF="http://spobu.github.io/">http://spobu.github.io/</A>
the last link is &quot;author&quot; ,about me.
I have made a lot of mistakes and I will try to avoid them next time. I
will choose some bigger place with a better mayor, get some verifiable
public identity (some visible job), better internet domain name, better
invitation order, more publicity,... and I think it will work.

Local egalitarians (not authoritarians or their followers) liked the
process and were contacting me privately, but most of them were afraid to
come because the local mayor has great power here. He has a major influence
on jobs, flats and land here.

Just a few people came, almost half of them to oppose me not much willing
to do anything else, still they went through the survey with me. The
another half were my volunteers from local ethnic minority used to
difficult life in a xenophobic country.

Contrary to all of this there was no complaint about the methodology itself
and it was accepted as a fair and efficient way of constructing the local
public opinion. Just the participants were missing.

Well, it happens, I am still learning.

How is Airesis going?

Cheers
m.
