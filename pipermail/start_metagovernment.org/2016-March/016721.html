Problem is, power is put to far away at *all* scales, not just local.
There are a great many decisions that need to be made collectively at
each of these scales, up to and including the human species as a
whole. IMHO it's a mistake just to focus on solutions that only work
at one scale: The same system needs to be able to work at the
neighborhood level (for deciding on something like whether to repave a
street and how much to spend on that) on up to the global scale (like
deciding what our policy on abortion is going to be).

&gt;<i> Personally, for example, I like the idea of the world moving closer together

</I>&gt;<i> as possible. The way they are formed is kind of the anti-thesis of how

</I>&gt;<i> communities in a way, that allows their self governance without the risk of
</I>&gt;<i> being played out by actors who act on inter-group-levels.
</I>
I'd counter that these &quot;actors&quot; should be *everyone*, not that we
eliminate that role. There *does* need to be one single global trade
policy. The problem is merely that you and I don't get a say in how
it's developed, not the fact that it exists...

&gt;<i> In order to participate and be empowered, people need to learn programming
</I>&gt;<i> themselves - even if it's only to being able to judge what code others
</I>&gt;<i> propose to them.
</I>&gt;<i> (It was a revolution when people could for the first time read the bible
</I>&gt;<i> themselves instead of relying on some elite to translate and interpret it to
</I>&gt;<i> them)
</I>
I believe you're overselling the need for coding: The problem is
merely that people don't have access to the *data* they need, not that
they lack the ability to develop the tools to present and manipulate
that data. We only need small numbers of people actually doing the
coding to build the tools to do these things, but *everyone* needs
access to the data that the tools will access. If you don't like a
tool, you can of course learn programming to replace or improve it,
but the important thing is that *all* the data is available to the
public, not just the subset (and the tools to view it) that our
current leadership deems it necessary to provide us access to.

I also think you're taking the wrong lesson from the Gutenberg Bible:
If you've ever read the whole thing (as I have), you'll understand why
so few people have actually done so: I'd estimate the percentage as
being a small fraction of 1% of the population, even of so-called
&quot;Christians&quot;. Expecting everyone to code I consider to be about as
reasonable as expecting everyone to read the entire Bible. It just
isn't going to happen, and furthermore simply isn't a very efficient
use of their time. There is a role for experts in all of these
domains, we just need to make sure that we have the power to over-ride
them and access to all the information we'd need to responsibly do so.
  Regards,
    Scott
