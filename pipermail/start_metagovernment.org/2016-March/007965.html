My apologies for missing this discussion! At the time this project started
we were camping at Big Bend (Texas) where not there is not even any cell
phone service, let alone decent internet, and it's taken me this long to
catch up with the stuff that happened while we were gone that month.

But to take a stab at answering some of the issues raised:

1) The point of Matchism is to *find* the social/political/economic systems
that best fit humans at a given level of technological/informational
development. Some of the proposed measures of &quot;fit&quot; Ned supplied might be
useful, but only with the recognition that even those measures are only
appropriate for our *current* level of development. As soon as we learn
something, we have to evaluate whether those measures are even the
appropriate ones to use. In particular, I consider the idea that ecological
or &quot;well being&quot; measurements are the best we can do are carrying a huge
assumption that those are the things that *should* really matter to humans.
Maybe what best matches human nature and our current level of knowledge
(i.e., our current technology) is really to revert to small bands and
replace or just abandon some of our technology, or maybe what is best for
us is that we really should all be living on space stations where the
weather can be controlled. Measuring &quot;desertification&quot; or fisheries health
is irrelevant if either of those two is the appropriate next stage in our
social/political/economic development.

2) The &quot;tenets of Matchism&quot; are indeed just empirical findings, not
prescriptions. As with any engineering project, these are (some of) the
constraints that must be taken into account during the design process. They
are not prescriptions for how things should be so much as they are
constraints that are being violated in our current systems.

3) I think neither of these things are where the weaknesses in the current
version of the manifesto on matchism.org are: Certainly there are holes in
the social engineering stuff (mostly because there really *is* no field of
social engineering yet), but where the real gaps are, and what I'm mostly
working on now, are in the list of Clinations and the methods by which we
assign positive or negative valances to them. These seem to me now to be
the foundation upon which the field of social engineering will be built.
And while some sort of &quot;well being&quot; measurement might be part of how we
assess these things, my current thinking is that a more basic measurement
of stress levels might be more appropriate. For example we might measure
stress levels of all individuals in an experiment where they have to
function in a highly tribalistic system and compare that with their levels
in a system designed to prevent those sorts of alliances from forming:
Based on their relative performance and stress levels, we can then
reasonably *choose* whether our systems should allow for tribalism, or
actively suppress it.
  Regards,
    Scott
