<PRE>Hi,

also, a few days ago I tested my decision-making design. Approximately this
 <A HREF="http://participedia.net/en/methods/parties-global-agora">http://participedia.net/en/methods/parties-global-agora</A>

It is really powerful and can produce a lot of good decisions, educate and
even have fun when doing so. It was very cheap for me, $30, including beer
for poor.
Unfortunately, my action was undermined by an authoritarian mayor and his
followers. This place is the most autocratic I have ever been, so I will
try it at another place.

Anyway, it was just an experiment, the strategy is top-down (from global to
local - unusual for neighbourhoods). I hope for a virtual network of
&quot;messengers&quot;. First neighbourhoods' messengers will be chosen by chance*,
but later gradually exchanged for elected messengers sending deliberatively
directly democratically created messages.

*not entirely by chance - english speaking, people without power (mostly no
officials, no management, no journalists, no academics,...)

Well, do you know somebody who is working on something similar?

Cheers
m.
