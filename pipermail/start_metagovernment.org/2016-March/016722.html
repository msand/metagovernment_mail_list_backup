Not from me, all I'm going to be able to come up with are
counterexamples. Another one is that new &quot;cult&quot; starting up in New
Hampshire:
<A HREF="https://freestateproject.org/">https://freestateproject.org/</A>

To my thinking, this is exactly the opposite of what we should be
doing. Even if it works (and in this case I predict spectacular
failure, unlike most commune-type projects which usually just
gradually decay into oblivion) it doesn't provide us any useful
information about how to structure a government that works for all of
us. The problem isn't liberals or conservatives or any other
particular personality type, it's that some personality types
(particularly SDAPs) are attracted to leadership roles and that
existing types of government actually solidify and amplify this power
once they assume it. Job one of a properly engineered form of
government is to correct for this flaw in older forms of governments
(including the currently popular &quot;misrepresentative democracy&quot; form).

    Scott

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I actually hope the opposite: There's a lot on this issue on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> matchism.org, but to summarize: &quot;Public Policy&quot; is actually a synonym
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (or perhaps even a euphemism) for &quot;Social Engineering&quot;, yet the PP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> institutions (the JFK school being among the worst in this respect)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't teach engineering *or* anything scientific about social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interaction. Indeed, you can get a degree from these places without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ever having to take even one class in social psychology or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engineering. Which means they're actually promoting incompetent, or at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least amateurish, designs. Given that the primary goal of PP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> institutions seems to be to bolster leadership-based (i.e. SDAP-based)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government, I'd recommend being highly skeptical of anything they have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to say on the subject of social engineering or government design in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general. The examples discussed in that talk I think demonstrate this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clearly: They don't want direct democracy, they're merely working out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways to keep SDAP-leaders from screwing up without requiring that they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually give up any of their power.
