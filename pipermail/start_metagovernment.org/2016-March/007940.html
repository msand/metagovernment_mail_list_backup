<PRE>Hi folks. 

Yesterday I saw a presentation on virtual currency in which it was noted that these currencies are governed without any central authority, and further that they inherently contain the mechanics necessary to build open governance systems. 

I have not had time to delve into it deeply, but here is a paper on the subject:
<A HREF="https://www.ethereum.org/dao">https://www.ethereum.org/dao</A>

The code presented on that page seems to present a voting system that many of us would find primitive, but if I understand correctly that is just sample code, and more complex systems could be inserted. 

The most noteworthy thing here is that blockchain is vast, real, and currently handling billions of dollars worth of value transactions. It appears to work; so it seems like a great foundation for more sophisticated governance platforms to build on. 

</PRE>
