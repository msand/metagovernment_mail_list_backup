<PRE>Thanks, Scott.  I had already seen your About page and now I have converted
the information it provides to StratML format for inclusion in our
collection at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#CATO">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#CATO</A>

My inquiry was prompted by the fund-raising letter I received.  Please
advise your management that while I am inclined to contribute to
organizations with values like CATO's, I no longer contribute to
organizations who don't have strategic plans.  If they don't know what
they're trying to accomplish or don't care to share those plans with their
stakeholders, their efforts are simply not worth my time or money.

Please note also that it seems to me your outputs (publications &amp;
events/forums) are &quot;classical&quot; in the worst sense of the word, as
highlighted on your About page.

I encourage CATO consider incorporating the StratML standard (ANSI/AIIM
21:2009) into a more progressive and potentially far more effective social
networking strategy in support of your mission and values.  If your leaders
are willing to strive to do so, that is a cause to which I will be more than
willing to contribute both my time as well as my money.

BTW, I'm copying my colleague on the Metagov listserv to challenge them to
target CATO and your stakeholders as potential users of the types of
services they aim to provide.  While those services are immature and not yet
ready for prime time, their intended purposes are highly supportive of
CATO's values:  <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#Metagov">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#Metagov</A>

Do you have a strategic plan?  If so, I'd like to convert it to StratML
format for inclusion in our collection at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#Nonprofits">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#Nonprofits</A>
The purposes of the StratML standard are outlined at
