Who are these people? :-) Can't they do e-democracy (just a little)
without incorporating, setting up offices, and giving themselves
titles?  If I had funds to donate to e-democracy, I'd give 'em to the
folks who are doing the real work.  At the moment, that appears to be
Steven Clift and his crew.  Who else is out there on the front lines?
(And indeed, they are funded.)  So the first order of business (at
least for this workhorse) is either to join 'em, or to emulate 'em:

Then what happens after that - after we put the horses in front of the
cart - I don't know.  Maybe we'll organize, just like you say.  But at
least we'll have something to show for our efforts (something better
than the embarrassment of an empty and inactive organization).

I think it has to be public ownership, as I'll argue during this poll:

&gt;<i> Ok, so I started a poll: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/owdo">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/owdo</A>
</I>
OK.  This is useful, because agreement here will give us a domain
name.  (So, not only will we be active *in* e-democracy, we'll also be
active *under* a domain name.  (The cart begins to move. :-)

I'll post on p/owdo in a separate thread.

</I>
Well, I can see the humour in it.  That's one sorry-ass poll, and the
remaining participant isn't much interested in it either.  Easy come,
easy go. :-)
