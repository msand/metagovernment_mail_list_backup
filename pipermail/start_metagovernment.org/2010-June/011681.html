The issue of &quot;urgency&quot; has come up before, for example at:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ#Emergency_Planning">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ#Emergency_Planning</A>
and my opinion is that it is a red herring.

First, most Metagovernment projects are not starting as massive  
international or international projects; they are more focused on  
small organizations. The sort of crisis that a small organization may  
face usually does not entail life-or-death immediacy.

But more generally, I think that urgency itself is a question of  
consensus. Is there a consensus that there is an urgency in the first  
place? If not, then what need is there for action? If there is a  
consensus that something must be done right away, then people who are  
used to operating under collaborative governance systems should be  
able to reach a speedy consensus. If they all agree that something has  
to be done, then they are going to be much more willing to figure out  
what that something is.

Further nuance is provided at the above link. (Most notably, that  
collaborative governance does not preclude leaders, only *empowered*  
leaders.)
