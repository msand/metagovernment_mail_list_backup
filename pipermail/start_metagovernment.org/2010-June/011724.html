Haha, Dude that's awesome, but given that we're wanting to *attract*
those types, putting an insult on their door maaay not keep them.  My
solution:   At the end of the first paragraph or the third:   &quot;Need
more persuasion?  [[Why this project is needed. | Check this]].&quot;

It should be noted that the only community sites that have been
running since the beginning are geeky ones (slashdot, for example).
Who else?

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, but if *your* ideas (about what is meaningful, useful, etc.) were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sufficient, we wouldn't be arguing here and you wouldn't be baffled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now about the lack of interest on the website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My post was not about a lack of interest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was about how when I discuss the project with regular people, they say
</I>&gt;<i> they visit the site and they don't get it. I think that the language in your
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Why...&quot; page would make that reaction even stronger. I believe we need to
</I>&gt;<i> simplify our approach, not geek it up.
</I>
Yeah, but you're philosophizing, speculating.  Tell them to go to the
page, get the feedback, and *then* give me your opinion.

&gt;<i> What you and I are identifying are two very different audiences. Yours is
</I>&gt;<i> what you claim is the techno-elite. Mine is the majority of people. I think
</I>&gt;<i> the Main Page should be something that reaches out to the vast majority of
</I>&gt;<i> people. ...
</I>
Yes the main page should be approachable by everyone -- no argument.
I wasn't suggesting to trash your page.  I set it one link off -- nice
safe and sound for the masses you wish to attract.

&gt;<i> The geeks can find links to geeky content without significant help
</I>&gt;<i> from us.
</I>
Not true.  It's an information overload problem.  You have to cater to
them because *they will be the ones building it*.  Look at the fucking
history of wikipedia-- it was fueled by geeky misfits.  Not saying you
have to, there are other sites looking to meet this *need* too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And separately, I personally do not think that governance software should
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rely on trust.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have you tried to run a family without trust? &#160;Without trust, there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *NO SYNTHESIS*. &#160;I'm a philosophy guy, too. &#160;Please contemplate this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't agree at all. Most organizations that need formal governance do not
</I>&gt;<i> have trust. But they can still achieve synthesis.
</I>
Dude(!), if you want &quot;formal governance&quot; go to fucking D.C.   Go be a
Old School CEO.  Who has formal governance and achieves synthesis that
isn't operating below 0.1 Internet speed?  Who? eh?  I'm talking about
building a new kind community.  I'm sure you must already know this
because it's one of the things which attracted me to your site.
So.... what up?

&gt;<i> If we require trust before even attempting synthesis, then we will get
</I>&gt;<i> nothing except solutions to insignificant problems among homogenous
</I>&gt;<i> populations.
</I>
Dude that is NOT true.  How do you even make this argument in
seriousness?  Wikipedia gave *everyone* *edit authority* on the *front
page* -- was that an insignificant homogenous population or result?
Do you honestly think that wikipedia would have been successful
without trust?  Anyyway, the point it MOOT -- wiki has already
achieved/solved the synthesis!  Trust was and still *IS* the
answer!!!!

So, anyway, I'm not saying that trust is required before attempting
synthesis -- it is the outcome of synthesis, dammit!  If you look at
my writeup on [[synthesis]] you will see that one side of the other,
however, DOES have to take a risk in order to achieve it.  Secondly,
you have to be imaginative.  Trust can build innovating solutions that
have never been seen.  Do you ever wonder why artists (and geeks for
that matter) place themselves outside society?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Governance, politics, and such are about conflict, distrust,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and competing interests. If we simply hope everyone will get along, then
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> why
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> do we need governance at all?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) To help us remember ourselves. &#160;2) To resolve historical disputes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whose resolution has yet to be propagated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But... everyone does *not* get along. Hoping doesn't make it true. (A
</I>&gt;<i> synthesis mechanism might, though.)
</I>
Hey, I didn't say hope!  I'm saying build it first, assuming a priori
that everyone is trustable and let the result come later.  But anyway,
yeah, well okay, a synthesis mechanism.  I've got it.   The question
remaining is where will it be built?

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I know your point well, but you could just as well say that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> putting trust in automated solutions is prey to those who will &quot;game
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the system&quot; (unless the very leader/maintainer of the system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> him/herself is Trusted (and then will THAT last over century?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Remember this problem is over 2000 yrs old.))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. We've already discussed on this list a simple solution. Well, it is
</I>&gt;<i> technically difficult to implement, but the idea is very simple: to have no
</I>&gt;<i> single administrator. Instead I propose we eventually have multiple,
</I>&gt;<i> redundant, distributed admins. Each one is check-summed by all the others,
</I>&gt;<i> so any implementation which deviates from the trusted trunk is deprecated
</I>&gt;<i> from the aggregate &quot;administration.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, as I say above, I propose a distributed system that goes further than
</I>&gt;<i> any current cloud in that it distributes administration to an unlimited
</I>&gt;<i> number of authoritative but independent admins who cross-check each other.
</I>
But you are freaking missing years of software and open source
history.  This scenario was played out decades ago man, by Stallman
and others.  Here's what happens:  Person X says &quot;Hey, I'm not getting
the attention I want&quot;.   He then starts his own fork and 6 months
later through various specious means (&quot;embrace and extend&quot; --familiar
with that approach?) has attracted half of your population into his
(more-closed) system.  Now you are CIH, wondering WTF?

Anyway what you are talking about is essentially a reputation network,
or meritocracy.  They key ingredient is not oodles of checks and
balances (since you're from D.C., you've heard that term before,
right?) but fostering a feeling of shared ownership -- that is the
only reason wikipedia excelled above everyone else (not a hundred
&quot;authoritative admins&quot; cross-checking each other).  And what fosters
that feeling?  Well, read the page on Trust.  Note that each of those
points is basically just an iteration of the GNU philosophy.

&gt;<i> But if you are talking in terms of the project, then by all means fork it.
</I>&gt;<i> As I noted, your pages do not seem to be getting interest from other current
</I>&gt;<i> members of this group. Feel free to start another one with &quot;your people.&quot; I
</I>&gt;<i> will even support a &quot;second trunk.&quot; That is, a second version of the wiki,
</I>&gt;<i> or a different branch of the wiki that operates in tandem with the one
</I>&gt;<i> oriented toward regular folk. Alternately, you might just want to put your
</I>&gt;<i> effort into developing Candiwi, which is, after all, the original
</I>&gt;<i> geek-branch of this project.
</I>
While your suggestion is apt, there are currently not sufficient
mechanisms in the wiki software to evaluate the success of such a
fork.  And as the project (for me, at least) is about community, I am
loathe to go renegade.  Besides, the resources needed to truly take
the wiki software to the next level (like candiwi aims to be) simply
aren't there to make what I want happen.  So for now, I am only
looking to start the beachhead.  A simple link on the front page --
that's all...

Anyway, thanks for the dialog ;^)
