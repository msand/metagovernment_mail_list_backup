</I>
We might take it as a windfall.  Ever since the word &quot;democracy&quot; was
popularized (an innovation of Robespierre's they say [1]), politicians
have been waving it around and wrapping themselves in it.  That should
tell us something: people want democracy.  So imagine what happens
when they actually attain it.  All those politicians will fall (neatly
wrapped) into their hands, unable to say a word in protest.[2]

But if we call it something other than &quot;democracy&quot; (&quot;collaborative
governance&quot; or whatever) then people will wonder, &quot;What are they
talking about?&quot;  And those who are opposed will be quick to tell them,
&quot;It is not democracy.&quot;

I was also under the impression (just like you) that the status quo
included instances of online discussion - ordinary people talking
about political issues, affairs of state, and that kind of thing.  But
when I looking for examples of it, and asked around, we could only
find a few instances - and those few would not have existed without
the deliberate efforts of e-democracy.org.  So I no longer think of
grassroots discussion as part of the status quo, but rather as
something new in an early, seedling stage.

</I>&gt;<i> have the explosive mix, right? All 3 ingredients are necesarry.
</I> 
I agree with Thomas, it's a crucial ingredient.  I also point (again)
to the historical precedence for this kind of mix.  The explosions and
(as you say) revamps of the late 1700's were preceded by a boom in
public discussion.  Back then, the communication technology was
printing presses.  Together with improved transport and postal
services, higher literacy rates, the organization of subscription
libraries, reading societies and so forth, it was all too much for the
status quo.  People who were formerly silent (middle class) suddenly
began speaking out, raising issues that had never been raised before.
The authorities couldn't deflect or suppress all the critique.  As a
consequence, people won the approximation of democracy that we enjoy
(and often take for granted) today.  So it appears that discussion is
a social prerequisite for democracy.[3][4]

It is also a technical prerequisite for *e*-democracy.  The tools of
e-democracy cannot conjure discussion/dialogue out of thin air (we see
no examples of that).  So they can only be effective (it appears) when
they are used by healthy communities, already engaged with political
issues, and so forth.


[1] Dunn said it: <A HREF="http://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/contacts/staff/jdunn.html">http://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/contacts/staff/jdunn.html</A>
    I think it was in &quot;Setting the People Free: The Story of
    Democracy&quot;.

[2] At best, they could reach back and remind you (Americans at least)
    that the architects of what we call &quot;modern democracy&quot; or
    &quot;representative democracy&quot; would have been horrified to hear us
    using those terms.  They equated democracy with faction, strife
    and instability: <A HREF="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm">http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm</A>

    Public Sphere.  Translated by Thomas Burger, 1989.  MIT Press,
    Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Chapters 4-9, pp. 27-73.  E.g.:

    The exclusion of the public from the parliamentary deliberations
    could no longer be maintained at a time [1771] in which &quot;Memory&quot;
    Woodfall was able to make the Morning Chronicle into the leading
    London daily paper because he could reproduce verbatim sixteen
    columns of parliamentary speeches without taking notes in the
    gallery of the House of Commons, which was prohibited. (p. 61)

[4] Wiliiam Doyle. 1989.  The Oxford History of the French Revolution.
    Oxford University Press.  Chapter 2, pp. 44-65.  E.g.:

    The years between 1758 and 1764 saw the last attempt by the
    traditional organs of censorship to prevent the open discussion of
    matters of state, whether religious, administrative, or financial.
    Attempts to suppress the *Encyclop&#233;die*, the works of Rousseau,
    and other speculative writings were part of this pattern.  So was
    a royal declaration of 1764 prohibiting public sale of any works
    relating to the finances or administration of the State.  But the
    line could not be held... When Maupeou remodelled the parlements,
    he hired a team of writers to praise and defend what he was doing.
    But, mused an anxious and well-placed observer, 'each step makes
    matters worse.  Somebody writes, another replies... everybody will
    want to analyze the constitution of the state; tempers will be
    lost.  Issues are being raised which nobody would have dared think
    of...  the knowledge that people are acquiring must, a little
    sooner or a little later, bring about revolutions.'  (p. 56)
