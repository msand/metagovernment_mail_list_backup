I misspoke here, since of course the page in question is a pollwiki  
page, not a Votorola one. Please excuse my poor participation (and  
thus misstatements) recently. I hope to be able to devote much more  
time to this project starting in a couple months.

As far as I am concerned, my draft is legitimate copy for either  
project (or for the unification of the two). However, at the moment,  
it is written with Metagovernment in mind. If others would like to  
improve it, please, please do so. If it is more appropriate for it to  
exist on a different wiki from where it is (ie, on the pollwiki, so it  
can be voted for or or against), please let me know... or go ahead and  
transcribe it there. But clearly it needs more work before it can be  
voted on.
