Perhaps by adding in some of the prose from
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-06">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-06</A> ?

If I (or someone else) wanted to take a stab at that, would it be most  
appropriate to edit your draft or to fork it? Sorry, still getting  
used to the interface/philosophy...

&gt;&gt;<i> ... Are you suggesting this for the Metagovernment home page? (Or is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that a question implied in the question of what to call the FRVP?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Implied.  We need a home page for the entire cross-project effort.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether that effort is covered under the Metagoverment marquee (as you
</I>&gt;<i> suggest) or under a new umbrella (as Thomas suggests), this is to be
</I>&gt;<i> its home page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If &quot;project FRVP&quot; isn't a good placeholder, please suggest another
</I>&gt;<i> (anyone).  It's better if all drafts of the home page use the same
</I>&gt;<i> name (it simplifies the difference bridging).
</I>
So, fork your draft? Would I use
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Ed-EdpastoreCom/G/p/mho">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Ed-EdpastoreCom/G/p/mho</A> ?

And what does that mean, anyway? That is, what do G, p, and mho stand  
for? Is that Global, plan, and (arbitrary)?

&gt;&gt;<i> ... I continue to suggest that free- range voting, while not the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entirety of the mission of Metagovernment, is still quite a large
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part of it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, it's only a part of the larger picture.  See, for example:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/frvp">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/frvp</A>
</I>&gt;<i> But that's all technical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It gets political, at this point.  If we tell the users what they can
</I>&gt;<i> do, it'll read like a political manifesto - the home page.
</I>
A political manifesto or a software description? For example, Firefox  
touts how wonderful it is...
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html</A>

We are in a strange position of advocating a sort of political  
ideology within the context of advocating a framework that can suit  
people of any political ideology. In other words... as sort of meta- 
politics. :) We do firmly advocate certain principles like democracy  
and transparency, but take no stand on any particular sociopolitical  
issue.

&gt;<i> Also, who owns/controls the domain name of the umbrella?  Under what
</I>&gt;<i> terms?
</I>
I have always been seeking a way to cede control of  
metagovernment.org. Likewise, in Thomas' proposal, he expresses a  
desire to cede freevoters.org. It's just that whichever name we use  
needs some entity to be ceded to. The problem I have chronically  
encountered with Metagovernment is that most entities, in order to  
have any recognition by other institutions (namely governments and  
banks, with which they would have to show legitimacy in order to have  
control over resources) have to have designated, empowered leaders. It  
would be a violation of our own core principles to, for example, have  
me cede metagovernment.org to a formal non-profit called  
Metagovernment which is headed by an elected and empowered board of  
directors.
