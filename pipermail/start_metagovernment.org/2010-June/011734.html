<PRE>Hello PdI-people,

I was on holiday. I also want to welcome you on our list!

Wow, quite a discussion you started here. Please don't take offence if 
the tone gets a bit rough at times. It's not just in this discussion, it 
has been like this in other threads too.

To some degree I share the wish for anonymity with you guys. And I hope 
that the future will bring a trustworthy technology for that.

And at first sight it does indeed look like the public would expect the 
PdI to offer privacy in voting.

Now, what will be private in any case, are ofc the votes for the party 
itself (in the general elections). I think, this is the main expectation 
of the public concerning privacy.

Where the party gets its program from is a new and different issue. And 
here you are constructing a historical new model of a party anyway. Now, 
I&#180;m not sure, if polls inside a traditional party about its program are 
always held in private. I think in many cases its done in public. Plus: 
the only similiar thing to a party-program-poll which the public is used 
to right now (at least in Germany) are petitions. And those even have to 
be public by law. So the people will not expect it differently.

So both expectations (private elections, but public petitions) can be 
fullfilled without long waiting for that new technology to come.

But I think what is really against the expectation of the people, is 
that not only party-members are allowed to vote but everybody. Why is 
this necessary or useful?

Greetings,
Thomas
