<PRE>If possible, I'd like to return this thread back to the original  
question... how to make the main page more approachable. I think  
Michael had some good stuff going with: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/mho">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/mho</A>

I also think Mat&#237;as had some good insight below.

Mat&#237;as, in response to your Part Two below, that was the point of my  
new draft:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-06">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-06</A>
All it is at the moment is an addition of one sentence at the top.  
Does that help?

&gt;<i> Part One: Impatience is a problem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I didn't have time to wade through it all.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that every web visitor is often impatient, even me,  
</I>&gt;<i> because I've found myself &#8212;sometimes&#8212; with that anxiety that makes  
</I>&gt;<i> you quit a website when you haven't read enough of it. If you suffer  
</I>&gt;<i> this kind of disease, then...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What keeps you reading a website? Understanding this would help us  
</I>&gt;<i> to design a better homepage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, when I want to know about something, I search it on the  
</I>&gt;<i> internet and take some time to visit pages and truly read them; but  
</I>&gt;<i> if the curiosity isn't mine &#8212;&quot;hey, check this out&quot; written in a  
</I>&gt;<i> blog, chat, etc&#8212; I tend to behave anxiously.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It turns out that the first case comprehends the people that have  
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts similar to Metagovernment's, google them, find our site,  
</I>&gt;<i> and possibly join the list. That's not a problem, as the second  
</I>&gt;<i> case. Metagovernment is an idea, that want to be considered by those  
</I>&gt;<i> who haven't in orden to be supported... and ideas normally spread  
</I>&gt;<i> out by means of recommendations (curiosity isn't yours).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Part Two: A proposal
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What keeps me reading a website? Understanding. If the 20 first  
</I>&gt;<i> words haven't explained me anything (*), I feel that I'm reading a  
</I>&gt;<i> nonconducting paragraph and quit. Whenever possibly, we may write in  
</I>&gt;<i> a way that every word partially adds a bit of understanding, not  
</I>&gt;<i> just information. (Normally you'd have to read a whole paragraph to  
</I>&gt;<i> tell about &#8212;at least&#8212; a part of it. I'm referring to the opposite:  
</I>&gt;<i> read part, tell part.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that writing is difficult or impossible to achieve, maybe the  
</I>&gt;<i> situation of Metagovernment concept, we shouldn't write at all...  
</I>&gt;<i> let's draw.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that some websites make use of videos. Personally, I don't like  
</I>&gt;<i> them. If a video lasts 3 minutes I think I can understand the idea  
</I>&gt;<i> in 1, using text and images (quiting if I can't find them). Provided  
</I>&gt;<i> these two things, then we could put an institutional video for those  
</I>&gt;<i> not on the mood of reading.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Part Three: Extra problem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I don't get it yet.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reading but still not understanding. The idea of governance through  
</I>&gt;<i> the internet is kind of abstract and difficult to grasp. (I've noted  
</I>&gt;<i> this too when talking to people too!) We should be more concrete,  
</I>&gt;<i> put an example... for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ----
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I'm not asking for everything, just something.
