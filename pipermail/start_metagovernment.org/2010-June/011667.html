I'd like to take exception here to the idea that the public expects  
privacy in voting. Personally, I think it is a matter of how you  
&quot;sell&quot; the process.

The public expects anonymity in voting for elected officials. However,  
they by no means expect those officials to maintain anonymity in their  
votes in, for example, the legislature. (At least that is usually the  
case here in the US, and I assume elsewhere. In the US, Congress can  
get away with semi-anonymous voting sometimes, but the great majority  
of the time it is a matter of public record.)

So if we are asking people to vote on legislation, then we are asking  
them to take the role of legislators, not of the electorate. We simply  
need to convince the public that as direct voters on legislation, they  
should not have an expectation of anonymity. I do think this can be a  
relatively easy sell.

Additionally, there are many other instances where people vote without  
the expectation of anonymity. At almost any public meeting where  
people are asked to raise their hands in favor of something, they are  
not acting anonymously. Granted, their vote may not be recorded, but  
their friends and neighbors who look around the room can see how they  
vote. And again, in this case, they are usually voting on policy, as  
opposed to voting for a represented.

So that's the distinction. If you are voting for a representative, you  
want anonymity so that the winner of the election won't persecute you  
for voting against him or her. If you are voting on policy, you are  
expected to express your opinion publicly, just as you are expected to  
argue for it publicly.

In liquid democracy systems, there is no need to fear the proxy- 
holders, since they have no permanence to their power. So there is no  
reason to protect our identity from them.
