I added a bunch of formatting changes to that.  Just to get them out
of the way before hammering out the content.  Is this OK?

&gt;<i> I agree with Mike, that its much faster and therefore better to do
</I>&gt;<i> it without an organization first. But I can imagine, that the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;caretakers&quot; organize after that. There would be three steps:
</I>&gt;<i> caretakers - organization - public...  What do you think?
</I>
Just to add: the probability of veto (and loss of domain name)
increases exponentially with the number of caretakers.  More than 4 is
probably unworkable.  So we should be careful not to present the
caretakers as being in any kind of privledged or honoured position.
The only people who should be caretakers (ideally) are those who
simply must, e.g. because they already own the domain name, or control
the servers (or whatever), and would be unwilling to cede
ownership/control without being made caretaker.

&gt;<i> ... And an organization in support of the whole thing can ofc still
</I>&gt;<i> exist after all that and without legal control of the domain...
</I>
Maybe this domain agreement will set the example of how to handle a
support organization?  If the public can own a domain name, why not a
support organization?  But just as the domain caretakers *already*
have a stake in the domain name, the pioneers of the organization
would have to *already* have a stake in the supporting effort.  They
would have to be doing the real support work.  (A case of walking the
walk, before talking the talk.)

Here's an organization for the support of real democracy at the
grassroots (or so they say): <A HREF="http://www.polarisinstitute.org/">http://www.polarisinstitute.org/</A>
