<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> While this is generally true at some levels, it cannot be true at all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> levels. &#160;The issue of timing and *need* requires decisions without the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> luxury of consensus or a (both/and) grey middle. &#160; Ultimately that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what the executive branch is charged with doing, for example. &#160;Make a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;gut&quot; decision and live with the/any consequences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue of &quot;urgency&quot; has come up before, for example at:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ#Emergency_Planning">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ#Emergency_Planning</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and my opinion is that it is a red herring.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> But more generally, I think that urgency itself is a question of consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a consensus that there is an urgency in the first place? If not,
</I>&gt;<i> then what need is there for action? If there is a consensus that something
</I>&gt;<i> must be done right away, then people who are used to operating under
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance systems should be able to reach a speedy consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> If they all agree that something has to be done, then they are going to be
</I>&gt;<i> much more willing to figure out what that something is.
</I>
This is a decent analysis, but I must say that as soon as you ask the
damn question:  &quot;Is this an urgent situation?&quot;  Then the answer is
*already* no.  Urgent situations are one's where that luxury doesn't
exist (the mental dialog), OR the indulgence in that luxury would
create a unacceptable lack of progress.  Examine carefully people who
are procrastinators.

&gt;<i> First, most Metagovernment projects are not starting as massive
</I>&gt;<i> international or international projects; they are more focused on small
</I>&gt;<i> organizations. The sort of crisis that a small organization may face usually
</I>&gt;<i> does not entail life-or-death immediacy.
</I>
 I'd say the issue of scale (nations vs small organizations) is a red
herring.  While the scope of consequence may not be as great in the
long term, in the short term there  is *need* to make progress.  As a
solitary individual, for example, when faced with two equally good
choices, one must not end up like Buriden's Ass and starve oneself
with indecision.

&gt;<i> Further nuance is provided at the above link. (Most notably, that
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance does not preclude leaders, only *empowered*
</I>&gt;<i> leaders.)
</I>
This point I think needs further debate.  I think a reputation network
would offer efficient allocation of decision-making authority while
also being fair; notably, it would *not* require consensus on every
decision (but transparency and accountability take care of that).
