It's unfortunate that the wiki software does not make it easy to
follow the logic of the thread.

Dude, I KNOW you don't see it (!) -- that is the *point* of
collaborative governance and the *genius* of the wiki philosophy.
Need I say more?  But, you do however raise a deficiency within the
mediawiki software as it currently stands (and one which I have
mentioned on my Userpage).  If you put it up to the wiki model as it
stands, you would just revert it to your liking and there would be an
edit &quot;war&quot; (or a compromise)--hardly sufficient (as can be seen right
here).  I've proposed the wiki software be modified to be more
probabilistic with a simple (reddit-like) voting mechanism for
weighting different versions of a page and displaying those revisions
in a probabilistic matter.

And as to the point that you &quot;hope it to be beneficial&quot; -- I already
addressed this too and this very same point was raised by targetrace.
*I NEED IT*  Is that sufficient?  I don't think I'm alone, otherwise
(like the page [[Why this project is needed]] points out) there
wouldn't be dozens of similar sites reaching for the solution to this
problem.

My page points to &quot;my&quot; audience.  My audience isn't going to spend the
time arguing with you because it takes an enormous amount of patience
and energy to construct a legible reply.  Either it finds a welcoming
environment or it simply leaves and goes elsewhere.  Your pages are
like textbooks -- reasonable, but that is all.  IOW, they hook onto
reason.  My pages hook on to emotion.  Consider it a sort of
alchemical catalyst whose presence, like in chemistry, can't really be
accounted for, but nonetheless, provides a unique and valuable service
to a process that would ordinarily take 100x as long.  (Do you want to
wait until 10 million people &quot;get it&quot;?)  The page doesn't serve you
because you are already among their numbers and can be dispatched, or
&quot;take leave&quot;.

And, btw, &quot;my users&quot; depend on *trust*--and it is exactly why the Free
software environment/community came into being (*and* why it places
**itself** outside the conventional world).   I find it discouraging
that you have removed some of the references to it. Is it personal?

Marcos
