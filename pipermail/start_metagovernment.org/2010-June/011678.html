Everything I have said in this thread refers to elections/referenda, which
if you remember, is the target of the channel that PdI aims to create. PdI
does not intend, at the moment, to propose/elaborate policy, although this
may be added as an essential element in later stages. The first step, and
priority, is to establish a voting channel, which is very ambitious already.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The last one is the focus of this group. When individuals are asked to
</I>&gt;<i> create policy, there are very good reasons for them to put their reputation
</I>&gt;<i> on the line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no objection to systems which can support privacy (and David, I laud
</I>&gt;<i> your tenacity in fielding criticism from so many fronts). However, I am
</I>&gt;<i> strongly leaning toward emphasizing public voting... much more so than I was
</I>&gt;<i> when this thread started.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Our system requires public voting for those persons/institutions/entities
that label themselves as representatives, ie recipients of delegated votes
(in a liquid democracy context) so that voters can observe their voting
behaviour and act accordingly.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it may be nice to have the capacity to support both anonymous and
</I>&gt;<i> public systems, but in the end public is the goal (I think we all agree on
</I>&gt;<i> that so some extent), so I'd like to see it get into peoples' minds sooner
</I>&gt;<i> rather than later.
