Yes, I do not think that the change of culture necessary for widespread
acceptance of public voting will occur in the near future.


&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Me too.  I was attracted by your dismal view of public voting. :-)
</I>

Please accept my apologies if I have caused offense. I  have great respect
for your work here at MG.

I have just stated what I think the public expects, and that the people I
have talked to (experts in researching voting schemes) do not consider
public voting systems seriously for the purposes of replacing or
complementing current private election methods.

There's also the choice of words. In the literature, a &quot;secure&quot; voting
system usually implies privacy.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... Achieving credibility ... requires guarantees of privacy and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; universal verifiability (for starters).  I have already seen that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there are issues such as vote buying, coercion, that are hard to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solve even with a secure system, let alone public voting...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For now, I take it you no longer think that public voting is insecure;
</I>&gt;<i> in particular, you no longer think it is prone to vote buying,
</I>&gt;<i> coercion and other types of voter corruption (I answered you on that).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not so fast :-D. What I have said is that it doesnt matter what I think, so
long as society has decided on the matter.

If you want to know, I dont have a qualified opinion. My intuition tells me
that coercion and vote buying are serious problems for public voting, based
on the widespread practice of private voting for elections, and the 20+
years of research into private, coercion resistant remote voting systems. It
would probably take much more than a short email to convince me that these
issues do not exist. But, I repeat, so long as society does not accept
 (imo) public voting, it is a moot point for the case at hand.

For what it's worth, I'd be delighted if you were right and convinced the
general public of it.


&gt;<i> Nor do you think it is difficult to verify the results of a public
</I>&gt;<i> voting system (obviously it is not).  Your only concern is that the
</I>&gt;<i> general population does not expect a public voting system (on this we
</I>&gt;<i> agree) and will reject it (on this we agree to disagree).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Setting all that aside, we could focus on the likelihood of
</I>&gt;<i> success/failure for a private voting system.  Before beginning, I
</I>&gt;<i> would ask you to briefly describe your method of verification.  What
</I>&gt;<i> assurance will you give people that the results are trustworthy?
</I>&gt;<i> (Just roughly, in a sentence or two.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A voting system that satisfies this property is said to be universally
verifiable. You can read up on this in the literature, but basically
a universal verifiable voting scheme allows any third party to verify (in a
mathematically provable way) the results of an election. This usually
involves a public bulletin board, where all the data from an election is
posted for anyone and everyone to see.

Regards,

David
