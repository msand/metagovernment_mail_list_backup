<PRE>Argh. My time is very limited right now, and this thread is getting  
beyond the point where I wanted to interject.

I am delighted to see you unlurking, Paul, as your comments are very  
insightful. Particularly that the Main Page needs to preempt the &quot;it  
will never work&quot; attitude more than anything else.

Combining that with Mat&#237;as' idea that we need to appeal to the limited  
attention-span of modern internet surfers, I started working on a very  
rough draft of a complete re-write of the Main Page. Perhaps this  
helps address Mark's concerns as well, as it is simply a new and more  
personal approach,

Michael, I am not putting this on my Votorola page yet because it is  
extremely rough, and I would like to invite others to work on the  
draft. It is simply all I could do at the moment. There clearly needs  
to be more. If that appropriate, or is there a compelling reason for  
for me to put it on  my Votorola page?

So with all of that said, have a look at:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-06/v2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-06/v2</A>
and see if you can build it out from there. (Or alternatively  
criticize the idea and perhaps offer your own draft.)
