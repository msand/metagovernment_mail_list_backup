<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; The job of the caretakers is to guard the domain name against

Yes. &quot;All rights of veto are lost on supersession [= transfer to
public ownership].&quot;

&gt;<i> I imagine this does not sound very trustworthy to the public. They

</I>&gt;<i> ownership-conditions a caretaker comes along and pulls out his  
</I>&gt;<i> veto ...! No, thanks!&quot;
</I>
I think you're right.  So they'd probably ask:

&gt;<i> Please describe a case, where such a veto would be of worth for a  
</I>&gt;<i> caretaker. I think, if we find good ownership-conditions, we dont  
</I>&gt;<i> need a veto altogether. The caretakers would just stick to it no  
</I>&gt;<i> matter what.
</I>
 a) The caretaker is unable to verify the the 1000-vote consensus,
    because the verification system is not fully functional yet.
    Also, the consensus looks suspicious to him.

    So he uses his veto to delay the supersession, until the votes can
    be properly verified.

 b) The public reaches consensus, but the caretaker judges that the
    ownership terms they agreed to are legally weak.  He worries that
    an untrustworthy entity might sieze ownership and monetize the
    domain, or vandalize it.

    So he uses his veto (again) to delay the supersession, allowing
    more time for discussion of the consequences.

I think it's only the public who can tell us what's good, where the
public interest is at stake.  That's the apparent dilemma we're in
(temporary caretakers being the escape).

</I>
So the public eventually reaches consensus on that?  I agree, a
caretaker would probably use a delaying veto for reasons of (b).  He
would then ask people if they understood the consequences of
permanently transferring control to private hands.

Note this is very close to our grandest use case (executive caretaker
body = status quo government).  So it feels like the right direction.

&gt;<i> Use the domain name now with a site license of CCSA, or CCSANC.
</I>
So we do this now, *instead* of an interim caretaker arrangement?  I
guess that would leave open the question of who controls the domain
name (right?).  It's a crucial issue, of course, because the owning
body can redirect traffic wherever it pleases.

&gt;<i> If you wish to preserve a veto then it is also important to be very
</I>&gt;<i> clear about the path you are 'requiring' for the future.  Documenting
</I>&gt;<i> this is probably more important than preserving a veto as only then
</I>&gt;<i> will be sure you are having a discussion about positive action.
</I>
I agree.  It's the *intention* of supersession that's crucial.  It's
way more important than all the legalese and formal terms of transfer.
The intention (assuming we agree) is to place the domain name squarely
in public hands.  So we'd have to make sure that (and the reasons for
it) were very clear, especially to the public themselves.

Organizing would still be an option for the future.  But if we reach
agreement tomorrow on the domain name, then we can start serving the
common pollwiki/streetwiki under that name.  On the other hand, if we
wait for an agreement on an organizational structure, then it would
take months (at best) before we could move forward.  (Our competitors
would be going full steam ahead, and laughing at us.)

Besides, I know you'll agree that the common infrastructure has to be
owned by the public (those who are using it).  So, it follows that
they (not us) ought to be defining the organizational structure and
all the other terms of their ownership.  But that's a problem, because
we can't support public consensus building yet (not quite).  The tools
are still in alpha.  So we have to buy a little time and (as Thomas
and Alex say) be clear about our intensions in the meantime.

So that still needs to be added.  But nothing needs to be subtracted,
right?  We're headed in the right direction, here:
