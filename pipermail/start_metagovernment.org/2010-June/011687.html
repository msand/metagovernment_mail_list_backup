<PRE>Sr. Alvaro,

Buenos Dias.

Your basic premise that public voting means coercing and private voting
means non-coercing itself may be wrong !!

In India we follow secret voting and still there is coercing.

In a truly open system (for convenience I call it democratic system, which
may be a misnomer as the so called current day democratic processes are
autocratic), the individuals should have a right to vote or not vote, vote
in public or private, publish their voting or keep it secret... but yet all
actions must be transparent for accountability without any coercion.

The issues to be voted must be open and debatable in public. The invitation
to vote must be open (public). The voting process must be open. The counting
and announcement must be open.

Open means, fool proof and fail proof; with audit trail of all actions for
accountability.

Am I right in my presumptions!!

Saludos.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I guess it follows: rather than arguing about it here, we should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working together to ensure that personal choices of this kind don't

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would that be possible in a voting scheme? I mean, one of the
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics of secure voting systems is no-coercion, what implies that
</I>&gt;<i> the voter can't prove what he had voted so nobody can force another people
</I>&gt;<i> to cast a determinated vote, or to buy votes. I think that's the main
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of secret voting: evading coercion (and social coercion).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If somebody can choose between public and private vote, another person can
</I>&gt;<i> force him (or pay him) to select public voting and publish the voote proof.
</I>&gt;<i> In a system where you can choose between a public and a private vote, is not
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely coercible, but it is coercible elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, the chance is: build a complete coercible system (public voting) a
</I>&gt;<i> non-coercible system (private voting) or a partial coercible system (mixed
</I>&gt;<i> public and private voting).
</I>&gt;<i>
