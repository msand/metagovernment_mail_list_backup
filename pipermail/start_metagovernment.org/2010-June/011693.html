<PRE>For some kinds of decisions, James Surowiecki argues that four conditions
are necessary for crowds to make wise decisions.  Two of those conditions
are:

	1) Diversity of opinion - Each person must have some private
information, even if it is just an eccentric interpretation of known facts.

	2) Independence - People's opinions must not be determined by the
opinions of those around them.

Jean Lipman-Blumen, says: &quot;Although it is hard to believe, we tend to prefer
toxic leaders for a host of tantalizing reasons...&quot; Indeed, she asserts,
&quot;When we don't have them, we go to great lengths to create them.&quot;

Coercion may not be necessary.  We may unwittingly conspire against our own
long-term interests, particularly under undue influence from others.

Offer to pay individuals $1, $10 or $100 to vote in a certain way, check 
their public vote and pay them.

Or an employer could suggest employees vote a certain way and check 
their public votes to see if they did. If they didn't they could find a 
reason to fire them or otherwise punish them.

Of course doing these things would be against local laws, but that 
doesn't mean it wouldn't happen.

With a secret vote this can't be effectively done because there is no 
way for a third party to verify how anyone actually voted.

It this stage, I think any software should allow administrators to 
choose between secret and public voting. Public voting isn't really a 
problem with small organization, where the stakes are low.
