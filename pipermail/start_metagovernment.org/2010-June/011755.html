<PRE>Just two short comments now (later more):

Yes, you are right! E-democracy.org seems to be mainly &quot;just&quot; a place 
for discussions. But if we combine &quot;their&quot; political discussion with 
&quot;our&quot; voting and collaborative drafting, then we have the explosive mix, 
right? All 3 ingredients are necesarry.

&gt;<i> Technical question. Aqain. So, I am on this page:

</I>
No its not demonstrating ignorance! :-) We had the same discussion. Now 
it is like this, that nobody can not vote for himself. If you are an 
end-candidate like you, you just keep collecting votes for you position, 
but your own vote will not show up in the results. Since it is the same 
for all end-candidates it is fair.

I thought of counting every persons vote automatically for his position, 
but there is one problem: now everybody can create a position-page for 
someone else. I think this is good. But in case it is done poorly, you 
would not assume the second persons approval, i.e. vote.

Actually I like your idea of being able to explicitly vote for oneself, 
because only this will give the correct count.
