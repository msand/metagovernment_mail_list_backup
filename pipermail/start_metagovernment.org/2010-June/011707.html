Yes, those pages were pretty bad, before.  Par for the course - it
usually takes 2-3 design iterations to get a workable UI.

I agree, it might not be a good test case.  I point to it because (to
me) it looks the most realistic of all our polls.  But it's always
been inactive, and only intended as a showcase.

The most active poll in terms of user energy was for Votorola's home
page.  It had (and still has) 2 whole users (!).  We learned a lot
from playing with it.  But I don't want to showcase it because it
doesn't look representative to me.  (Also, Thomas isn't defining poll
divisions and division maps in his areas, so the page layout is
missing something.)  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/vohall">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/vohall</A>

But for usability testing, the best issue is whatever most interests
people.  If you guys want to hammer out a home page for Metagov, for
example, that would be ideal.
