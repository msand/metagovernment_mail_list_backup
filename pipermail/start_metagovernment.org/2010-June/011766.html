Ah OK, I follow you.  You're probably right.

&gt;<i> But again, your point about using &quot;democracy&quot; is reasonable. That

Maybe we should just call it &quot;democracy&quot;.  Claiming that as the
unqualified goal would send a clear message.

&gt;<i> &gt; It is also a technical prerequisite for *e*-democracy.  The tools
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of e-democracy cannot conjure discussion/dialogue out of thin air
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (we see no examples of that).  So they can only be effective (it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appears) when they are used by healthy communities, already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; engaged with political issues, and so forth.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But doesn't that apply to communities of interest about anything
</I>&gt;<i> other than democracy? That is, wouldn't we have better traction in
</I>&gt;<i> an existing online community where people have a deep interest in
</I>&gt;<i> their core topic area, but no way to govern themselves other than
</I>&gt;<i> through the actions of an individual or a few representatives.
</I>
Yes, I think it must be &quot;other than democracy&quot;.  There is no traction
to be gained where people are thematizing democracy itself (talking
*about* democracy).  In places like that (such as this list, or the
technical e-dem lists) all we do is bicker over tools, terminology and
organizational boundaries - staking out ground and posturing - all
very tedious.

Meanwhile, (I can report) others are out on the streets screaming,
breaking windows, and setting cars on fire.  That's a little more
exciting, but just as pointless.

Between those two extremes, are places where ordinary people talk
about the issues that directly concern them.  In talking, they gain a
rapport and mutual understanding that, in turn, open up the
possibility (here is where we can maybe help) of coordinated action
and real effects.  Only in these places (I agree) can we hope to
actually *do* democracy, rather than just talking (or screaming) about
it.  And technically, we're ready for that (just barely).

Maybe it's time for some reconnaissance?  I guess we could do it
either individually, or in small scouting teams. (If anyone wants to
join me, I know a few places to explore - and maybe we can think of
others along the way.)

Best to all,
