<PRE>Hi all,

In my opinion, the following statement &quot;But still, for better or worse,
people have come to expect privacy in voting.  They have come to believe
that the secret ballot is a basic right (as though it were a hard won
victory over the
authorities, as opposed to an imposition by them!).  This is the sense in
which I concede to David, for sake of the argument, that people do indeed
expect privacy in voting&quot; is a presumption, unless substantiated by voting!!

Every one should have a choice for public or private voting on a case to
case basis and can differ each time or may be the same,

Kris Dev

&gt;<i> Ed and David,

</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Ed's points.  Public voting is a natural form of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have just stated what I think the public expects, and that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people I have talked to (experts in researching voting schemes) do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not consider public voting systems seriously for the purposes of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replacing or complementing current private election methods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But we cannot reply to &quot;experts told me so&quot; arguments.  If it's in the
</I>&gt;<i> literature, as you say, please cite your sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For my part, I cited a recent discussion among experts on the topic.
</I>&gt;<i> You may go into that forum and ask questions (they tend to be helpful
</I>&gt;<i> to non-experts).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's also the choice of words. In the literature, a &quot;secure&quot; voting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system usually implies privacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please provide references for this, too.  Where do you find that
</I>&gt;<i> public voting systems are generally characterized (I would say tarred)
</I>&gt;<i> by the label &quot;insecure&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... What I have said is that it doesnt matter what I think, so long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as society has decided on the matter. / If you want to know, I dont
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a qualified opinion. My intuition tells me...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, it's best just to cite your sources.  (We cannot debate on the
</I>&gt;<i> basis of intuition.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Setting all that aside, we could focus on the likelihood of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; success/failure for a private voting system.  Before beginning, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would ask you to briefly describe your method of verification.  What
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; assurance will you give people that the results are trustworthy?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (Just roughly, in a sentence or two.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A voting system that satisfies this property is said to be universally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; verifiable. You can read up on this in the literature, but basically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a universal verifiable voting scheme allows any third party to verify (in
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mathematically provable way) the results of an election. This usually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; involves a public bulletin board, where all the data from an election is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; posted for anyone and everyone to see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You did not answer the question.  Have you designed a verification
</I>&gt;<i> scheme, yet?
