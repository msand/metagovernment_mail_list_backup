Fair enough.  But just to be clear, we do not disagree that the public
expects privacy in voting.  We only disagree (or agree to disagree)
that they absolutely require it.

Me too.  I was attracted by your dismal view of public voting. :-)

&gt;<i> ... Achieving credibility ... requires guarantees of privacy and

For now, I take it you no longer think that public voting is insecure;
in particular, you no longer think it is prone to vote buying,
coercion and other types of voter corruption (I answered you on that).
Nor do you think it is difficult to verify the results of a public
voting system (obviously it is not).  Your only concern is that the
general population does not expect a public voting system (on this we
agree) and will reject it (on this we agree to disagree).

Setting all that aside, we could focus on the likelihood of
success/failure for a private voting system.  Before beginning, I
would ask you to briefly describe your method of verification.  What
assurance will you give people that the results are trustworthy?
(Just roughly, in a sentence or two.)
