<PRE>Regarding &quot;It this stage, I think any software should allow administrators
to choose between secret and public voting. Public voting isn't really a
problem with small organization, where the stakes are low&quot;., how would we
know if the Administrator is not coerced?!!

Best is an open system where each one chooses for himself / herself...
ensuring aninymity, if so chosen and yet transparent and accountable....
