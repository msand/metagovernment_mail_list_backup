<PRE>It's unfortunate that the wiki software does not make it easy to
follow the logic of the thread.

I see the dispute, but I don't see what you're proposing as the answer,
Mark. Is it the addition of that
link&lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Why_this_project_is_needed">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Why_this_project_is_needed</A>&gt;? I see
your point, but I don't think
that link (nor the tone of the linked page), is the way of achieving it. I
also don't necessarily agree with
the value judgement of saying this project is &quot;needed&quot; as much as it is
hoped to be beneficial.

Dude, I KNOW you don't see it (!) -- that is the *point* of
collaborative governance and the *genius* of the wiki philosophy.
Need I say more?  But, you do however raise a deficiency within the
mediawiki software as it currently stands (and one which I have
mentioned on my Userpage).  If you put it up to the wiki model as it
stands, you would just revert it to your liking and there would be an
edit &quot;war&quot; (or a compromise)--hardly sufficient (as can be seen right
here).  I've proposed the wiki software be modified to be more
probabilistic with a simple (reddit-like) voting mechanism for
weighting different versions of a page and displaying those revisions
in a probabilistic matter.



Compromise are not that bad.
E idea that a pov should be represented as much as it is supported is
the most democratic but less efficient way to reach an agreement. If
there is no bottleneck inevitably everybody will just sit on his
'truth' and avoid making the effort of looking for a  shared position.
It is not strange that we do not know how to solve this. This IS the
problem we are facing. If we solve it for wiki, we solve it for open
questions, we solve it for legislators, we solve it for everybody.

Vilfredo tried to be an answer to this problem. You liked i, you
didn't like it. In any case it was going in that direction. So is
candiwiki, so are traditional wiki, so is votorola (i believe).
And it all boil down to a few questions:

Who is allowed to suggest solutions?

How are different solutions proposed at different times competing with
each other? (older proposals are naturally advantaged. How do you
balance that if in any way?)

Do people vote for only one solution, for all the solutions that they
like for all grading them?
Can people suggest after the voring has started?

Hpw many answers are being selected as 'winning'?

Is the procedure going through a single generation, x generation,
unlimited generations until a consensual solution is reached?



I believe we could (and should) make a table with all those
differences as rows, and as columns the type of systems out there.

Until we solve this problem we are going to walk in circles if we are
discussing why wiki does not work as we wish; also we are not going
anywhere when we discuss how should metagov be governed.

Can't you see we are subject to the same limitation we are trying to
solve for others. So my position is: no pain, relax, work on what the
real issue is, and don't get frustrated if the wiki is not behaving
like you wish. If it was we wouldn't need to be here :)
