<PRE>Welcome Alvaro,

&gt;<i> &gt; ... rather than arguing about it here, we should be working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together to ensure that personal choices of this kind don't end up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; splitting the voters.  If some of them prefer to participate in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; public, while others prefer to remain anonymous, they should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nevertheless be voting together, side by side.  (Otherwise we'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have split consensus, much as Thomas foresaw.)
</I>

(I think so, though it won't be easy.)

&gt;<i> ... I mean, one of the characteristics of secure voting systems is
</I>&gt;<i> no-coercion, what implies that the voter can't prove what he had
</I>&gt;<i> voted so nobody can force another people to cast a determinated
</I>&gt;<i> vote, or to buy votes. I think that's the main purpose of secret
</I>&gt;<i> voting: evading coercion (and social coercion).
</I>
But you guys keep falling back to an attack on public voting.  There
are several approaches we can take in response:

  a) Defend public voting by rebutting the charges of coercion.  For
     example, see my earlier reply to David:
     <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-May/002866.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-May/002866.html</A>

  b) Defend public voting by asserting its positive benefits.  (It can
     build a communicative structure that is resistant to mass
     manipulations, irrational arguments, and so forth.)

  c) Counterattack by pointing out the wholesale coercions of private,
     mass voting.  (I agree with Kris's points on this.)
 
Maybe (a) is the most direct approach, so please allow me:

What exactly are you and David talking about?  Please describe how an
organization (or individual) would go about coercing the public
voters.  What is the first thing this organization will do?  And how
will it expect the voters to react?
