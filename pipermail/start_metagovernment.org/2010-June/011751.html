<PRE>&gt;<i> Definitely a great proposal. I think I can complete it, because it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't tell yet which &quot;user main page&quot; should be the face of the
</I>&gt;<i> project. Something like www.google.com/websiteoptimizer shows at
</I>&gt;<i> random one of several versions of a page, measuring visitors'
</I>&gt;<i> responses to each one. After some time the tool determines public's
</I>&gt;<i> favorite.
</I>
Yeah, this is very much what I'm proposing -- I see the genetic
algorithm' solutions better than google's however.  IOW, don't just
select a &quot;final version&quot; and eliminate the rest.  Keep them in all in
(lessor/probabilistic) circulation, allowing later improvements that
could bump them up again.  It's definitely a different paradigm, but
it's known to work (wink-wink (they call it evolution)).  (Individual
users could tailor they're own favorites with sticky-votes that would
give them greater preference within their own personal &quot;views&quot;.)

To me, this is the only real way to solve the [information
overload]-[democratic participation] problem.  It is [probably] the
*only* long-term solution. It is *optimal* in the sense that there is
no room for improving it.

(...Damn, I hope I get credit for that....:)
