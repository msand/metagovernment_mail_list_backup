Offer to pay individuals $1, $10 or $100 to vote in a certain way, check 
their public vote and pay them.

Or an employer could suggest employees vote a certain way and check 
their public votes to see if they did. If they didn't they could find a 
reason to fire them or otherwise punish them.

Of course doing these things would be against local laws, but that 
doesn't mean it wouldn't happen.

With a secret vote this can't be effectively done because there is no 
way for a third party to verify how anyone actually voted.

It this stage, I think any software should allow administrators to 
choose between secret and public voting. Public voting isn't really a 
problem with small organization, where the stakes are low.
