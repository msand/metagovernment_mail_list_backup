Votorola uses the drafting model of the common pollwiki (diverse
population of variant documents undergoing continuous mutation and
recombination).  It is close to that of recombinant text.  MixedInk's
is even closer.^[1]  Recombinant text was invented in 2001.^[2]  It's
an evolutionary genetic system that differs from (but is related to)
human-based genetic algorithms (HBGA).  The relations among all
evolutionary genetic systems are outlined here:^[3]

Whitehouse 2 is (I think) evolutionary only in the sense that it
undergoes incremental changes (like almost everything), but with no
relation to the genetic basis of natural populations.  Vilfredo has no
genetics either (right?).  Can it properly be described as an HBGA?

I hope you can try your hand in the pollwiki Mark, maybe joining in
one of the ongoing polls discussed here in the list.  I'm curious to
learn how your evolutionary idea differs from what we've implemented.
Maybe you can help us to improve it.

[1] Votorola has no proper genetics, so it is not properly a
    recombinant text.  However the difference bridge (which I hope we
    can demonstrate fully for you all in the coming days and weeks)
    does add a form of quasi-genetics to the textual transfers.

    On MixedInk as a recombinant text, see here:
