<PRE>Hi all,

I would prefer to call this activity &quot;Open Election&quot; as against &quot;Secure
Voting&quot;. An Open Election system would encompass all aspects of an election
including electioneering, voting, declaration, etc. There should be a
publicly audit-able audit trail for every activity, before during and after
an election. This could be for any public activity.

</I>&gt;<i> when this thread started.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it may be nice to have the capacity to support both anonymous and
</I>&gt;<i> public systems, but in the end public is the goal (I think we all agree on
</I>&gt;<i> that so some extent), so I'd like to see it get into peoples' minds sooner
</I>&gt;<i> rather than later.
