(No hurry.  The tools aren't very inviting/intuitive, yet.)  Forking
is maybe appropriate.  You'll want space to elaborate your own ideas
without me interfering.

Also, I'm voting for you:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!mho">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=Ed-EdpastoreCom&amp;p=G!p!mho</A>

Maybe you and Thomas and I (if nobody else) will be enough to get
things rolling?  All it ever takes (they say) is a small, dedicated
core of leaders.

&gt;<i> So, fork your draft? Would I use
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Ed-EdpastoreCom/G/p/mho">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Ed-EdpastoreCom/G/p/mho</A> ?
</I>
Yes, following the pattern of:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/mho">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/mho</A>

Or just click on 'My position', which works for everybody:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:MyPage/G/p/mho">http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:MyPage/G/p/mho</A>

&gt;<i> And what does that mean, anyway? That is, what do G, p, and mho stand  
</I>&gt;<i> for? Is that Global, plan, and (arbitrary)?
</I>
Ordinary users won't need to worry about this, but here's some
details:

  G

    The name Thomas gave to the global area (for global issues)
    <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G">http://u.zelea.com/w/G</A>

  G/p

    Area G defines its polls (aka issues) as sub-pages named G/p/*.
    The &quot;p&quot; doesn't really stand for anything (maybe poll), and it's
    only a convention.  The specific naming pattern may vary from area
    to area.

  G/p/mho

    The local, in-wiki name that I gave to this particular poll.  The
    final term &quot;mho&quot; is just an identifier.  It's best if it's short,
    and also neutral in regards to the issue.  (I got &quot;mho&quot; from
    &quot;Metagovernment HOme page&quot;.)

More on poll names here: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Category:Poll">http://u.zelea.com/w/Category:Poll</A>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A political manifesto or a software description? For example, Firefox  
</I>&gt;<i> touts how wonderful it is...
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html</A>
</I>
Ghastly. :-)

Not technical, nobody cares about that (very boring).  I mean
political in the controversial sense of being socially divisive.

&gt;<i> We are in a strange position of advocating a sort of political
</I>&gt;<i> ideology within the context of advocating a framework that can suit
</I>&gt;<i> people of any political ideology. In other words... as sort of meta-
</I>&gt;<i> politics. :) We do firmly advocate certain principles like democracy
</I>&gt;<i> and transparency, but take no stand on any particular sociopolitical
</I>&gt;<i> issue.
</I>
Yes, I agree.  Democracy itself is profoundly radical (even
subsversive) in its substance.  We've gotten used to it being safely
buried, even while we see the forms of it (and crucially the name)
flying high and wide.  But this issue of the home page brings out the
substance (at least for me).

&gt;<i> I have always been seeking a way to cede control of
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment.org. Likewise, in Thomas' proposal, he expresses a
</I>&gt;<i> desire to cede freevoters.org. It's just that whichever name we use
</I>&gt;<i> needs some entity to be ceded to. The problem I have chronically
</I>&gt;<i> encountered with Metagovernment is that most entities, in order to
</I>&gt;<i> have any recognition by other institutions (namely governments and
</I>&gt;<i> banks, with which they would have to show legitimacy in order to
</I>&gt;<i> have control over resources) have to have designated, empowered
</I>&gt;<i> leaders. It would be a violation of our own core principles to, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, have me cede metagovernment.org to a formal non-profit
</I>&gt;<i> called Metagovernment which is headed by an elected and empowered
</I>&gt;<i> board of directors.
</I>
We could let the public decide.  The immediate problem is then the
constitution of a caretaker body to own the name, and the terms by
which it dissolves itself in favour of whatever the public eventually
decides.  Thomas and I discussed something like this before, but not
in any detail.  Maybe this is another test issue for the tools?
