<PRE>An interesting event hosted by a friend of mine.

I send it along as an example that the OpenGov stuff is still pretty
down to earth where it matters.

This Thursday, I'm hosting an awesome event with some of NYC's
greatest Government 2.0 minds. If you are interested in the future of
open government in the NYC metro area, this will be the place to learn
all about it. For those of you not in NYC, we'll be posting links to
the live stream on both of the following locations...

Re:Group / In Code We Trust - Exploring models of authorized
participation through crowd sourced democracy in the 21st Century.&#194;
Re:Group: Beyond Models of Consensus, an exhibition which examines
models of participation and participation as a model in art and
activism. Re:Group proposes that with participation now a dominant
paradigm, structuring social interaction, art, activism, the
architecture of the city, and the economy, we are all integrated into
participatory structures whether we want to be or not. The exhibition
showcases work that subverts existing systems or envisions new
alternatives to the ways in which individuals can take part, or choose
not to take part, in social and cultural life.
&quot;In Code We Trust&quot; is the new motto for Government in the 21st
century. Across the country, geeks inside and outside of government
are developing a new participatory and transparent Federal, State and
Municipal governments. Built upon open-source tools, open standards,
and best practices, this panel will highlight authorized actors as
they &#194;&#160;practical examples of initiatives from private, public and
government sectors.
