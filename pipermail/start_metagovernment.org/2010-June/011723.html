<PRE>For the sake of brevity, I'm going to trim significantly, and only  
respond to the most significant points.

I think you may be presenting a workable synthesis here, then. I have  
no objection to a different &quot;door&quot; into the content. I do object to  
the main page saying the project is &quot;needed,&quot; but surely there's still  
room for synthesis there. How about a link somewhere near the top  
saying (something like): &quot;For a geeky philosophical presentation of  
this content, click here.&quot;

&gt;<i> Yes, but if *your* ideas (about what is meaningful, useful, etc.) were

</I>&gt;<i> now about the lack of interest on the website.
</I>
My post was not about a lack of interest.

It was about how when I discuss the project with regular people, they  
say they visit the site and they don't get it. I think that the  
language in your &quot;Why...&quot; page would make that reaction even stronger.  
I believe we need to simplify our approach, not geek it up.

What you and I are identifying are two very different audiences. Yours  
is what you claim is the techno-elite. Mine is the majority of people.  
I think the Main Page should be something that reaches out to the vast  
majority of people. The geeks can find links to geeky content without  
significant help from us.

&gt;&gt;<i> Again, I don't get what you are saying. Who is your audience that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different from mine?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I call them the hidden geek-corps.  And my guess is that you don't
</I>&gt;<i> identify with them much.  It's more engineering than philosophy.  I
</I>&gt;<i> like both, so I'm trying to bridge two levels (and speeds) of
</I>&gt;<i> attention.  I'm not asking you to be both, but give an ability for
</I>&gt;<i> both audiences to have their separate spaces and let it be.
</I>
Just to be clear here, I worked in I.T. for 15 years, and now work in  
internet and social media marketing. I don't think I have trouble  
identifying with geeks (having amply demonstrated membership in their  
ranks). But I do think that the idea of opening up human social  
governance should be made approachable to everyone, not just to the  
geek-elite.

&gt;&gt;<i> And separately, I personally do not think that governance software  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rely on trust.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you tried to run a family without trust?  Without trust, there is
</I>&gt;<i> *NO SYNTHESIS*.  I'm a philosophy guy, too.  Please contemplate this.
</I>
I don't agree at all. Most organizations that need formal governance  
do not have trust. But they can still achieve synthesis.

My classic example is the village that wanted to cut down its local  
forest to exploit the monetary value in the wood, and the opposing  
environmentalists who wanted to protect the apes living in those  
woods. The synthesis was for the environmentalists to help the  
villagers develop an ecotourism business: providing both lasting money  
and lasting protection for the apes. Trust may have been necessary by  
the end of that process, but it was not needed at the beginning. Both  
sides saw a real win out of the synthesis... no trust required.

If we require trust before even attempting synthesis, then we will get  
nothing except solutions to insignificant problems among homogenous  
populations.

&gt;&gt;<i> Governance, politics, and such are about conflict, distrust,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and competing interests. If we simply hope everyone will get along,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do we need governance at all?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) To help us remember ourselves.  2) To resolve historical disputes
</I>&gt;<i> whose resolution has yet to be propagated.
</I>
But... everyone does *not* get along. Hoping doesn't make it true. (A  
synthesis mechanism might, though.)

&gt;&gt;<i> A free software project or a wiki can work on trust because  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is committed to the same end. In Wikipedia, conflict is a subset of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meta-goal of dispassionate description. So even if there is intense
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disagreement over something, it can be subsumed with a statement that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> describes that conflict and dispassionately states both sides of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it. But in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance, there is no unified objective. At least not until an  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reached synthesis. To rely on trust in governance is to be prey to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ethical participants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I know your point well, but you could just as well say that
</I>&gt;<i> putting trust in automated solutions is prey to those who will &quot;game
</I>&gt;<i> the system&quot; (unless the very leader/maintainer of the system
</I>&gt;<i> him/herself is Trusted (and then will THAT last over century?
</I>&gt;<i> Remember this problem is over 2000 yrs old.))
</I>
Yes. We've already discussed on this list a simple solution. Well, it  
is technically difficult to implement, but the idea is very simple: to  
have no single administrator. Instead I propose we eventually have  
multiple, redundant, distributed admins. Each one is check-summed by  
all the others, so any implementation which deviates from the trusted  
trunk is deprecated from the aggregate &quot;administration.&quot;

&gt;<i> Anyway, like the geek-corps already figured out, forking is to be
</I>&gt;<i> encouraged.  Merging/synthesis will happen later.  It's the old fogies
</I>&gt;<i> who haven't figured it out yet, --but the tools must support it.  (I
</I>&gt;<i> think you have noticed the rise in distributed software revision
</I>&gt;<i> sytems like git, etc.?)
</I>
Right, as I say above, I propose a distributed system that goes  
further than any current cloud in that it distributes administration  
to an unlimited number of authoritative but independent admins who  
cross-check each other.

But if you are talking in terms of the project, then by all means fork  
it. As I noted, your pages do not seem to be getting interest from  
other current members of this group. Feel free to start another one  
with &quot;your people.&quot; I will even support a &quot;second trunk.&quot; That is, a  
second version of the wiki, or a different branch of the wiki that  
operates in tandem with the one oriented toward regular folk.  
Alternately, you might just want to put your effort into developing  
Candiwi, which is, after all, the original geek-branch of this project.
