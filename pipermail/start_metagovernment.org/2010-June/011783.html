Just as an aside, this is the basis of how Metagovernment has always  
been organized.

Admins are listed:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Metagovernment:Community_Portal#Administrators">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Metagovernment:Community_Portal#Administrators</A>
(though I guess that page needs some updating).

And earlier instances of the website which referenced a controlling  
organization also provided terms for supercession. For example, this  
is from the first edition of the website from March, 2007:

&quot;The initial nonprofit institutions are to be viewed as transient and  
goal-oriented. Each institution will incorporate into its bylaws a  
part of its associated wiki, referred to as a continuing resolution.  
That continuing resolution can amend the bylaws as necessary, and can  
also cease continuance. In the latter case, the institution is then  
required by its bylaws to dissolve itself.&quot;
