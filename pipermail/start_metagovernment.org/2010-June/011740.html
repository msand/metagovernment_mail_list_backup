Yes, we have reached the point, where we can actually do e-democracy. So 
yes, lets do it! On the other hand, there are people e.g. on this list 
who would like to contribute to this process. And here is the question 
for me: How do we organize ourselves? In a non-profit organization or a 
Limited Liability Partnership or ... ? It would for example be much 
better if such an organization was the owner of the domains than just 
you and I.

@conditions of ownership:
&gt;<i> If we can reach consensus on this, then we can host the common 
</I>&gt;<i> pollwiki/streetwiki (and what not) under the new domain name. For my 
</I>&gt;<i> part, I can't see letting anybody but the public decide the ultimate 
</I>&gt;<i> ownership and name (with only an interim caretaker, till the public 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;comes of age&quot;). 
</I>
Ok, so I started a poll: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/owdo">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/owdo</A>

&gt;<i> Online discussions are largely Steven Clift's initiative.  I'm keen to follow his lead.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I agree, his e-democracy discussion lists seem to be ideal to connect with.

@Homepage:
&gt;<i> Do you (or Ed) disagree with my proposed format? I started the poll 
</I>&gt;<i> with minimal content, so that we could reach a rough consensus on the 
</I>&gt;<i> format, first. If the format differs too widely between voter and 
</I>&gt;<i> candidate, then the tools don't work so well; there's not much 
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative drafting, and not much to discuss.
</I>
I like both yours and Ed's formats. For me, the content is not 
disturbing for the question of the format. The homepage is not my first 
priority right now though.

Best,
Thomas
