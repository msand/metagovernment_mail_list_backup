True.

&gt;<i> But we could play on your idea with terms such as &quot;real democracy&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> everyone else calls &quot;democracy&quot; is a poor imitation. And that really
</I>&gt;<i> sums it up nicely, doesn't it?
</I>
Beautious!  I agree, it would only be a teaser to say, &quot;Our aim is
democracy&quot;, unless we followed it up with &quot;real democracy.&quot;  That's
perfect.  (&quot;Bond&quot;, he says, &quot;James Bond.&quot;)
 
&gt;<i> As an aside, in looking up &quot;Cooperative&quot; in Wikipedia, I came across
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;participatory democracy,&quot; which seems like a good match as well:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy</A> (Though note
</I>&gt;<i> that I had participated in editing this article a couple years ago,
</I>&gt;<i> which may explain why it sounds somewhat like me speaking.:)
</I>
So participatory democracy is the *means*, and real democracy is the
*end*.  This makes it especially clear what we're talking about.  (And
participatory democracy is a foundation of Frankfurt critical theory
too, so we know we're well grounded.)

&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe it's time for some reconnaissance?  I guess we could do it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either individually, or in small scouting teams. (If anyone wants
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to join me, I know a few places to explore - and maybe we can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think of others along the way.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a great plan and something that every member of this list
</I>&gt;<i> can easily participate in (though I will have trouble doing so very
</I>&gt;<i> actively for another couple of months). The next step here probably
</I>&gt;<i> would be to draft a basic set of suggestions for what list members
</I>&gt;<i> can do to progress this objective.
</I>
Maybe we can tag our progress reports under #recce:

&gt;<i> Anyone care to take a stab?
</I>
I just jumped in (trying to learn the ropes).  It could be fun:
