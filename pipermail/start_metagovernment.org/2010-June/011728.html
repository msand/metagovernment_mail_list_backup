<PRE>*unlurks*

I would like to add a couple of points to the discussion on approachability,
having found a some time to catch up on the recent mailing list activity.

1) People don't get it.

I've been following this project for a couple of years and often pointed
people to the page or described it to them personally. In almost every case,
the person strongly disagrees that the idea of a government in which anyone
can directly participate would work. The reasons why they disagree are all
problems which are being or have been addressed in the mailing list
discussion. However, I've found when discussing these proposed solutions
with people that they are reluctant to reassess their immediate evaluation:
&quot;it will never work&quot;.

This leads me to believe that some knowledge of and reflection on some of
the basic concepts (e.g. radical transparency, a decentralised
organisation) is required for most people before they have the desired
reaction (&quot;let's do it!&quot;) to the concept of collaborative government.

In short, they take the single idea of collaboration: &quot;everyone can take
part&quot; and transpose it onto their idea of how governance works at the
moment, and conclude &quot;it won't work&quot; (because of x,y,z...).

I can therefore only support the proposal to make the main page as simple as
possible and to try to accomplish some of this basic groundwork by
introducing the most important concepts.

2) Appealing to geeks and other users

Markus raises an important point about appealing to &quot;his&quot; users. It may be
that people participating in metagovernment have different ideas about how
to present the project, why it is important, the best approach to take etc..
And each of these people may be able to attract more new users by appealing
specifically to those who have a similar knowledge background/participate in
the same communities etc..

Perhaps a solution to this could be *user* pages where people present the
project from their own point of view and with like-minded potential users in
mind. Or is this something that metagovernment users should do within the
other communities they are active in, with a view to capturing people's
interest and *then* directing them to meatgovernment.org?
