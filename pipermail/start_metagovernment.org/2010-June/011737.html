<PRE>Thomas and I spoke off list, but I'll add my voice here.

For the most part, I think these doors are all closed (details further
below).  It was always your initiative to bring projects/organizations
together, and I don't regret having followed you.  It's given us an
open architecture, for example.  But now we're stalled.  Wherever we
go we meet with closed doors.  Developers and organizers are too
intent on protecting their turf (naturally), so they can't open up.

I think it's time to change tack.  Instead of focusing on the
meta-stuff - building tools and organizations for e-democracy - I
think we should focus on doing e-democracy itself.  On this path, we
are far from the leaders.  E-democracy is already out there and
happening.  For example, here's a community of ordinary people who are
already engaged with the political issues that matter to them:
<A HREF="http://forums.e-democracy.org/groups/mpls/messages/topics.html">http://forums.e-democracy.org/groups/mpls/messages/topics.html</A>

Where else do you see anything like that?  That's the question I'm
asking in these threads:

  Good quality online deliberation.

  Where are local issues discussed?

  Where can e-democracy start?
  <A HREF="http://groups.dowire.org/r/topic/29jMfcqD5sp6ibfjEWwY3M">http://groups.dowire.org/r/topic/29jMfcqD5sp6ibfjEWwY3M</A>

Online discussions are largely Steven Clift's initiative.  I'm keen to
follow his lead.

&gt;<i> @1. the straw poll Mike started is sufficient for that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> @2. the old frvp-poll is probably the best place for this. So I
</I>&gt;<i> brought my position up to date:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/G/p/frvp">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/G/p/frvp</A>
</I>
Neither of these has gone anywhere.  Only you and I have active
positions, and they're miles apart (building tools vs. building an
organizations!)  Now that we have the tools, I think we need to do
e-democracy.  I think we need to do it *before* we talk about
organizing it.

&gt;<i> @3. that depends on 2. If it was a Limited Liability Partnership
</I>&gt;<i> like David proposes, the domains would simply be its property, I
</I>&gt;<i> guess.  Otherwise we might think of giving the ownership to the
</I>&gt;<i> general public at some point. Ofc in both cases the owners would
</I>&gt;<i> decide through our tools. Should we start a poll on this too?
</I>
If we can reach consensus on this, then we can host the common
pollwiki/streetwiki (and what not) under the new domain name.  For my
part, I can't see letting anybody but the public decide the ultimate
ownership and name (with only an interim caretaker, till the public
&quot;comes of age&quot;).  So this issue wouldn't depend on 1 and 2.  We
(caretakers) could reach a separate consensus on this, alone.

&gt;<i> @4. Here is the poll (I added Ed's position):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/mho">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/mho</A>
</I>
You weren't here Thomas, but see our last on this:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-June/002932.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-June/002932.html</A>

Do you (or Ed) disagree with my proposed format?  I started the poll
with minimal content, so that we could reach a rough consensus on the
format, first.  If the format differs too widely between voter and
candidate, then the tools don't work so well; there's not much
collaborative drafting, and not much to discuss.

Welcome back to the fray, ;-)
