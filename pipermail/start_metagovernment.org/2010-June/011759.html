You make an excellent point. But there is still the great potential  
for confusion when using the word e-democracy. We can hope that we can  
overtake the other meanings simply because our idea is brighter. But  
at the moment, there are a *lot* of people interested in the  
conventional meaning of e-democracy. There is a tremendous slope to  
climb. S when you ask others what can be done to make e-democracy  
happen, I imagine that most of them are not thinking what you are  
thinking.

But again, your point about using &quot;democracy&quot; is reasonable. That  
still leaves many other possibilities:

Open democracy
Collaborative democracy
Internet democracy
iDemocracy ;)
Democratic governance
Universal democracy
Direct e-democracy
Inclusive democracy
Electronic direct democracy (in Wikipedia)

I'm sure others can think of more.

&gt;<i> It is also a technical prerequisite for *e*-democracy.  The tools of
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy cannot conjure discussion/dialogue out of thin air (we see
</I>&gt;<i> no examples of that).  So they can only be effective (it appears) when
</I>&gt;<i> they are used by healthy communities, already engaged with political
</I>&gt;<i> issues, and so forth.
</I>
But doesn't that apply to communities of interest about anything other  
than democracy? That is, wouldn't we have better traction in an  
existing online community where people have a deep interest in their  
core topic area, but no way to govern themselves other than through  
the actions of an individual or a few representatives.
