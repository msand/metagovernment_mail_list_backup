Sorry about the confusion.  I try to make it clearer here:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/mho">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/mho</A>

  This is a poll to compose a home page for the umbrella organization
  under which the facilities of e-democracy are to be hosted. The name
  of the organization has yet to be agreed (it could be Metagovernment
  or Freevoters or anything). In the meantime, we simply call it the
  &quot;umbrella organization&quot;.

Ed wants the facilities hosted under the name Metagovernment.  Can we
reach a rough consensus on the home page?  On ownership of the domain
name?  On the name itself?  If we can, (IMHO) e-democracy starts here.

&gt;<i> Would it be correct to say that Votorola is the focus of activity, in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of working on tools, of the people on this list? What about
</I>&gt;<i> Candiwi?
</I>
The technical focus is supposed to be on the common infrastructure,
which in turn is centered on the pollwiki/streetwiki.  You won't see
Votorola in there.  Votorola is just a provider of plug-in services
(pollserver, trustserver, difference bridge) at the periphery.
Candiwi is invited to plug into the periphery too, as an alternative
pollserver.  We could then cross-mirror the votes, enabling the users
to free-range between the two pollservers.

&gt;<i> The reason I ask is that I'm not sure I agree with Votorola's basic
</I>&gt;<i> principle of nominating candidates, so I don't know if that's the best
</I>&gt;<i> place for me to add my input.
</I>
Is Candiwi capable of building consensus on the issue of a home page?
Even if the developers don't want to plug into the commons (for
whatever reason), we could still compare the two architectures side by
side.

Otherwise, you could vote temporarilly with Votorola, while at the
same time helping us to locate other voting tools/projects that are
ripe for plugging into the commons.  We want the voters to have a wide
choice of facilities.

&gt;<i> But yes, please change my username in any case.
</I> 
It's now Psabin-GmailCom (same password).
