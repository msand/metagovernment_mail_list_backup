<PRE>I met with Matias yesterday night. He went through the whole presentation as
if he was actually presenting. I have to say it looked and sounded really
good. Matias was trying to get a friend of his a press credential in order
to tape the talk. It will be in Spanish so we might add some subtitles
after.

Regarding the closing phrase, I really like it, and Matias makes the
clarification that we got in a point in history where technology is a TOOL
that enables us to propose massive collaborative democracy as an option, but
it's up to us to make that work. It was a real nice closing and I wouldn't
change it.

I proposed for an initial impact to open with this reflection:
- How many times have you criticized a government/directory/council?
- How many times did you do anything to actually change what you were
criticizing?
- How many times did you have/know the way to actually do something about
it?
- How many times did you think whatever you did would just make no
difference?

I absolutely agree that a live tour through the projects would be real nice.
Matias, I know you have laptop issues so let me know if you want to borrow
mine.

Good Luck!!

Juan

&gt;<i> I love it too, aand I think it should be included in our wiki. In fact
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should hae a sort of standard presentation to start with
</I>&gt;<i> that everybody can use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few points:
</I>&gt;<i> you speak about direct democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> In a question recently on Vilfredo the agreement was found that the
</I>&gt;<i> term &quot;collaborative democracy&quot; was a really good way to express what
</I>&gt;<i> we are trying to do. Consider inserting it somwhere.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=53">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=53</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of a group of organizations, consider calling us an &quot;umbrella&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> organization. I think this is the key word when we are speaking about
</I>&gt;<i> organization of organizations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again there was a question on what can a non programmer do to help in
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment. The answer was quite long. I will not repeat tha
</I>&gt;<i> answer, but it was very detailed. You might find other ideas there
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=59">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=59</A>   (It was really long and
</I>&gt;<i> full of possibilities)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking about Vilfredo, I am happy that we are included, even though
</I>&gt;<i> the project is so young. The homepage you used is not really the key
</I>&gt;<i> page. This is something I need to do from a long time. If you could
</I>&gt;<i> instead use a screenshot from <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php</A>
</I>&gt;<i> it would be much easier for people to understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would also probably add two slides from the metagov page:
</I>&gt;<i> one with the list of similar projects. This because one of the reason
</I>&gt;<i> why people met us was because of this list. It is quite comprehensive
</I>&gt;<i> (and yes we need to contact them more. The italian ones are on my todo
</I>&gt;<i> list!)
</I>&gt;<i> the second page I would add is the list of projects. And I would add
</I>&gt;<i> that as an introduction to the presentation of the projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I sometimes do, if I have internet connection, is to go to those
</I>&gt;<i> places LIVE during the presentation. It has a differen feeling. Like
</I>&gt;<i> going to a river instead of seeing a picture of it. And people realise
</I>&gt;<i> this is really a place they can go to. Just keep a screenshot in case
</I>&gt;<i> the website is down just on that day. Also as you do this they will
</I>&gt;<i> SEE how they are connected: ok from the homepage he has clicked on the
</I>&gt;<i> list of projects on the side. Ok, so here are all the projects, and
</I>&gt;<i> this was the one I was interested... and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a last slide I would add a slide with only a big thank you, your
</I>&gt;<i> name and the metagovernment.org In the middle. This will help them in
</I>&gt;<i> focusing on what they need to remember.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can get them just to scribble down the term metagovernment.org
</I>&gt;<i> you have done a great work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am now wondering what possibilities would thre be to make a video or
</I>&gt;<i> at least an MP3 of the presentation. Before video where so common, I
</I>&gt;<i> remember someone making a n mp3 where he just would say, &quot;next slide&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> when it was time. The result was that you could follow the talk having
</I>&gt;<i> the slides and the mp3. But really, if you have a friend that attends,
</I>&gt;<i> with a camera, consider asking him to record the talk. Just make sure
</I>&gt;<i> the camera can sustain the whole length of the talk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best of luck!
</I>&gt;<i> We are all supporting you!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is an excellent presentation, Mat&#237;as. Very well thought out. I think

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will play well for the Wikimania crowd.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My only suggestion would be to please include Candiwi in the screenshots.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The current site is still a somewhat early version (Manuel, Fabe, et al.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could you push up the latest version?), but it at least should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; represented. It is a descendent of Metascore, after all. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good luck!
