<PRE>Thanks everybody for this great topic.

Let me share some of the thoughts I have been mulling over those last days.
Because I feel that the problem is deeper, much deeper than that.

The problem is that we usually consider laws to be pretty much
unrelated on to the other. As if you could vote one up and the other
down. But often laws are related to each other. And when you vote one
up, you automatically need to vote the other down. So essentially you
need to vote a whole set of laws up, respect to a whole set of laws
down.

Essentially those laws are entangled. Much like quantum particles ;-).

Let this mull over, while I introduce something else:
We all know about laws and about the constitution. Essentially the
constitution gives us the base on which we can build laws, and give us
some general boundaries, telling us what laws can be done, and what
cannot be done.

And in every nation there are ways to change the constitution, and
this is always harder than changing the individual laws. More than
that, changing a law does not force a change in the constitution
constitution. But what happens when you change the constitiotion?
Although I am no expert my guess is that laws should then change, and
what in practical terms happen, is that laws remain the same, but the
first time someone tries to appy a law that is against the
constitution the law can be made invalid.

(I am really here shooting in the dark, but am I correct to say that
in the US you have different levels of justice, and once it reaches
supreme court, the supreme court can declare if a law is against the
constitution?)

In any case it is clear that, you change a rule at the constitution
level, and boom... all those lower level laws change. And there are
more than just two levels. I mean you have constitution, laws, and
then you have set of regulations (for example that regulates a
condominium), and those have to abide to the law, and if the law
change, the rules have to change. And if the constitution changes,
this generates changes in the laws, that make changes in the rules,
that might make changes further down (for example, the TV time for the
kids, in a house can change if the condominium rules require silence
at a certain time, etc).

So you have here a sort of top-down entaglement.

You don't change the laws to change the constitution, but you do
change the constitution having an effect at the law level.

This is essentially why we don't want our prime principles (which in a
sense is even above the constitution) to change too much.

We don't want to develop a laws following a set of principles, and
then change the principles, and be in a system which is in contrast
with itself.

SO what is the solution?

I don't know.

One solution would be to give to each principle its oun wiki page, and
link to it every time we apply it. If anyone wants to change that they
MUST make sure that we are not getting into any contraddiction with
the existing rules. Or have to first provide alternative rules.

Another idea (and this is the direction I am thinking right now), is
that each rule sits womwhere in a sort of pyramidal structure. On top
you have (few key) principles. Lower down middle principle. And so on.
Essentially we already have this as we have principles that we apply
to all of MG projects, and others that apply only to some projects.
Every change of principle will be stir a conversation in all the
people involved in the principles, rules, laws and regulations below
that. But to do this we need to have a seroious
metascore-vilfredo-something program that can let us find a sinthesis.


Maybe we could merge the two ideas together, and each rule will have
to link on all the laws that are more general to those law. We are
here throwing away the discreete levels at all. We don't have anymore,
principles, constitution, laws, but just laws, with some laws being
above others. Well you cannot change a law unless you deal with all
the las below. Deal how? Well, that's the big deal.

making them invalid; producing alternate versions to switch to;
checking that they are not against the new laws.

And if each law has a wiki page, each person registers for each change
in each law-page they are interested in, whoever want sot change a
principle would need to contact so many people that no one could
change the principles, unless the whole community agrees.

hmmmmm, hmmmmm, hmmmmm

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi, Mark.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I welcome your participation and also your dissent over the edit policy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The justification for the edit policy on the Main Page is that it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extremely public-facing. People who visit our project often only view the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main page, and the impression they get from there may be all they get. If it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is off-kilter for half a day, that's a bunch of people that see something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which does not represent the project. I know it doesn't seem like the wiki
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way to have something be somewhat restricted, but consider that Wikipedia's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Main Page is not even editable at all. The use of an alternate page as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mat&#237;as linked it a viable workaround that allows people to work on an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improvement without losing the current version which is known to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for the Basic Principles... it just seems reasonable that our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamental principles should not be particularly malleable, otherwise we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lose our integrity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said... note that the pages in question are not protected by other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than policy. Only the Copyright page is protected against editing, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it wouldn't be nice for someone to suddenly change the legal statement about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the availability of the content. If you really think a page needs to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changed, you are still free to do so. For example, people have fixed typos
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and made other small edits from time to time. The main objection I have is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about changing the tone or general idea of the Main Page without using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> established suggested-page method.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In any event... welcome to the group. It looks like you've been keeping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite busy on the wiki. :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There's a bunch of other stuff I'd like to dialog about, but will hold
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> off for now and let the conversation continue via wiki edits....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note that while we do engage in dialog through the wiki, this list server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is often the more active method. For more complicated conversations, it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> often helpful to hash them out in this venue, then to codify and refine them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the wiki.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. The UCSC trust mechanism sounds fantastic. Do you have a link? I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> traveling today so don't know when I'll be able to look at it, but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainly sounds worth considering.
