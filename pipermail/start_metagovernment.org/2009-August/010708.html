<PRE>Tal,

Thank you for sharing your projects with us. I will try to find time to read
a little bit more about them, but it all looks pretty exciting. Specially
that you already have contact with the local government and you are being
heard.

Congrats on the results of your efforts and I'm looking forward to reading
the development of your actions :)

Thanks,

Juan Alvarez

&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My name is Tal, and I am from the Israeli direct democracy movement. I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to introduce to you our projects and area of intrest. I can
</I>&gt;<i> elaborate more on projects and topics that you will find interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We started our group in January 2008. we have done research on the problems
</I>&gt;<i> of represntetives democracy and tryed to get femiliar with diffrent stiles
</I>&gt;<i> of direct democracy (In Athen, Switzerland the USA, and anarchists groups) ,
</I>&gt;<i> and we sarched for ways to bring direct democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We found out the ways and reasons for the control of unselcted oligarchies
</I>&gt;<i> on the represntatives democracy. and then we strated to think how can we
</I>&gt;<i> take from them the power, in install it in the people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> we found out that the main reason for oligarchic control is because small
</I>&gt;<i> groups with allot of resources can coordinate themselves and take collective
</I>&gt;<i> action much easily then large groups without extra resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We therefore set several initiative that will enable the people to act
</I>&gt;<i> together much better.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We have one project that is called *Ecllesia &lt;<A HREF="http://bit.ly/ecclesia">http://bit.ly/ecclesia</A>&gt; (in
</I>&gt;<i> development)*, which is built by the Django community in Israel. It should
</I>&gt;<i> be an extended facebook, which will let huge groups to debate, and find out
</I>&gt;<i> way to cooperate as a hall. it is based on a method of arguing, that will
</I>&gt;<i> enable large audiences to get in easy way to an agreement.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Another project is Called OpenKnesst, which will be much like the
</I>&gt;<i> TheyWorkForYou project. It's aim is to make the parliamentary work much more
</I>&gt;<i> transparent. and will let the citizens what their MPs are really doing :-)
</I>&gt;<i> This we hope will make the MPs more obligate to the public that selected
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. WebActivism (webactivism.info) - it is a group of people that created
</I>&gt;<i> web2.0 based campaigns. it will help new people run there own campaigns. we
</I>&gt;<i> hope though to make the the public more powerful in meaningful and
</I>&gt;<i> influential campaigns.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. a group for advisors for democracy. The aim of the group is to help
</I>&gt;<i> communities get organize, and work democratically. it advise them how to
</I>&gt;<i> influence the local government, and how to create a democratic culture. we
</I>&gt;<i> believe that this will create the cultural base for real grass-root
</I>&gt;<i> democracy. We have done allot of research in this area, and we are now
</I>&gt;<i> experimenting in a real communities. so far it is going quite nicely and
</I>&gt;<i> have a good influence on the local government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have more projects in our mind, which we think can strengthen the
</I>&gt;<i> citizens, but some had failed and some we didn't get to them yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have any questions, or disagreement, please let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Tal, The Israeli direct democracy movement (kol1.org/wiki - in Hebrew)
