This reminds me: some idea on post-count filtering of the results were
posted a few months ago.  Basically the viewer decides which
authentication method/level is sufficient for her purposes, and the
votes are filtered and re-counted for her (effectively).
 
&gt;<i> One observation observation made by a friend of mine is that the thing our

</I>&gt;<i> If you have registration at this group level it reinforces the local nodes

</I>
If I understand, this would mix voter representation (group) with that
of voter authentication (same group)?

&gt;<i> the best administrative backbone is to have these groups running an
</I>&gt;<i> established open source groupware (shall we list them in the wiki). devs can

</I>
This might not be sufficient for a fully authenticated (single vote,
no sock puppets, no bots) decision system.  From a technical point of
view, we must tackle the authentication problem head on (at level 3).
Otherwise, if the votes/decisions can be fabricated, there is no point
in developing the system.  What would it prove?
