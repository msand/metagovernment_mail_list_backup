<PRE>Hi,

I have spent a bunch of money to have this Word Press web site created (an
incredible format for this type of a movement). I would like to donate it to
Meta-Government <A HREF="http://thinkuniversallyactglobally.com/bbpress/">http://thinkuniversallyactglobally.com/bbpress/</A>
if I could have a few of my questions answered first.

What kind of 'governance platform' is Meta Govt. going to create? I noticed
this quote from Ed Pastore....*''MixedInk has some good momentum. From my
perspective they would be welcome to join the meta-group. But overall, they
don't seem to be building a platform for governance, are they?*''

I understand that a group of people must write voter questions in order for
Meta Govt. to function, but to what extent of governance is the group
interested in holding? What kinds of other (if any) executive power would
the &quot;governance group&quot; have aside from query/polling the public? Does
everyone in the START group going to have the right to create voter
questions for the public to answer?

Also, is there a way I can get these questions answered on a site or does
every new person figure out what's going on by reading up on the past notes
from this forum?

Could you email me directly just this one time (and in the future,
my conversations will be posted in the forum, correct)?

I will give you the administrative access information to my web site so you
can go about posting questions once I am a little more familiar with the
Meta Govt. core values.

Can we create a mission statement together or do you like the one I posted
on there (It's pretty radical:~)?

Thanks,
Julianna
