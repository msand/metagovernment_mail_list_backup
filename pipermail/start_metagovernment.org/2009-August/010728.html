</I>&gt;<i> Yes, agree much. meta data such as group, group's url, authentification

the vote so you have the most informative set of data possible, which the
web developers can add value to, of course.




&gt;<i> &gt; One observation observation made by a friend of mine is that the thing
</I>&gt;<i> our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democracy sorely lacks is a level between our elected representatives and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individual voters. There is a breakdown in accountability between the
</I>&gt;<i> person
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who (supposedly) represents 100,000 and the single voter.  So hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e-democracy is something that is amenable to and easily adopted by those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; local groups, residents associations, tenants associations, churches,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you have registration at this group level it reinforces the local
</I>&gt;<i> nodes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and networks and local leaders of those nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I understand, this would mix voter representation (group) with that
</I>&gt;<i> of voter authentication (same group)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

the assumption here is that there is no IT solution for sock puppets.
Creating sock puppets is essentially what modern partisan politics and
modern marketing do highly effectively (many people distributing same
message) - can't prevent or detect that. I also suspect that lacking a huge
elections bureacracy (like the one that exists now to authenticate voters) -
multiple voting and userids per person is not preventable.  IT should focus
solely on bots and preserving privacy, right?

given those two huge &quot;security holes&quot; group affiliation is the fallback, and
since groups have it in their self interest to have a reputation, the groups
can authentiucate for themselves what the system cannot. &quot;anonynous&quot; or
groupless votes can be accepted of course but are near-to-worthless in a
decision making process.

this system would allow of course for groups that are nothing but
verification agencies - quite like an experian or equifax for democracy.
(want to start a business?)


ideally the group should have a secure identifying key for each memberID so
the hardest part then is having a secure method to authenticate Mr. A Smith
is indeed a member of the Omaha Pipefitters Local 345 when he votes on a
facebook app put there by some candidate in a ward election. (Can openID do
this for us?)

so all around i would argue that fighting to secure groupIDs is much more
important than individual voter authentification. groups will have
reputations much more so than individual voters. If you know that the 30% of
the votes in an online poll come from the pipefitters, that tells you a more
about the bias of a poll than almost anything else. most voters will have a
participation rate that is too spotty to infer anything from.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the best administrative backbone is to have these groups running an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; established open source groupware (shall we list them in the wiki). devs
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get those installs to talk to each other in the ways that we need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This might not be sufficient for a fully authenticated (single vote,
</I>&gt;<i> no sock puppets, no bots) decision system.  From a technical point of
</I>&gt;<i> view, we must tackle the authentication problem head on (at level 3).
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, if the votes/decisions can be fabricated, there is no point
</I>&gt;<i> in developing the system.  What would it prove?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

If we define &quot;unfabricated&quot; as:

a legitimate expression of individual self interest by an informed and
eligible voter,  acting on their own behalf and entirely without influence
from or consideration of outside parties actions or interests.

most votes and voters fail this strict definition. we are all sock puppets
now.

so the hardest question is then is

disgruntledgenius321 of the omaha pipefitters is not the same actual person
as

disgruntledgenius123 of the omaha cornhuskers.


and if she was - who has the right to know that?
