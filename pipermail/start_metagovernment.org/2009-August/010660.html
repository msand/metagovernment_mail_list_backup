</I>

Regardless of what you think of what follows, we wouldn't want you to 'waste
your time...'


&gt;<i> To some degree my decision will be based upon whether the folks
</I>&gt;<i> involved in that effort share my interest in *open data*.  So far the
</I>&gt;<i> impression I have received is that they do not, or that at least it is not
</I>&gt;<i> as big a priority for them as it is to me.
</I>

We fully concur that the need to complete forms etc to participate in
processes is not optimal and it is as a result of this that we are in the
process of working towards the development of a distributed architecture
that would eliminate this need. Take a quick look through the recent
discussion threads and you'll see that we are working through the nitty
gritty. Unfortunately the issues are complex and the solution won't be
developed without a coordinated effort that will take some time.

The architectural methodology that is evolving for the platform that we will
develop will not involve very robust meta structure about organizations and
projects in the way that you are working on the problem. We are working more
on creating an open information and interaction space that will be defined
by certain syntactic structures that facilitate communication and
interaction, and where the community of practice makes the links.

As you will see if you take a close look at the documentation, I have been
quite vigorously defending the need for top-down, hierarchical ontology in
order to satisfy our the requirements of the OK Community of Practice. My
argument can be found at: <A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/OK_Ontological">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/OK_Ontological</A>_
Considerations

On the flip side, there has been a strong push to think about a completely
different way of information processing that does not categorize information
from the top-down in a hierarchical manner. This argument is best summarized
by Clay Shirky in the following piece: <A HREF="http://www.shirky.com/">http://www.shirky.com/</A>
writings/ontology_overrated.html

The most recent proposal has been advanced by Tav. Details can be found at:
<A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Tent_as_advanced_by_Tav_on_Aug_14_2009">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Tent_as_advanced_by_Tav_on_Aug_14_2009</A>

The discussion continues...

Given the direction things are going it is unlikely that we will adopt a
framework with a robust top-down structure similar to the framework that
StratML is developing.

 Suresh, do you and your openkollab colleagues have any plans to document
and

&gt;<i> share your mission, vision, values, goals, objectives, and stakeholders on
</I>&gt;<i> the public Web in an open format like StratML?
</I>

We will, in time, share all of the above according to whatever framework we
evolve internally. At this stage both the mission, vision etc.... are in
development as well as the framework so all of this is a bit premature for
us.


&gt;<i> If so, is the group inclined
</I>&gt;<i> to document a value supporting open data?  As you may recall, I have posted
</I>&gt;<i> your &quot;second round&quot; draft in StratML format at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/OK.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/OK.xml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I do not intend to maintain the StratML collection indefinitely.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#StratPlans">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#StratPlans</A>  After AIIM and ANSI have
</I>&gt;<i> approved the standard, hopefully, organizations like yours will begin to
</I>&gt;<i> realize the importance of open data and begin maintaining their own plans
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> StratML format.
</I>

Interesting. I just looked at the listing (fyi for others... scroll down to
the bottom). Can you let me now how that particular listing was developed -
the exact source of that content. Also, precisely how this content is mapped
to organizations that might be of value to us.

Understanding this will bring to bear on our top-down versus syntactic
linking debate.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I do not share the value that you and your colleagues place on
</I>&gt;<i> real-time communications.  Having spent my 34-year career being subjected
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> such communications, I sincerely believe there are better ways to convey
</I>&gt;<i> information and to accomplish shared objectives in most instances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There's no need to debate this. We just believe that RT interaction in
certain instances provides the opportunity to interact with others in a
different way that contributes to trust formation and relationship
development which is necessary for forming virtual teams, obviously. This is
so because synchronous communication most closely resembles actual human
interaction. It is why you if you really want to date someone you move from
online communication to telephone calls...

Anyway, let me know if you have any further questions.
