<PRE>It will be interesting to see what kind of creative solutions can be used to
address this problem -- <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry</A>
-- but participants in this group, as well as the ways that others may
devise to try to defeat them.

However, it seems to me that what truly matters is not how one &quot;votes&quot;, how
many *times* one votes, or how one is &quot;rated&quot; by others (i.e., one's
&quot;reputation&quot;) but, rather, the quality and quantity of contributions to
shared objectives.  If that is the measure, it seems that creating multiple
personalities would become self-defeating over the long run.

For example, it matters little if we all &quot;vote&quot; to schedule a Metagov
conference.  What matters is who does what to make it happen and,
ultimately, what contributions such a conference may make to other,
longer-term goals (e.g., fostering usage of applications/services enabling
individuals to work more efficiently and effectively together in the pursuit
of other, &quot;bigger&quot; (more important) shared objectives in the future).

This is similar to the technique Manuel and Pietro had come up with a  
while ago: that the software can evaluate a user's cloud of influence:  
ie, which users are rating that user and vice-versa. If it is found  
that, for example, a whole group of &quot;users&quot; are giving each other high  
rankings, but almost nobody outside that group is rating any of those  
users, then the software can collapse them all into one person.

Of course, in larger-scaled instances, this gets more complicated as  
one might have many different people using sock puppets with each  
other, but the basic idea should still convey.
