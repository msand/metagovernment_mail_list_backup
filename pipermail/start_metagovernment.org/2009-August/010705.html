<PRE>Hi Owen, thanks for answering.
So will you be attending?

I don't think we can reasonably require all the gov people to share
everything they hear. Everything they say, maybe more so. But the
other way around would be like asking them to always keep a camera
mounted over their glasses. The result of this would be that no one
who is happy to be on the web would refuse to speak with them. I am
not sure if this is what we want.

I agree that people are allowed to make (nearly!) any club they want.
But the club are also meaningful depending on what they are
discussing. If the aim is to discuss world politics, and you do this
in a closed club, where either by economic filtering or other ways you
only permit people like you to be inside... well this is not always
ok. You are essentially discussing how to change the world. And since
you are not allowing the rest of the world to participate this is a
manipulative situation. Sure is generally not illegal (mostly
depending on the means, but also on the country). But weather the
means I cannot see myself supporting it.

</I>&gt;<i> Fenizio
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Tuesday, August 25, 2009 9:41 AM
</I>&gt;<i> To: Metagovernment Startup Committee
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Start] gov 2.0 conferences
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you all seen:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.oreilly.com/gov2009/public/register">https://en.oreilly.com/gov2009/public/register</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this is a gov2.0 conference in the US.
</I>&gt;<i> I think it was organised (but not sponsored) by O'Reilly. The cost to
</I>&gt;<i> participate is extreemely high.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, seriously, even through the Uni this cost high even compared
</I>&gt;<i> to other conferences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you read the list of people participating you feel the sensation
</I>&gt;<i> that this is really a sort of closed club. Those are the IN VIP who
</I>&gt;<i> are speaking between them. I have a natural rejection for this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> meetings. Maybe it is just envy, but I suspect there is more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Among them the fact that real novely rarely is seen there. I think we
</I>&gt;<i> have much more possibilities to make a good gov2.0 us, then them. With
</I>&gt;<i> all due respect, just looking at the average age.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other side I remember the open conference Ed participated a few
</I>&gt;<i> months ago. All organised through the web. Everybody could
</I>&gt;<i> participate. All the talks are available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On Vilfredo in a couple of questions there were some suggestions that
</I>&gt;<i> we might organise a conference ourselves. A sort of open conference
</I>&gt;<i> like the one Ed was participating in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to hear the list comments on all this. Both on the
</I>&gt;<i> conferences being organised by O'Reilly, and the possibility that we
</I>&gt;<i> might organise a conference ourselves.
