<PRE>Suggestion to add Limiting principles

According to my suggestion in my User Talk on 17th August 2009 it seems to me important that we include among Basic principles (of this website) also our obligation that any here developed governing procedures and software will enable respecting of higher principles and rules, which will not allow acting of individuals or communities against Fundamental principles of human life on the Earth and against in this frame accepted decisions and consensus of other individuals and communities. Under communities also different organizations, companies and national states are thought.

According to the name of Fundamental principles of human life on the Earth, which explicitly defines the aim of these principles, it would be also wise that we in the title itself clearly define the aim of the basic principles of this website- for example:

Basic principles of developing community governing software

The suggested text in the continuation of listed Basic principles... would therefore be:

Limiting principles

The following principles will have to be respected at functioning of each community. Therefore the governance structures and supporting software will have to enable and assure limiting of consensus, agreements, decisions and actions according to:

* Fundamental principles of human life on the Earth - No community should act as the majority of all people on the Earth don't wish to. Like: no wars, no destroying nature, right to healthy food, ...

* Fundamental rules - Derived from these principles and adapted to be used in software. They consequently assure respecting of all subordinate programmed rules and laws.

* Human rights - These must be unified from different world human right documents, like EU, UN, ASEAN...

* Rights of the entire life on the Earth - The demands of the natural life and environment must be set before every human intention to destroy it.



I am not saying that we must develop and talk about all these fundamental principles and rights here. But it would be desirable to find some conclusions that the software designers and developers will get the clear guidelines, how to plan the philosophy of the governance software.
