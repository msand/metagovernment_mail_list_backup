This is a PPT version, though the original was in Keynote (for Mac).  
If you can run that, or if anyone wants it, I'll send that as well.  
That version is a little fancier.

As for what topics mustn't be absent, I would say: the objections to  
direct democracy. That was the key element I found in developing this  
slide set... that the objections to direct democracy are self- 
contradictory: ie, mob rule/demagoguery and issue-overload/tyranny-of- 
the-majority. Combining those produces the solution: open up  
everything to everyone and don't expect any issue to have much  
participation on most issues.

That and the fact that the genuine objections to direct democracy are  
in fact technical: that never before could we get all interested  
parties together for every decision, and that we lacked a  
sophisticated way to tally votes other than a count of for/against. In  
other words, we now have the internet to solve the first problem, and  
the member projects are building the software to solve the other.

P.S. Is your presentation in English or Spanish? The schedule  
indicates Spanish, while I had thought you had said it would be in  
English. One advantage of doing it in Spanish is that all other  
presentations in your timeslot are in English; so presumably you might  
attract most of the Spanish-speaking attendees...
