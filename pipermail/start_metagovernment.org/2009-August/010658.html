<PRE>If and, hopefully, when time permits, I will fill out parts of the
questionnaire on behalf of AIIM's StratML Committee.  However, with respect
to Michael's question, it seems to me that &quot;open&quot; collaboration implies that
individuals should be able to maintain their own data in open formats (like
StratML) anywhere on the Web that *they* choose.  Since I am already
overloaded with sites that require me to duplicate my digital persona in
order to participate in their in-groups, I have not yet decided whether I
can afford to waste still more of my time to register to participate in
openkollab.  To some degree my decision will be based upon whether the folks
involved in that effort share my interest in *open data*.  So far the
impression I have received is that they do not, or that at least it is not
as big a priority for them as it is to me.

Suresh, do you and your openkollab colleagues have any plans to document and
share your mission, vision, values, goals, objectives, and stakeholders on
the public Web in an open format like StratML?  If so, is the group inclined
to document a value supporting open data?  As you may recall, I have posted
your &quot;second round&quot; draft in StratML format at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/OK.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/OK.xml</A>
However, I do not intend to maintain the StratML collection indefinitely.
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#StratPlans">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#StratPlans</A>  After AIIM and ANSI have
approved the standard, hopefully, organizations like yours will begin to
realize the importance of open data and begin maintaining their own plans in
StratML format.

BTW, I do not share the value that you and your colleagues place on
real-time communications.  Having spent my 34-year career being subjected to
such communications, I sincerely believe there are better ways to convey
information and to accomplish shared objectives in most instances.

Once I understand how you'll authenticate and maintain all that data,
I'll spread the word around.  Maybe others have similar questions?
I'll wait to hear the answers.

Good luck,
