<PRE>Hi Mark,
I am very alarmed that you were unable to use Vilfredo.

I went into the DB but could not find your email address, or any other
log-in information that suggested me that you were there.
Have you registered at all?

The only way to use the discussion is to register. Only in this way is
it possible know who suggested what and who endorsed what.

If you did register, could you please explain me the problems you found?
Please let us clarify this, so that I make sure that the site works
better also for other people.

Right now the site is taking votes on entries that were suggested
before. Once everybody has voted and one week has passed (fabe could
move it sooner if he so wishes), the question would move on, and then
you could write your own suggestions.

Regards,
Pietro

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are some very interesting new ideas being proposed.

</I>&gt;<i> *wiki* as an equal to the *mailing list*&quot;. &#160; See also [[Edit policy]]
</I>&gt;<i> for a related discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The wiki concept supports the idea of multiple entry points into the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki space. &#160;The main page can be an &quot;official&quot; entry point for
</I>&gt;<i> relatively static content, but there ought to be a &quot;News Reel&quot; page
</I>&gt;<i> that lists &quot;Most active pages&quot; or &quot;Hot topics&quot; -- Pages on the site
</I>&gt;<i> which are showing activity, debate, discussion to keep part of the
</I>&gt;<i> site in user-time for those who frequently check-in to be part of the
</I>&gt;<i> community. &#160;This could (and SHOULD) be an automatically generated page
</I>&gt;<i> so as not to create much additional work to create, and even less to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a much more elaborate (and ultimately, I think, more
</I>&gt;<i> productive) solution to this problem but it would involve some pretty
</I>&gt;<i> hefty development of the mediawiki software to allow voting (thumbs
</I>&gt;<i> up/down style) of each revision, or something of that sort. &#160;Some
</I>&gt;<i> loose comments about this are at [[User:StalkingTime]].
