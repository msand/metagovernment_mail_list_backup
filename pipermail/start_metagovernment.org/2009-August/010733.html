A lot of the people in this project, including lead people in member  
projects, are not specifically academic. So as a compromise  
(synthesis?), how about if we have an &quot;academic track&quot; and a, um, non- 
academic track?

I would like to see a simple exposition of every project we can get  
involved. But I also am thrilled by the idea of having genuine  
academic papers presented. At least you and Owen are PhDs. :)

Did you see my multi-segment-presentation idea?

&gt;<i> And we should also invite some big names to participate and review  
</I>&gt;<i> the papers.
</I>
Suggestions? I would be willing to ask Craig Newmark and Richard  
Stallman. Who else?
