<PRE>With respect to prospects for automation, if strategic plans are drafted and
shared on the Web in an open format like StratML, it will become far easier
for software programs to identify those who have common interests based upon
shared missions, values, goals, objectives, and stakeholders.

However, as Michael suggests, whether those with common interests do in fact
become performance partners will depend upon the degrees to which they
decide and actually do begin to devote time and resources to the pursuit of
their common interests.

With respect to the issue of collaboration, on what other basis than common
objectives should it take place?  And if collaboration is to focus on common
objectives and it is to occur &quot;openly,&quot; isn't the first step to document our
(individual) objectives in an open format on the Web?  By definition, isn't
a focus on a &quot;platform&quot; other than the Web somewhat &quot;proprietary&quot; (closed)
in nature?

Thanks for initiating this, Suresh.  It's definitely wanted.

&gt;<i> As you know, the OpenKollab project is aiming, among other things,
</I>&gt;<i> to identify specific collaboration opportunities by matching
</I>&gt;<i> projects together on the basis of the information that we are
</I>&gt;<i> collecting. In Phae I of our plan is to post this information in an
</I>&gt;<i> open space: ... <A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/ProjectInfo.">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/ProjectInfo.</A> In
</I>&gt;<i> doing so and in actively marketing the the fact that we are doing
</I>&gt;<i> this, we hope to collect data on roughly 100 projects/smaller
</I>&gt;<i> organizations.
</I>
BTW, here's another project list being compiled for the domain of
online participation and e-democracy:
<A HREF="http://lists.thataway.org/scripts/wa-THATAWAY.exe?A2=ind0908B&amp;L=NCDD-DISCUSS">http://lists.thataway.org/scripts/wa-THATAWAY.exe?A2=ind0908B&amp;L=NCDD-DISCUSS</A>
ION&amp;P=15644

&gt;<i> Phase II of the project will then involve manually reviewing the data and
</I>&gt;<i> mapping organizations together to the best of our ability. In this process
</I>&gt;<i> we hope to identify the information that is relevant to actually match
</I>&gt;<i> organizations to each other.
</I>
It would be really great if you could focus on e-democracy, because
we'd really like to see the phase II information, as soon as
possible. :)

&gt;<i> In Phase III of the project, we will modify the questionnaire as well as
</I>try
&gt;<i> to automate, in the platform, the matching of projects to each other. We
</I>&gt;<i> will also then try to roll the idea out more widely and get a larger
</I>number
&gt;<i> of projects on the platform.
</I>
I imagine it would be difficult to automate, except by something like
a mechanical Turk.  The mappings will require intelligence and domain
knowledge.  Not only the mappings, but also the integrity of the data
will require human oversight.  If it's just a dumb machine, it will be
incessantly spammed.  (No doubt there's enough interest too, to power
a Turk - so no problem.)

It seems the most immediate requirement is for project and
organization lists that have timely, authenticated data - and a means
of keeping them that way.  A standard toolset and process for doing
that would be a big step forward in itself.  We don't have that yet.
It's a necessary preliminary too, to any kind of mapping effort
(whether automated or manual).

(Maybe my comments are off base.  I don't have the full picture yet.
 I'm on your list, so I'll wait to learn more.)
 
Thanks again for initiating this,
