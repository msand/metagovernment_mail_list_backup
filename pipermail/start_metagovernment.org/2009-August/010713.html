<PRE>I love it too, aand I think it should be included in our wiki. In fact
I think we should hae a sort of standard presentation to start with
that everybody can use.

A few points:
you speak about direct democracy.
In a question recently on Vilfredo the agreement was found that the
term &quot;collaborative democracy&quot; was a really good way to express what
we are trying to do. Consider inserting it somwhere.
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=53">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=53</A>

Instead of a group of organizations, consider calling us an &quot;umbrella&quot;
organization. I think this is the key word when we are speaking about
organization of organizations.

Again there was a question on what can a non programmer do to help in
metagovernment. The answer was quite long. I will not repeat tha
answer, but it was very detailed. You might find other ideas there
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=59">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=59</A>   (It was really long and
full of possibilities)

Speaking about Vilfredo, I am happy that we are included, even though
the project is so young. The homepage you used is not really the key
page. This is something I need to do from a long time. If you could
instead use a screenshot from <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php</A>
it would be much easier for people to understand.

I would also probably add two slides from the metagov page:
one with the list of similar projects. This because one of the reason
why people met us was because of this list. It is quite comprehensive
(and yes we need to contact them more. The italian ones are on my todo
list!)
the second page I would add is the list of projects. And I would add
that as an introduction to the presentation of the projects.

What I sometimes do, if I have internet connection, is to go to those
places LIVE during the presentation. It has a differen feeling. Like
going to a river instead of seeing a picture of it. And people realise
this is really a place they can go to. Just keep a screenshot in case
the website is down just on that day. Also as you do this they will
SEE how they are connected: ok from the homepage he has clicked on the
list of projects on the side. Ok, so here are all the projects, and
this was the one I was interested... and so on.

As a last slide I would add a slide with only a big thank you, your
name and the metagovernment.org In the middle. This will help them in
focusing on what they need to remember.

If you can get them just to scribble down the term metagovernment.org
you have done a great work.

I am now wondering what possibilities would thre be to make a video or
at least an MP3 of the presentation. Before video where so common, I
remember someone making a n mp3 where he just would say, &quot;next slide&quot;,
when it was time. The result was that you could follow the talk having
the slides and the mp3. But really, if you have a friend that attends,
with a camera, consider asking him to record the talk. Just make sure
the camera can sustain the whole length of the talk.

Best of luck!
We are all supporting you!
