<PRE>Sounds good, Ed.

With respect to the potential benefits of a &quot;unified venue,&quot; it would be
good if each project could be described and indexed according to an XML
schema for the description of projects on the Web.  

In AIIM's StratML Committee, we do not at this time plan to specify elements
down to the level of &quot;project&quot; and &quot;program&quot; descriptions.  However, it
would be good if the missions, visions, values, goals, objectives, and
stakeholders of each of the Metagov-related projects could be documented in
StratML format, as a number of them already are at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other</A>

It would also be good if those &quot;plans&quot; could serve as the focal point for
ongoing collaborative effort by stakeholders who are sufficiently motivated
to act as performance partners in pursuit of each project.

I have been thinking along these lines, and it seems that the only  
solution is to reinvent the standard conference format somewhat.

The traditional conference has a speaker (panel, group, etc.) present  
a topic at a certain time and place, and then there is often a Q&amp;A  
after that.

I suggest that we have presenters prepare a relatively short video in  
advance. We than post all the videos to a website by a certain time.  
Anyone would then have a day or two to review the videos they want to  
watch and write in questions. Presenters would then appear live at two  
different times (about 12 hours apart... or maybe 36 hours apart) to  
reply to those questions and also to live follow-ups and new live  
questions. These additional sessions would also be archived for later  
viewing.

This raises some technological issues (especially getting speakers to  
be able to produce and encode videos) and also potentially financial  
issues, but those should be surmountable.

In addition to the above, we would also want a free-form chat  
venue(s). It would be great if we could do that in audio or video, but  
text might be more realistic.

&gt;<i> In my view, it would be good if such contributions could be more

</I>&gt;<i> a set

</I>&gt;<i> conference
</I>&gt;<i> organizers.  (Participants should be free to propose other goals/ 
</I>&gt;<i> objectives
</I>&gt;<i> if they wish.)
</I>
It might be most reasonable and sufficient for us simply to ask each  
member project (along with new member projects, hopefully) to present  
their project. I think it would be beneficial to all of us and to a  
lot of other people to have such expositions of each project in a  
unified venue.
