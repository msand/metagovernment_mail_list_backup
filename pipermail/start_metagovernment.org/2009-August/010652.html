Thanks for initiating this, Suresh.  It's definitely wanted.

&gt;<i> As you know, the OpenKollab project is aiming, among other things,
</I>&gt;<i> to identify specific collaboration opportunities by matching
</I>&gt;<i> projects together on the basis of the information that we are
</I>&gt;<i> collecting. In Phae I of our plan is to post this information in an
</I>&gt;<i> open space: ... <A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/ProjectInfo.">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/ProjectInfo.</A> In
</I>&gt;<i> doing so and in actively marketing the the fact that we are doing
</I>&gt;<i> this, we hope to collect data on roughly 100 projects/smaller
</I>&gt;<i> organizations.
</I>
BTW, here's another project list being compiled for the domain of
online participation and e-democracy:
<A HREF="http://lists.thataway.org/scripts/wa-THATAWAY.exe?A2=ind0908B&amp;L=NCDD-DISCUSSION&amp;P=15644">http://lists.thataway.org/scripts/wa-THATAWAY.exe?A2=ind0908B&amp;L=NCDD-DISCUSSION&amp;P=15644</A>

&gt;<i> Phase II of the project will then involve manually reviewing the data and
</I>&gt;<i> mapping organizations together to the best of our ability. In this process
</I>&gt;<i> we hope to identify the information that is relevant to actually match
</I>&gt;<i> organizations to each other.
</I>
It would be really great if you could focus on e-democracy, because
we'd really like to see the phase II information, as soon as
possible. :)

&gt;<i> In Phase III of the project, we will modify the questionnaire as well as try
</I>&gt;<i> to automate, in the platform, the matching of projects to each other. We
</I>&gt;<i> will also then try to roll the idea out more widely and get a larger number
</I>&gt;<i> of projects on the platform.
</I>
I imagine it would be difficult to automate, except by something like
a mechanical Turk.  The mappings will require intelligence and domain
knowledge.  Not only the mappings, but also the integrity of the data
will require human oversight.  If it's just a dumb machine, it will be
incessantly spammed.  (No doubt there's enough interest too, to power
a Turk - so no problem.)

It seems the most immediate requirement is for project and
organization lists that have timely, authenticated data - and a means
of keeping them that way.  A standard toolset and process for doing
that would be a big step forward in itself.  We don't have that yet.
It's a necessary preliminary too, to any kind of mapping effort
(whether automated or manual).

(Maybe my comments are off base.  I don't have the full picture yet.
 I'm on your list, so I'll wait to learn more.)
 
Thanks again for initiating this,
