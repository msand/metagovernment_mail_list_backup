This is similar to the technique Manuel and Pietro had come up with a  
while ago: that the software can evaluate a user's cloud of influence:  
ie, which users are rating that user and vice-versa. If it is found  
that, for example, a whole group of &quot;users&quot; are giving each other high  
rankings, but almost nobody outside that group is rating any of those  
users, then the software can collapse them all into one person.

Of course, in larger-scaled instances, this gets more complicated as  
one might have many different people using sock puppets with each  
other, but the basic idea should still convey.
