<PRE>Hi Mike,

I would be in favor of allowing any and all methods of user registration by
distributed groups, so long as there is a relatively easy way to index what
votes are from what group and the quality of that registration method. which
pretty obviously is one of three levels

1. email only verification
2. CC verification (paying membership dues)
3. photoID / sponsor (probably includes 2)


One observation observation made by a friend of mine is that the thing our
democracy sorely lacks is a level between our elected representatives and
individual voters. There is a breakdown in accountability between the person
who (supposedly) represents 100,000 and the single voter.  So hopefully
e-democracy is something that is amenable to and easily adopted by those
local groups, residents associations, tenants associations, churches, etc.
If you have registration at this group level it reinforces the local nodes
and networks and local leaders of those nodes.

the best administrative backbone is to have these groups running an
established open source groupware (shall we list them in the wiki). devs can
get those installs to talk to each other in the ways that we need.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem would then fall to the social groups, with each group

</I>&gt;<i> Do you have a particular method in mind?
