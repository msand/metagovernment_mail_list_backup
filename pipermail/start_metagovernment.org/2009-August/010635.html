Yes, that is correct. And I believe many countries have similar  
constructions.

Your point about the distinction between laws and constitutions is  
very timely, and I am rather surprised it has not come up before.  
There is a great richness to be found in a more fluid legal structure,  
but there is also a fundamental sense to having something more rigid  
at the core which can provide a framework for everything else to hang  
on.

Well, that was the original idea behind the word &quot;meta&quot; in  
metagovernment. It seemed that if you're going to make a new legal  
structure, you need something at &quot;the top&quot; to be a sort of arbitrator  
when things get too confusing on the &quot;lower&quot; levels. As long as the  
top structure itself is also open to everyone, it is not like it is  
some sort of oppressive authority... just a more generalized form of  
the same thing going on at lower levels.

This again seems like something that is going to need to be figured  
out slowly, as this process develops. I would think that very small  
communities (such as a condominium) are going to have a charter and  
then use one of our systems to work through issues not immediately  
addressed in the charter (such as which company to hire to fix the  
roof).

The charter itself won't be open to an online system, at least in the  
early stages, simply because there is no legal framework to support  
it. There are no laws recognizing this sort of structure, so it very  
well may be illegal for a condominium to not have an elected board of  
directors. At first. As they begin to experiment and get more  
recognition, then they will start to figure out how to apply these  
systems to charters in addition to policies.

But your point is still well taken that clearly we need to figure this  
out for ourselves sooner than that, so I do want to see this  
discussion continue. I like the idea of a separate wiki for each  
principle, as if each principle were (rightly so) a major institution  
in itself.
