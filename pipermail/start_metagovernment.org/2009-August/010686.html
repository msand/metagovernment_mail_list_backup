<PRE>Have you guys seen intense debate?
<A HREF="http://intensedebate.com/">http://intensedebate.com/</A>

It's a website-service-series of plugins.
The aim is to link together the comment system of all the various
blogs. It uses open id (of course).
People can comment on each other blog, and vote each other comment up
and down. It also have karma.

What I could not undertsand is how intense debate handles people that
have more than one blog (like, me).

Also it seem to me that, like in other cases, we have a case of one
size is imposed to all karma. In other words the guys at intense
debate impose what is the karma algorithm, and you can only go along
with it.

I wonder if we could suggest way to open this up, so that each blog
could have it's own way to calculate karma. Or would this be too
algorithm intensive.

Put it like this, I and Manuel have an exchange in blog A. We voted
each other comments up. This highers our karma inside blog B. But not
inside blog C, because blog C considers that if A votes someone up,
and that person votes back up the first, we could be looking at a
group of people helping each other. SO does not permit 2 person loops.

But the only way to get this is that Intense Debate releases all its
information on who commented what. And there are issues on this.

I would suggest to everybody to see the 2 minutes video of
presentation at their website. Funny, in the video the specifically
say: We don't do walled gardens here.
Except that the karma system is a walled garden.

Cheers,
Pietro

P.S. Manuele, I sorted my open id problem. I need to log in in my blog
as the administrator, not just with my normal user account. Then it
sends the openid ok.
