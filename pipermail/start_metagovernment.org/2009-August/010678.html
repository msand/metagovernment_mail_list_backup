<PRE>Hey Everyone! This is just a friendly reminder about Our Weekly IRC Chat:
The whole group meets every Wednesday at 3PM GMT/UTC (that is 8AM PDT, 11AM
EDT) on the IRC channel #openkollab. It&#8217;s been another insane week at
OpenKollab! A week marked by intense discussion and dialogue around a range
of different issues. We are in the early stages of discussion regarding what
the architecture of the OpenKollaboration Platform should be and, in keeping
with the very early stage nature of this project, the discussion surrounded
two very fundamental issues: syntax and ontology. Namely the related
questions are: SYNTAX AND ONTOLOGY Syntax: What should the syntactic
structure of information be such that users can easily interface with the
platform? This leads to another related question: Ontology: Should the
structure of information in the system be organized according to a
completely distributed peer to peer model with the user defining the
meta-data (tagging model) or should there be some top-down influence
(ontology model). Clearly syntax and ontological considerations can&#8217;t be
separated, but the discussions have been in parallel. Initially, a proposal
was advanced suggesting that we look at the problem in terms of relational
operators that would help to link an organizations needs to offers of
resources available etc. Details of this can be found at:
<A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Syntactic_Considerations_for_Natural_Language_Input_of_Project_Needs_Resources_and_Goals_as_advanced_by_Suresh_Fernando_Aug_13_2009For">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Syntactic_Considerations_for_Natural_Language_Input_of_Project_Needs_Resources_and_Goals_as_advanced_by_Suresh_Fernando_Aug_13_2009For</A>
the clearest articulation of the case for a distributed P2P
information
system, read Clay Shirky&#8217;s piece: Ontology is overrated (
<A HREF="http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html">http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html</A> For an argument in
favour of the ontology model in the context of a collaborative platform see:
<A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/OK_Ontological_Considerations">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/OK_Ontological_Considerations</A> The latest
architectural proposal, Tent as advanced by Tav, is distributed architecture
model that can provide the underpinnings for a system that will make
possible what is required by those that are advancing the argument in favour
of the importance of ontology in this context. Initial thoughts on the tent
proposal can be found at:
<A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Tent_as_advanced_by_Tav_on_Aug_14_2009">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Tent_as_advanced_by_Tav_on_Aug_14_2009</A> WHAT
SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY LEVEL OF DESCRIPTION? &#8211; Projects, individuals or&#8230;
Another area around which there was some discussion was the question as to
what the primary level of description should be. Gerry suggested that it
should not be the project level (
<A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Gerry_raises_the_question,">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Gerry_raises_the_question,</A> Suresh argues in
favour of projects (

SUPER-ORDINATE AND SUB-ORDINATE GOALS Since the aim of the OK Collaboration
Platform is to drive collaboration, one issue that requires detailed
consideration is how to think about the goals of organizations. What do we
need to know and how can we link them. An initial proposal relating to this
can be found at:
<A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/OPENKOLLAB_SUPER_AND_SUBORDINATE_GOALSVirtual">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/OPENKOLLAB_SUPER_AND_SUBORDINATE_GOALSVirtual</A>
Currencies Another thread that emerged was the issue of virtual
currencies &#8211; mechanisms that allow us to compensate those that are
contributing to the collaborative process. Gerry initially raised the issue:
<A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Gerry_raises_the_issue">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Gerry_raises_the_issue</A> Gerry and Suresh dig
a little deeper:

RELATED APPLICATIONS Alex also introduced a couple of really
interesting wordpress plug-ins that can link you to interesting blog posts,
paragraphs and even sentences based upon keywords within your own posts.
Details can be found at:
<A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Collaboration_Tools_Discussion">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Collaboration_Tools_Discussion</A> SUB PROJECTS
One sub-project that we could really use your help with is Project Mapping.
We are aiming to manually gather data on a number of companies to begin a
&#8216;bottom-up&#8217; process of driving collaboration. This will complement the more
top down approach that will, in time, be driven by our platform. See Gerry&#8217;s
comments (<A HREF="http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Process_Dialogue">http://wiki.openkollab.com/wagn/Process_Dialogue</A>) It also supports
our efforts by providing us with specific information on exactly what sorts
of information about companies is actually required in order to make
collaboration happen. This is information that will be necessary to make the
OK Collaboration Platform actually work! Information on this sub-project can
be found at: Project Mapping:
