<PRE>Hi Kris, maybe I can answer you, since we have discussed the topic
plenty of time.

The idea is that we want to produce a software with which a community
can self govern, without any person being in charge. Not even the
programmers! The software would be essentially the same for different
communities, with various ocal adaptations, and parameters depending
from community to community. And that would set, for example, how much
weight to give to experience, and how much weight to give to external
people from the community that still wish to participate. Etc.

Once the software is out, it would requie rextensive testing. And
testing at a level in which you can in any moment unplug it, and say:
well the software said a, but we would like the software in this
situation to say b, so what is wrong with the software. You can do
this only if the community is small enough. So we are aiming to start
with small communities (like ourselves, but also the local chess -or
Go- club; a class in a school;...) and then open it up to bigger and
bigger groups. Once the software can do an acceptable business in
community of size n it shouldn't be that difficult to propose it for
communities of size slightly bigger than n. So once we have the whole
thing working for the class, we could suggest it for a sub-section of
the whole school. Or even the whole school. Once we have for a single
chess club in one city, it can be reused for other chess clubs, until
you can suggest to do it at higher level, and so on.

Every time the software would go from one level to the other, it would
require testing to see if it is ok also at this new level. In
particular we will need to test:
a) speed of it (the bigger it is the slower, but how much slower?)
b) speed of the algorithm in converging into a solution (say we are
using Vilfredo, we could kind of find an agreement in 3-10 generatin
with up to 5 people; how many generations would be needed for 50
people? And for 500? And for 5000? 50.000? 500.000? and so on. The
more diverse the group is, the more the ideas are diverse, and the
more people feel inclined to be helpful to the community because they
feel less part of the community. WHich makes finding an agreement
harder.
c) many other things ... :)

What we are experiencing right now, is that while the software and the
algorithm are not yet ready there is an interest in all this from the
top down. And this is both a good thing, and a bed thing. It is good
because people are starting to play with it. It is bad because people
will use half cooked solutions. They will not work, and then probably
they will reject the whole idea.

A bit like the burst of the .com bubble in 98. We still have the
internet after. It's just that everybody was so excited by it, that
the natural growth simply could not sustain the expectation.

And my message to the world is:
relax, we are coming :)
