<PRE>Hi Thomas (and everyone at Metagovernment),

Thanks for getting in touch. It's incredibly important that we all know what
we're doing and it's great to see all the progress you guys have made so
far.

I'm happy that so many important e-democracy initiatives are working
together.

Our aims at GlobalDemo.org are to build a neutral platform for the 'global
democracy movement'. Basically, to do what you're doing with e-democracy
initiatives - to try and bring everyone together in one place.

However, we don't want GlobalDemo to be a decision making platform, but
rather somewhere where people can meet local activists and get active in the
real world (including through the various e-democracy projects).

We are all about collaboration and I think we should think about how best we
can do it.

Is the Metagovernment group particularly concerned with internet tools? How
would non-internet projects fit into it?

Could GlobalDemo.org be incorporated as a project of Metagovernment
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A> ?

Anyway, would be great to hear all your ideas.

We're still developing/testing the site but some of it is almost there
(though it's still a bit buggy). Here are a few pages:

<A HREF="http://globaldemo.org/en/intro">http://globaldemo.org/en/intro</A>
<A HREF="http://globaldemo.org/en/world">http://globaldemo.org/en/world</A>
<A HREF="http://globaldemo.org/en/germany">http://globaldemo.org/en/germany</A>
<A HREF="http://globaldemo.org/de/organisations">http://globaldemo.org/de/organisations</A>
<A HREF="http://globaldemo.org/de/library">http://globaldemo.org/de/library</A>

The idea is that everything is user generated apart from obviously a few
intro/core pages which are handled by the webteam.

So yes, lets collaborate in any way we can!

Cheers,

James
ps here is the info about us:

I) GlobalDemo.org is a community website for those who believe in democracy
at a global level. Members can share and discuss articles, books, films and
proposals for global democracy, as well as forming regional and project
groups to focus their activism.

II) GlobalDemo.org is also a resource for those new to the idea of global
democracy who want to find out more in a clear, comprehensible way. Visitors
can then find opportunities to get involved, either through a group on the
website, or through a partner organisation linked through the website.

III GlobalDemo.org emerged from a desire for a neutral platform for everyone
in the gobal democracy movement, as well as an easy way for those new to the
concept to find out more. As a result, it does not support or endorse any
particular form of global democracy, but rather encourages members to focus
on the shared goal of establishing democracy on a global level while
debating the merits of the various proposals.

 IV) GlobalDemo.org is unaffiliated to any political party, national or
otherwise. It is managed on a day-to-day basis by the globaldemo website
group, a team of volunteers who work on developing and maintaining the
website. We are always looking for volunteers to join our team. The legal
umbrella for the website is provided by the Campaign for Global Democracy
(CGD), a fully democratic membership association based in the Netherlands.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I write is because I am part of a group of several e-dem-
</I>&gt;<i> projects which until recently were unaware of your work but felt the
</I>&gt;<i> same need for new ways to cooperate and communicate within the e-dem-
</I>&gt;<i> movement as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now we are at the point, where we invite like-minded projects to
</I>&gt;<i> join us in the founding of a Meta-Organization similar to yours.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, we are a bit more focused on pure technical e-
</I>&gt;<i> democracy issues, whereas you seem more focused on global democracy
</I>&gt;<i> and its contents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to invite you to explore areas of possible cooperation
</I>&gt;<i> together with us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have together drafted an invitation-letter for the other projects
</I>&gt;<i> and I would like to cite a few sentences, for a better impression of
</I>&gt;<i> our goal:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We are members of the e-democracy projects DemocracyLab, Metascore,
</I>&gt;<i> NationBuilder, Vilfredo, Telematics Freedom Foundation and Votorola,
</I>&gt;<i> along with other individuals interested in open, internet-based
</I>&gt;<i> democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Recently we came to an agreement that it would be desirable to
</I>&gt;<i> increase the level of communication and collaboration among similar
</I>&gt;<i> projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In doing this, we hope:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. To benefit from synergy among the projects.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. To foster open discussion and idea-sharing.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. To avoid competition for users (voters) among us. Because this
</I>&gt;<i> would unnecessarily slow down the e-democracy-movement as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore we think it is desirable to begin to define an &quot;open
</I>&gt;<i> governance standard&quot;, in order to exchange user data all of our
</I>&gt;<i> projects.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. To agree on common technical standards, so our tools and systems
</I>&gt;<i> can intercommunicate and inter-operate. We see the existence of
</I>&gt;<i> multiple projects as the existence of different approaches to find the
</I>&gt;<i> yet unknown solution to the 'creation of an open source governance
</I>&gt;<i> system' for a healthier society. A mix of competition and cooperation
</I>&gt;<i> seems the best strategy for answering this problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment has long been the platform for our communication
</I>&gt;<i> already, and was therefore on its way to becoming the coordinating
</I>&gt;<i> group for our various projects anyway. Its software development arm,
</I>&gt;<i> Metascore, is now detached as an autonomous project. Metagovernment is
</I>&gt;<i> therefore able to offer its name and its wiki-pages in support of the
</I>&gt;<i> new meta-organization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have already started to draft the new homepage under
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org.">http://metagovernment.org.</A>&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We communicate via a list server. If you are interested please feel
</I>&gt;<i> invited to join our list server at <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and let us know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I&#180;ll be around here in the GlobalDemo-webgroup too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas
