<PRE>Hi,

Thought I'd share an idea I put up on the wiki awhile ago.  It's
mostly invisible if people aren't interested, but for those who might
be:

Rather than postpone an article because the user doesn't feel like
it's polished enough, wiki experiments sortof reveal that it's better
to start anyway and just mark the article as a STUB.  This serves [at
least] two purposes.  It allows the wiki to act as a sort of memory
store so that the user doesn't lose track of the ideas, and 2) allows
others to build upon the idea if they get the gist of it before others
return to it.  For example, the [[invitation]] and [[Main
Page/2009draft]] articles would have been perfect uses for this tag.
By putting [[STUB]] in the article others are implicitly invited to
contribute to (and complete) that article and by going to the STUB
page, one can click &quot;What links here&quot; in the side bar and see all the
articles on the site that are asking for assistance.  Pretty powerful
feature for very little overhead/maintenance.

Anyway I hope it's useful.  Use freely :)

marcos
