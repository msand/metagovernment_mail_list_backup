<PRE>Pietro, since I live in the area and could attend the Gov 2.0 conference
without travel expense, I requested an &quot;invitation&quot; without knowing about
the substantial registration cost.  I don't begrudge anyone trying to make a
living.  Indeed, one way or another, we all must do so, and better that it
be through direct, open, publicly &quot;advertised&quot; sources than through
indirect, unclear, if not necessarily &quot;secretive&quot; means (e.g., tax
subsidies).  However, I did feel a sense of being baited-and-switched, which
leaves me a little more skeptical of the sponsors than I was before.  I also
tend to share your view of this being sort of a &quot;closed club&quot;.  I have
nothing against such clubs.  Indeed, I believe we have the right to form any
associations we wish.  However, as a retired .gov employee, I do believe
those who are on the public payroll (paid with tax revenues extracted by
coercion) have an obligation to share with the public any information
exchanged at such events.  If they don't feel comfortable doing so, they
should not be participating in such events, and if we continue to allow them
to get away with it, we will have no one to blame but ourselves.

Subject: [Start] gov 2.0 conferences

Have you all seen:
<A HREF="https://en.oreilly.com/gov2009/public/register">https://en.oreilly.com/gov2009/public/register</A>

this is a gov2.0 conference in the US.
I think it was organised (but not sponsored) by O'Reilly. The cost to
participate is extreemely high.

I mean, seriously, even through the Uni this cost high even compared
to other conferences.

If you read the list of people participating you feel the sensation
that this is really a sort of closed club. Those are the IN VIP who
are speaking between them. I have a natural rejection for this kind of
meetings. Maybe it is just envy, but I suspect there is more.

Among them the fact that real novely rarely is seen there. I think we
have much more possibilities to make a good gov2.0 us, then them. With
all due respect, just looking at the average age.
On the other side I remember the open conference Ed participated a few
months ago. All organised through the web. Everybody could
participate. All the talks are available.

On Vilfredo in a couple of questions there were some suggestions that
we might organise a conference ourselves. A sort of open conference
like the one Ed was participating in.

I would like to hear the list comments on all this. Both on the
conferences being organised by O'Reilly, and the possibility that we
might organise a conference ourselves.
