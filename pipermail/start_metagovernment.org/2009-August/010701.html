<PRE>Have you all seen:
<A HREF="https://en.oreilly.com/gov2009/public/register">https://en.oreilly.com/gov2009/public/register</A>

this is a gov2.0 conference in the US.
I think it was organised (but not sponsored) by O'Reilly. The cost to
participate is extreemely high.

I mean, seriously, even through the Uni this cost high even compared
to other conferences.

If you read the list of people participating you feel the sensation
that this is really a sort of closed club. Those are the IN VIP who
are speaking between them. I have a natural rejection for this kind of
meetings. Maybe it is just envy, but I suspect there is more.

Among them the fact that real novely rarely is seen there. I think we
have much more possibilities to make a good gov2.0 us, then them. With
all due respect, just looking at the average age.
On the other side I remember the open conference Ed participated a few
months ago. All organised through the web. Everybody could
participate. All the talks are available.

On Vilfredo in a couple of questions there were some suggestions that
we might organise a conference ourselves. A sort of open conference
like the one Ed was participating in.

I would like to hear the list comments on all this. Both on the
conferences being organised by O'Reilly, and the possibility that we
might organise a conference ourselves.
