<PRE>These are some great initiatives, Tal.

In particular, Ecclesia seems very much along the lines of some of the  
other software projects in this group. Is it open source? Also, when  
you say it is &quot;an extended facebook,&quot; do you mean that it will be an  
extension to FaceBook, or that it is will act something like FaceBook?

Also, would you like to formally join the group of participating  
projects? There is no real commitment other than adding your name to  
the relevant pages:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/">http://metagovernment.org/</A>
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A>
and participating in this list as you can.

&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My name is Tal, and I am from the Israeli direct democracy movement.  
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to introduce to you our projects and area of intrest. I  
</I>&gt;<i> can elaborate more on projects and topics that you will find  
</I>&gt;<i> interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We started our group in January 2008. we have done research on the  
</I>&gt;<i> problems of represntetives democracy and tryed to get femiliar with  
</I>&gt;<i> diffrent stiles of direct democracy (In Athen, Switzerland the USA,  
</I>&gt;<i> and anarchists groups) , and we sarched for ways to bring direct  
</I>&gt;<i> democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We found out the ways and reasons for the control of unselcted  
</I>&gt;<i> oligarchies on the represntatives democracy. and then we strated to  
</I>&gt;<i> think how can we take from them the power, in install it in the  
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> we found out that the main reason for oligarchic control is because  
</I>&gt;<i> small groups with allot of resources can coordinate themselves and  
</I>&gt;<i> take collective action much easily then large groups without extra  
</I>&gt;<i> resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We therefore set several initiative that will enable the people to  
</I>&gt;<i> act together much better.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We have one project that is called Ecllesia (in development),  
</I>&gt;<i> which is built by the Django community in Israel. It should be an  
</I>&gt;<i> extended facebook, which will let huge groups to debate, and find  
</I>&gt;<i> out way to cooperate as a hall. it is based on a method of arguing,  
</I>&gt;<i> that will enable large audiences to get in easy way to an agreement.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Another project is Called OpenKnesst, which will be much like the  
</I>&gt;<i> TheyWorkForYou project. It's aim is to make the parliamentary work  
</I>&gt;<i> much more transparent. and will let the citizens what their MPs are  
</I>&gt;<i> really doing :-) This we hope will make the MPs more obligate to the  
</I>&gt;<i> public that selected them.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. WebActivism (webactivism.info) - it is a group of people that  
</I>&gt;<i> created web2.0 based campaigns. it will help new people run there  
</I>&gt;<i> own campaigns. we hope though to make the the public more powerful  
</I>&gt;<i> in meaningful and influential campaigns.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. a group for advisors for democracy. The aim of the group is to  
</I>&gt;<i> help communities get organize, and work democratically. it advise  
</I>&gt;<i> them how to influence the local government, and how to create a  
</I>&gt;<i> democratic culture. we believe that this will create the cultural  
</I>&gt;<i> base for real grass-root democracy. We have done allot of research  
</I>&gt;<i> in this area, and we are now experimenting in a real communities. so  
</I>&gt;<i> far it is going quite nicely and have a good influence on the local  
</I>&gt;<i> government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have more projects in our mind, which we think can strengthen the  
</I>&gt;<i> citizens, but some had failed and some we didn't get to them yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have any questions, or disagreement, please let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Tal, The Israeli direct democracy movement (kol1.org/wiki - in Hebrew)
