<PRE>Hello all,

My name is Tal, and I am from the Israeli direct democracy movement. I would
like to introduce to you our projects and area of intrest. I can elaborate
more on projects and topics that you will find interesting.

We started our group in January 2008. we have done research on the problems
of represntetives democracy and tryed to get femiliar with diffrent stiles
of direct democracy (In Athen, Switzerland the USA, and anarchists groups) ,
and we sarched for ways to bring direct democracy.

We found out the ways and reasons for the control of unselcted oligarchies
on the represntatives democracy. and then we strated to think how can we
take from them the power, in install it in the people.

we found out that the main reason for oligarchic control is because small
groups with allot of resources can coordinate themselves and take collective
action much easily then large groups without extra resources.

We therefore set several initiative that will enable the people to act
together much better.
1. We have one project that is called *Ecllesia &lt;<A HREF="http://bit.ly/ecclesia">http://bit.ly/ecclesia</A>&gt; (in
development)*, which is built by the Django community in Israel. It should
be an extended facebook, which will let huge groups to debate, and find out
way to cooperate as a hall. it is based on a method of arguing, that will
enable large audiences to get in easy way to an agreement.
2. Another project is Called OpenKnesst, which will be much like the
TheyWorkForYou project. It's aim is to make the parliamentary work much more
transparent. and will let the citizens what their MPs are really doing :-)
This we hope will make the MPs more obligate to the public that selected
them.
3. WebActivism (webactivism.info) - it is a group of people that created
web2.0 based campaigns. it will help new people run there own campaigns. we
hope though to make the the public more powerful in meaningful and
influential campaigns.
4. a group for advisors for democracy. The aim of the group is to help
communities get organize, and work democratically. it advise them how to
influence the local government, and how to create a democratic culture. we
believe that this will create the cultural base for real grass-root
democracy. We have done allot of research in this area, and we are now
experimenting in a real communities. so far it is going quite nicely and
have a good influence on the local government.

We have more projects in our mind, which we think can strengthen the
citizens, but some had failed and some we didn't get to them yet.

If you have any questions, or disagreement, please let me know.

Cheers,
Tal, The Israeli direct democracy movement (kol1.org/wiki - in Hebrew)
