<PRE>I think this is really interesting. We have found an agreement on
this, but the agreement is on a smaller part of the question. We can't
really claim that the result represents the fullness of the question.
Now we should open a new question, which uses this result as part of
the foundations and tries to go on.

Here is a precedent.

This question:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=28">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=28</A>
Suppose there were no copyright laws. How would the world be different?


gave the answer:
True art would still mostly happen because true art comes from a human
necessity to express some deep parts of its soul.

&gt;<i>From this the new question arise:
</I>Title:
Which kind of business without copyright?
body:
True art will not die without copyright laws (see this question).
But what will happen the the publishing, music and movie industry?

<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=52">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=52</A>

Which took some more time to reach an agreement.

Maybe we should follow a similar model.


Cheers,
Pietro
