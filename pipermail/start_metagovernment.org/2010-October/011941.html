<PRE>&gt;<i> My impression is that this entire process needs to follow more of a
</I>&gt;<i> scientific ecosystem approach of combined theory and practice (or more
</I>&gt;<i> accurately: hypothesis and experiment). Democracy theory seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> ill-equipped to survive first contact with real-world politics. Thinking
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise is implying that one can truly understand and predict human
</I>&gt;<i> nature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although it is painful and sometimes discouraging, the most practical
</I>&gt;<i> approach seems to be to come up with a hypothesis, build a system to test
</I>&gt;<i> it, and then watch it fail (very likely), succeed (possible, I guess), or
</I>&gt;<i> morph (quite possible). Then assess what happened and try again.
</I>
My feeling is that this would accelerate development dramatically, and
personally I would love to try it in a eXtreme Programming,
pair-programming methodology, where vision and implementation can take
turns with two people instead of all the solo ideas out there.   Those
two domains are miles away from each other and it's frustratingly hard
(if not impossible) to travel back and forth between two such
disparate nodes without losing all the energy.  But two people would
make a dynamic self-energizing system.   I would invite anyone to pull
the python code and irc our way into an implementation.  The STATUS
page on the wiki gives the next steps and the theory necessary for the
beta release is simple but should (in theory :) provide considerable
power.

That last 15% that Richard mentions, for me, is due to just how
abstract the theory is, and to bring such a huge abstraction into
implementation is challenging.  But, nonetheless, I argue that it is
provably optimal, and it's just a matter of deciding on an arbitrary
grouping in order to seed the process (that's been the sticky part).

Also I wanted to mention on the issue of voting theory, most voting
systems carry a huge assumption which just doesn't apply (or doesn't
need/want to apply) to an internet dynamic.  What Pietro calls state
of the art, I suggest is actually a bit outdated.  Little of what is
&quot;voting theory&quot; was ever in a context of the internet where a
self-organizing, real-time dynamic can come into play.  The idea of
voting booths should be the clue.
