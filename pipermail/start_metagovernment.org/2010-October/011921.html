&gt;<i> Personal Democracy Forum report, EU edition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I went to the Personal Democracy Forum, here are my impression for this group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The two days were incredible, full of networking and ideas. In general
</I>&gt;<i> I would say that we are at least 10 years ahead of everybody there.
</I>&gt;<i> Most people there concentrate on trasparency, and open data. Some on
</I>&gt;<i> the digital divide. There is a lot of work and a lot of noise on
</I>&gt;<i> results we would consider trivial or at maximum irrelevant. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, politicians using facebook and twitter to reach more people.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that can be done, but it is just using facebook and twitter as a
</I>&gt;<i> 1 to many system. Can't we do anything better?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every now and then someone would get it. There were presentations were
</I>&gt;<i> a politician would express her frustration: I receive 100 emails a
</I>&gt;<i> day, how can I integrate them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some people did not realise that the problem, the key problem, is a
</I>&gt;<i> problem of integration. So we had the CEO of GetUp who would tell us
</I>&gt;<i> how he had millions of people signing his actions, and each sending
</I>&gt;<i> personal emails to their representatives. But there is a catch: the
</I>&gt;<i> emails are personal but the meaning of message is always about the
</I>&gt;<i> same. Then the representatives calling it Spam. I would give reasons
</I>&gt;<i> to the representatives, but of course the man in the street didn't.
</I>&gt;<i> Again the problem is a problem of integration of the multiple voices
</I>&gt;<i> and framing of this problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would say that only a very very tiny minority had framed the problem
</I>&gt;<i> in the right context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A politician from CDU (christian democrats in germany) described how
</I>&gt;<i> you have thousands of email protesting, but when the same people are
</I>&gt;<i> invited to participate in a constructive production of an alternative
</I>&gt;<i> the number drops to hundreds, and then the original ideas end up being
</I>&gt;<i> about 20-30. Those are good news, because 20-30 original ideas are
</I>&gt;<i> numbers that our systems can absolutely cope with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another person who really framed the work VERY well was Paul Johnston
</I>&gt;<i> that in the talk Opening Up Policy-Making to Public Participation,
</I>&gt;<i> gave us some really good insights about how we need to start maturing
</I>&gt;<i> up. How elected representatives just cannot cope with thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> unrelated emails, of how few of those emails actually have real
</I>&gt;<i> content. I hope I can find the video online. Those are people who are
</I>&gt;<i> pushing the group toward the direction we are interested in, having
</I>&gt;<i> citizen work inside the government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another interesting talk was about europetitions. Did you knew that
</I>&gt;<i> anyone can petition the EU parliament. Even more, it looks like it
</I>&gt;<i> does not even have to be a european to do it (wow).
</I>&gt;<i> There are two kind of petitions, petitions where you are suggesting a
</I>&gt;<i> law and I think that for this you need to be 1 million signatures from
</I>&gt;<i> the EU. But then there is also another form of petition. For example
</I>&gt;<i> if a local law does not follow EU standard you (anyone, any single
</I>&gt;<i> person) can send a petition. We were presented a website where people
</I>&gt;<i> can write a petition, and send it to the EU parliament. Also when the
</I>&gt;<i> parliament replies the reply is sent to all the participants. So I
</I>&gt;<i> dialogue between the EU parliament and the citizen is potentially
</I>&gt;<i> started. Although petitions have limited power I think this is really
</I>&gt;<i> cool. And I spoke with Reindr Rustma who was presenting this website.
</I>&gt;<i> They have an API, so it is possible to interface it from the outside,
</I>&gt;<i> so now I am considering organising a vilfredo plug in, so people can
</I>&gt;<i> write a petition together, and then send it with a click.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During the forum I also started a new question in Vilfredo and I
</I>&gt;<i> advertised at pdf on twitter, using the pdfeu tag. We are running the
</I>&gt;<i> question rapidly as we want to use the answer to post it to the
</I>&gt;<i> crossroad website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ouff, the more I go on the more I feel I should be doing this full time...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
