<PRE>Back on the topic of the xroad.

This is where they called the question:
<A HREF="http://crossroad.epu.ntua.gr/blog/2010/10/08/which-are-the-key-ict-research-challenges-for-governance-and-policy-making-have-your-say/">http://crossroad.epu.ntua.gr/blog/2010/10/08/which-are-the-key-ict-research-challenges-for-governance-and-policy-making-have-your-say/</A>

we posted out point at the additional challenge. I chose that because
I did not agree on their division of the problem in 4 areas.

We are now at 36 points, and counting, and growing. The highest other
has 26 points that they painstakingly got in 2 weeks time. We reached
36 points in 24 hours. We are really running the risk to win this.

Then what? Seriously, shall we discuss the possible after outcome.

If I were in them I would invite the person (or the community) that
has suggested the challenge to come and explain better what did they
mean. After all those descriptions are really short. Will they do it?
If they do it, how can we make sure that we all participate in the
answer? Or shall one of us (which probably would be me, as the name on
the question is mine) go there.

My claim is that we are much much in front of them. And we should show
it to them by showing that we are able to take collaborative
decisions, in little time. One week is enough for us. We have done it
this time, we can do it again.

If instead I (or someone else) just goes there and gives a
presentation at least the presentation should be prepared together.

I am not sure about this, but I think those are the people that wan
the EU fundings we applied for 2 years ago. When in the application,
as a side effect, we got Vilfredo started.

I am not sure they really will welcome our input. Nor do I think the
EU is so open to it either.

We are winning this battle, but let's think strategically, what are
the next step we should do?

Your thoughts?

Pietro
