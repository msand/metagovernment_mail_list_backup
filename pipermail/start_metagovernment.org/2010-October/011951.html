<PRE>Here's an item of interest:

I've been taking a look at this Common Cause report by the WWF today. (PDF)
<A HREF="http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/common_cause_report.pdf">http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/common_cause_report.pdf</A>

Using empirical survey data, it looks at various life-goals and values held
by individuals and explores how they are related to different pairs of &quot;deep
frames&quot;. The frames are to do with &quot;how particular sets of values are
carried about in people&#8217;s minds, and how they are used in communication and
social interaction.&quot; One of the frame pairs explored in the report is &quot;Elite
governance&quot; vs. &quot;Participatory democracy&quot;.

Here's a copy/paste of a very interesting part (from page 55), where it
lists the values most closely linked to Elite governance, and those most
closely linked to Participatory democracy:

3.5.3 &#8216;Elite governance&#8217; and &#8216;Participative democracy&#8217; frames
These two frames determine the views that people hold about the role of
government
in public decision-making. Is power properly concentrated in the hands of
well-educated
elites who are best placed to take decisions in the common interest? Or
does the concentration of power risk decision-making processes being
captured, such
that these serve to promote the interests of particular groups in society?

*Elite governance frame*
Political power is properly consolidated in the hands of elites. People
cannot be
trusted to solve their own problems: leaders must take control and act on
their
behalf. The political world is therefore properly structured as a top-down
hierarchy.
Democracy must be carefully managed if governance is not reduced to mob
rule,
and people must be encouraged to accept the current order. One mechanism
for managing democracy is to deflect public agency into the marketplace &#8211;
with
an emphasis on being &#8216;good consumers&#8217; rather than &#8216;good citizens&#8217; (instead
of
complaining about the intransigence of political leaders, the electorate is
encouraged
to express its values through different product choices). In fact, the
voting process
itself may be heavily influenced by marketing techniques &#8211; such that
citizens
are &#8216;sold&#8217; the candidates and policies of the elite. Civil society
organisations are
unaccountable and their influence should be narrowly circumscribed.

This frame is associated with the following items in the values surveys
discussed
in Section 2 and Appendix 1. The goal or value associated with each item is
given in
parenthesis. I will achieve the &#8216;look&#8217; I have been after (image); authority
(the right
to lead or command), social power (control over others, dominance), and
observing
social norms (to maintain face) are important guiding principles in my life
(power);
I will be polite and obedient; my desires and tastes will be similar to
those of other
people; I will &#8216;fit in&#8217; with others (conformity).

Common Cause page 56

*Participative democracy frame*
People hold political power, and should exert their influence through
effective
organisation. The government is of the people, by the people, and for the
people.
Citizens are part of the collaborative decision-making processes, and they
grow and
struggle together in the process of personal transformation and as they
develop
a collective sense of the ideals towards which they wish to aspire. Civil
society
organisations provide one avenue for people to self-organise and express
their
collective aspirations. Such organisations are essential to ensure that
politicians
remain accountable, and to push forward community interests.

This frame is associated with the following items in the values surveys
discussed
in Section 2 and Appendix 1. The goal or value associated with each item is
given
in parenthesis. I will choose what I do, instead of being pushed along by
life; I will
have insight into why I do the things I do (self-acceptance); independent
thought
and action, choosing, creating and exploring are important guiding
principles in
my life (self-direction).
