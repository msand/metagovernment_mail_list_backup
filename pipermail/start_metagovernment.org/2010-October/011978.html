</I>
It's not a rhetorical question, since I don't know the answer.
Perhaps - as you say - widening participation would increase a sense
of issue-ownership, and decrease cooperation.  Perhaps if people
didn't feel like their input was being completely thrown out, because
the system was able to recognise different levels of input, then there
would be a corresponding increase in compromise.  My feeling is that
we would see more of the latter.

But my feeling is useless since I have nothing solid to back it up.


&gt;&gt;<i> There is a problem of recursion here - if you can't find consensus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the tenets, then you'd need to first work out the meta-tenets,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and perhaps the meta-meta-tenets, etc. &#160;But I wonder if Michael is an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exception here, or if simply the knowledge that your higher-level
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input is embedded into the details of a final decision you wouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> otherwise support, would enable more people to act the same way and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> join the consensus?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot even parse this.
</I>
Well say one of your tenets is that the name shouldn't include the
&quot;e-&quot; prefix.  As it stands, with a handful of participants, it's
realistic to have a list-serv or site-hosted discussion and gain
consensus.  But at a certain scale, individuals form into factions
around issues, and become less responsive to appeals to compromise.  I
think the only way to combat that is to increase the number of issues,
and thus dilute the power of factions.

For example the pro &quot;e-&quot; faction may be part of a consensus on a
mini-issue like &quot;the name should be clearly understandable to a wide
audience today&quot;.  So you link in a few more issues and build an
argument - &quot;the name should be as future-proof as possible&quot;, and &quot;the
e-prefix is already becoming old-fashioned - e.g. you've got mail!&quot;.

It's intuitive to me to say that this would invite competing
arguments.  Then you've no-longer got a big pro/anti issue but a
larger set of smaller ones - if an individual is part of the consensus
on 3 out of 4 mini-issues, then they wouldn't they find it easier to
compromise on the last one?

As much as I agree with you about the necessity for a modus operandi,
I think a system which doesn't take account of the petty side of human
nature, will fall victim to it.  I think it's safer to assume that
none of us will ever follow any modus operandi 100%.


&gt;&gt;<i> Synthesis isn't all-or-nothing, but with a single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conceptual layer of choices, it feels that way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is something I can answer. It is possible to consider multiple
</I>&gt;<i> voting, like rating the answers, or ordering them. But I have a
</I>&gt;<i> _strong_ intuition (funded on some partial math results) that the
</I>&gt;<i> result of this would be that the Pareto Front would grow a lot, even
</I>&gt;<i> to become the whole list of all the proposals. At the end an all or
</I>&gt;<i> nothing seem to be the most acceptable solution. You decide where the
</I>&gt;<i> threshold for something to be acceptable is. But you are invited to
</I>&gt;<i> put it as low as it is actually acceptable.
</I>
If there is no hierarchy to the issues, then I agree.  If some issues
are structured to cancel and supersede others, then you mitigate that
problem, since only the top branches of the tree are used to calculate
the front.  How to fairly construct that tree is a different problem,
and one I've been hacking away at for a few years now with only
moderate success.


&gt;&gt;<i> Given that, a question-framing process seems helpful if not downright
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary if we ever hope to scale to larger communities.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, what does question framing mean? Do you mean collaboratively
</I>&gt;<i> writing/editing the question?
</I>
Just copy+pasting from Yahoo Answers:
&quot;Who do you want Obama or McCain to be America's next President?&quot;
&quot;Do you want someone with more experience or less experience to be the
next president?&quot;

The way you construct/frame the same question can affect the answers
that you get, even if you're giving the initial impression of
impartiality.


&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, there's also the risk that locking-in to one question might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hinder synthesis...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does locking-in mean?
</I>
Singling out/ targetting/ ending up with just one.


&gt;&gt;<i> This is an answer to the old adage &quot;the system that created the problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cannot solve the problem&quot; or however it goes. &#160;This idea is that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quesiton need to match the perceived conditions, and the response needs be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at least as complex as the question. &#160;Elsewise, repeat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, this is incorrect. For example in Science you have very simple
</I>&gt;<i> questions (how did life arise on earth?), with very complex answers,
</I>&gt;<i> and very complex questions with very simple answers (take any long
</I>&gt;<i> equation whose answer is 2). Something that is important is that there
</I>&gt;<i> is no &quot;conservation of complexity&quot; principle in Nature; complex causes
</I>&gt;<i> can have simple effects and simple causes can have complex outcomes.
</I>&gt;<i> That's why it's so interesting.
</I>
I could give the correct answer &quot;2&quot; in a math exam but get no marks
for it because I failed to show my working.

If an answer doesn't address each and every point raised in a
question, then it is incomplete regardless of whether it is &quot;correct&quot;.
 Describing this in terms of complexity seems a bit confusing,
assuming we're talking about the same thing!


&gt;&gt;<i> The question will be re-framed by the answers, explanations and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussions it generates. &#160;This is to be expected when exploration of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the problem space discovers information not initially available. &#160;This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will happen with or without a formal/automated process for re-framing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the question. &#160;But I agree - a system designed with this in mind will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be more scalable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you are suggesting a system where people can change a question
</I>&gt;<i> while the question is running?
</I>
I'm saying that it happens already inside the minds of the
participants, as they come to their own interpretations of what the
question means.  But the system has no way to record it other than
opaque discussion, and no way to make direct use of it.


&gt;&gt;<i> I would also argue that such a system would provide better results.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If a question is re-framed only in the minds of the participants - and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not in some tangible form - then the participants will be providing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answers for different questions, and trying to fit all those into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same slot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seem to be a risk
</I>
I haven't proved that such a system is feasible.  Is that the risk you
are referring to?

Richard
