I'm hesitant to go into too much detail until I have a working
prototype, not least because my theory may be bunk ;-)  But it sounds
like there's some cross-over in our efforts.  Probably not least
because I've been most inspired by Votorola, in particular the
proxy-voting theory.

The basic idea I'm working on is that everything is a set or group of
similar things.  This can be as generic or as specific as desired -
e.g. the &quot;group of people who are republicans&quot; or &quot;the group of
republicans who are under 30 years old&quot;.  In order to determine the
members of a group the user selects a set of conditions - candidates
for membership are tested against those conditions.  To be a member of
&quot;the group of republicans who are under 30 years old&quot;, you'd likely
need to be a member of &quot;the group of republicans&quot; and &quot;the group of
people under 30 years old&quot;.  Except that I expect people to try to
game the system, so rather than design some natural-language parsing,
or check all data against some knowledge-base, that group membership
could instead have the bogus condition &quot;the group of people who are
called Rob&quot;, and the system would do nothing to prevent that.  If I am
a democratic operative who is trying to appeal to young republicans,
I'm going to quickly discover that I'm being duped, and I'll construct
my own &quot;really real group of republicans under 30&quot; group, and go from
there.

Groups can be private or public, this just means that the membership
conditions are either controlled by the owners of that group (as
initially determined by the person who created the group), or if
public then there is an additional set of conditions which control
changes to the membership condition - e.g.  &quot;66 percent of 'the group
of people active in political discussion' must agree to any changes&quot; -
so in practice, you'd avoid pranks like that mentioned above.
Privately held groups would not have much use in public discussion
except where it reflects a private grouping of people - e.g. political
parties should have the freedom to choose their own members using
whatever methods they deem appropriate.

By forming a hierarchy of groupings, the expression can get quite
esoteric and reflect complex beliefs - e.g. &quot;All human life is sacred
and should be preserved at all costs&quot;.  So what you'd end up with is,
say, in an abortion debate an individual may uphold that belief - but
are then forced to contradict themselves when participating in a
debate about capital punishment, healthcare, or war.

This is the crux of the system.  A user is free to contradict
themselves as much as they want, but it is all on the record.  You can
then create &quot;the group of people who changed their condition for this
particular vote&quot;.  In addition, you may create &quot;actionable items&quot; from
opinion, but issues aren't static, and neither are they closed.  So if
a faction of people decided to contradict themselves to win on a new
issue, old issues which had depended upon those votes would be
automatically be brought into question.

I'm skipping a lot of detail here, and I hope it isn't too obtuse,
certainly the UI will hide the complexity of what I have described.
But to summarise - in order to construct argument trees supporting a
position, I allow the users the freedom to construct their own or
support an existing tree.  In order to keep this process fair,
hypocrisy is discouraged by recording all votes and built into the
system is a mechanism to both determine and highlight instances of
gaming.
