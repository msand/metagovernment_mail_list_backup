<PRE>Hi Paul,

You know what would be needed? A manual on how to write a question for Vilfredo.

We know it has to be an open question, but it's more than that. Some
questions are only apparently open, and we had an example with the
question on the name that we discussed before. If a question has many
alternatives, but a finite number, it will not permit itself to let
people find a real compromise, then the system should find all the
possible alternative and then go with a Condorcet voting.

But then there are other situations where questions are not really effective...
for example when the question is not well specified, or there are
presupposition from the person who writes the question.
Someone who has the time should look into the history of the questions
and come up with examples.

Also another example of something that at present does not work well.
Everybody here is telling how there should be a discussion board along
side with the decision board. Well, a friend has decided to use
Vilfredo for a decision in a group. But first he implemented a mailing
list. People are so successfully deciding in the mailing list that I
am doubting Vilfredo will ever be useful there. Now you might think,
well who cares, if the mailing list is letting them decide, what use
do we have of Vilfredo. But the problem is that Vilfredo is set up to
be fair, giving to each person equal weight by the voting system. In
the mailing list people have an influence that is in general directly
proportional to the work they are willing to do and how much do they
speak. SO people who silently dissent have a weight on vilfredo but no
weight on a mailing list. Something that is making me wonder...


Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to invite you to help refine the answers - often I'm paraphrasing

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please also post new questions and/or answers, bearing in mind the aims for
</I>&gt;<i> the FAQ page which I outlined earlier:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) To explain what is quite a complicated idea in bite-sized chunks, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What does the name Metagovernment mean?&quot;, &quot;What is meant by radical
</I>&gt;<i> transparency?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 2) To anticipate and counter some of the preconceptions people have about
</I>&gt;<i> what Metagovernment is and how it would (not) work, e.g. &quot;Won't people be
</I>&gt;<i> influenced to vote a certain way by the media?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 3) To present questions which have more than one competing answer, e.g. &quot;Do
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous interactions have a place within the metagovernment?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 4) To imagine parts of the project which have not been implemented, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;How will discussion take place?&quot; (This question is currently being
</I>&gt;<i> discussed in Vilfredo - hopefully we'll reach an answer which can be posted
</I>&gt;<i> on the Metagovernement FAQ)
