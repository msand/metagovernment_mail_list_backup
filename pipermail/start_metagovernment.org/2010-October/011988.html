</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a certain group based on who votes and how as a subgroup of all voters
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and their votes. ?Building a tree, a separate tree, for that group, is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not really fair, but is certainly &quot;practical&quot; from a limited
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perspective. ?As an example, they only care about the discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happening amongst qualified voters, qualified within their group, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at least there's an argument that this is all they care about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hesitant to go into too much detail until I have a working
</I>&gt;<i> prototype, not least because my theory may be bunk ;-)  But it sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like there's some cross-over in our efforts.  Probably not least
</I>&gt;<i> because I've been most inspired by Votorola, in particular the
</I>&gt;<i> proxy-voting theory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The basic idea I'm working on is that everything is a set or group of
</I>&gt;<i> similar things.  This can be as generic or as specific as desired -
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. the &quot;group of people who are republicans&quot; or &quot;the group of
</I>&gt;<i> republicans who are under 30 years old&quot;.  In order to determine the
</I>&gt;<i> members of a group the user selects a set of conditions - candidates
</I>&gt;<i> for membership are tested against those conditions.  To be a member of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the group of republicans who are under 30 years old&quot;, you'd likely
</I>&gt;<i> need to be a member of &quot;the group of republicans&quot; and &quot;the group of
</I>&gt;<i> people under 30 years old&quot;.  Except that I expect people to try to
</I>&gt;<i> game the system, so rather than design some natural-language parsing,
</I>&gt;<i> or check all data against some knowledge-base, that group membership
</I>&gt;<i> could instead have the bogus condition &quot;the group of people who are
</I>&gt;<i> called Rob&quot;, and the system would do nothing to prevent that.  If I am
</I>&gt;<i> a democratic operative who is trying to appeal to young republicans,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to quickly discover that I'm being duped, and I'll construct
</I>&gt;<i> my own &quot;really real group of republicans under 30&quot; group, and go from
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Groups can be private or public, this just means that the membership
</I>&gt;<i> conditions are either controlled by the owners of that group (as
</I>&gt;<i> initially determined by the person who created the group), or if
</I>&gt;<i> public then there is an additional set of conditions which control
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the membership condition - e.g.  &quot;66 percent of 'the group
</I>&gt;<i> of people active in political discussion' must agree to any changes&quot; -
</I>&gt;<i> so in practice, you'd avoid pranks like that mentioned above.
</I>&gt;<i> Privately held groups would not have much use in public discussion
</I>&gt;<i> except where it reflects a private grouping of people - e.g. political
</I>&gt;<i> parties should have the freedom to choose their own members using
</I>&gt;<i> whatever methods they deem appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By forming a hierarchy of groupings, the expression can get quite
</I>&gt;<i> esoteric and reflect complex beliefs - e.g. &quot;All human life is sacred
</I>&gt;<i> and should be preserved at all costs&quot;.  So what you'd end up with is,
</I>&gt;<i> say, in an abortion debate an individual may uphold that belief - but
</I>&gt;<i> are then forced to contradict themselves when participating in a
</I>&gt;<i> debate about capital punishment, healthcare, or war.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is the crux of the system.  A user is free to contradict
</I>&gt;<i> themselves as much as they want, but it is all on the record.  You can
</I>&gt;<i> then create &quot;the group of people who changed their condition for this
</I>&gt;<i> particular vote&quot;.  In addition, you may create &quot;actionable items&quot; from
</I>&gt;<i> opinion, but issues aren't static, and neither are they closed.  So if
</I>&gt;<i> a faction of people decided to contradict themselves to win on a new
</I>&gt;<i> issue, old issues which had depended upon those votes would be
</I>&gt;<i> automatically be brought into question.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm skipping a lot of detail here, and I hope it isn't too obtuse,
</I>&gt;<i> certainly the UI will hide the complexity of what I have described.
</I>&gt;<i> But to summarise - in order to construct argument trees supporting a
</I>&gt;<i> position, I allow the users the freedom to construct their own or
</I>&gt;<i> support an existing tree.  In order to keep this process fair,
</I>&gt;<i> hypocrisy is discouraged by recording all votes and built into the
</I>&gt;<i> system is a mechanism to both determine and highlight instances of
</I>&gt;<i> gaming.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Zury, welcome to the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think most of us are aware of the difficulties in using the mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list. The wiki was develped just to smooth out those difficulties. But
</I>&gt;<i> all in all the question remains, what CMS should metagovernment use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have an open question that was raised some time ago. The question
</I>&gt;<i> is now a bit old, but it's still valid. Why don't you go there and
</I>&gt;<i> write your proposal. If we all find an agreement (probably after a
</I>&gt;<i> couple of generations) we could then implement what we all agree on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The question is at:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that it might seem that I am responding to your critic
</I>&gt;<i> about our disucssion being private by refering to some older
</I>&gt;<i> discussion, but really you just need to read the question, login and
</I>&gt;<i> add your proposal. There is really not much need to learn much more.
</I>&gt;<i> And then we can all solve this problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Welcome again, and thanks for your input!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
No problem Pietro, I have made my proposal in Vilfredo. 
Will the issue be debated and decided there or here or somewhere else?

Zury.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Zury, as another outsider, I can't recommend this enough - just
</I>&gt;<i> stick your nose in and participate in any debate which captures your
</I>&gt;<i> interest.  I find this list to be very civil and respectful.  Now this
</I>&gt;<i> isn't meant to diminish what you say about semi-private dialog, but I
</I>&gt;<i> do think that will occur amongst a small group of core contributers,
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of the venue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I'd like to see the migration from this list to be to a
</I>&gt;<i> permanent new home.  Online communities tend to fracture with each
</I>&gt;<i> move, and multiple moves can be fatal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With regards the list you provided - I took a look at a few, but I
</I>&gt;<i> still don't know of any participation medium that can scale up as to
</I>&gt;<i> be sufficiently future-proof.  I mean yes - a platform that organises
</I>&gt;<i> content in different subjects and groups, allows for tagging and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;liking&quot; and all that, would be an incremental step up from what we
</I>&gt;<i> have now.  Today.  But that wouldn't scale up to allow meaningful
</I>&gt;<i> individual participation for a majority of users, at the scale of a
</I>&gt;<i> city.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You may care about the environment, but you've got less motivation to
</I>&gt;<i> participate in a city-wide forum, when you're just going to get
</I>&gt;<i> ignored and your input lost in the noise.  But - for example - if the
</I>&gt;<i> system was able to recognise you as the environmental go-to-person
</I>&gt;<i> amongst a core group of your friends, then you've got some motivation
</I>&gt;<i> to specialise your knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This sort of scaling is a natural progression that we're starting to
</I>&gt;<i> see in social networks.  You are no longer connected with just your
</I>&gt;<i> friends, but you get to see content/comments from your
</I>&gt;<i> friends-of-friends.  AFAIK (I haven't logged on in ages) Facebook
</I>&gt;<i> isn't doing anything with foaf2 (friends-of-a-friend-of-a-friend) data
</I>&gt;<i> yet other than friend recommendations - I expect to see it become
</I>&gt;<i> widespread there first though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But to take the example above - you'd now find yourself, as the
</I>&gt;<i> go-to-person for environmental issues, in a small core group comprised
</I>&gt;<i> of the environmentalists nominated by all the friends of your friends.
</I>&gt;<i> And you could keep extending that further until you've covered the
</I>&gt;<i> entire city/country/solar system - the point being that there is a
</I>&gt;<i> core group, and associated status, available to you corresponding to
</I>&gt;<i> your level of participation.  This is an aside - but I think this
</I>&gt;<i> would be a great foundation for issue-based proxy-voting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I expect we'll be seeing platforms integrate more foafx features
</I>&gt;<i> relatively soon, and I'd fully support a switch to a platform which
</I>&gt;<i> was scalable in that manner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, more controversially - core groups are, I think, essential to
</I>&gt;<i> getting anything done in the absence of the collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making systems we hope to create.  Having just 100x the
</I>&gt;<i> number of active users on this mailing list would make it very hard
</I>&gt;<i> for an existing core group to communicate and maintain their
</I>&gt;<i> relationships which would affect their ability to achieve the same
</I>&gt;<i> goals.  I'm not talking about turning people away, but in my opinion
</I>&gt;<i> it's not altogether a bad thing (for now) that the active population
</I>&gt;<i> is self-regulating.

</I>&gt;<i> is, rather than giving a moment's thought to actual solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see this a lot. People are very ready to say that democracy is dead.  
</I>&gt;<i> Then I present them with a hint of our project, and they immediately  
</I>&gt;<i> launch into criticisms of how it fails to be completely perfect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see from the numbers below, people continue to come to  
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment.org in decent numbers. But getting them interested in  
</I>&gt;<i> the message is a real, heavy challenge. (To be specific, well over 100  
</I>&gt;<i> people come to the site each day... and our list has 117 members).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am open to suggestions for how we can market more effectively. I'm  
</I>&gt;<i> getting people to the site, but as we've noted before, it's message  
</I>&gt;<i> still isn't working. We may just have to prove ourselves before anyone  
</I>&gt;<i> will believe us, but... it would be nice if we could make our case  
</I>&gt;<i> more effectively.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far, my suggestion (sidelined by my ridiculously pressed schedule  
</I>&gt;<i> this year) has been:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-06/v2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-06/v2</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but it is a primitive first draft.
