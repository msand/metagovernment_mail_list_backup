Oh boy, I am equally lost. Again is this a rhetorical question? (mine is
not!)
My understanding is that we tried to answer the question posed. When
this did not work we moved into the meta level, and then we happen to
stumble upon an answer that was acceptable by all. We should all just
vote for ALL the proposals that were acceptable, regardless if they
were proposals, meta proposals, and so on. If you have followed this
principle in this question, on this generation, we would have had a
consensus. Instead by only voting your own proposals, even though we
had other proposals that were acceptable we went near the consensus
without the algorithm finding it.

Please understand, I am not finger pointing at you, we are all
learning to use this tool together. Maybe the tool should list the
people who voted only for their own proposal, or only for one
proposal.

MM here:  Are you focusing upon the last question, or on the distinctions I
lay out for myself in addressing the particular questions for a &quot;phrase&quot; and
the &quot;criteria&quot; for phrase as posed?

The question clearly had two components -- seeking a phrase, and seeking
criteria.

for my part -- I affirm that &quot;Open Democracy&quot; does not violate the more
important elements of the criteria I applied when proposing a phrase or
supporting others, however I don't fully support it, either.  As the sole
outlier I am not interested in blocking this work, and the phrase does not
make me feel I must oppose it for the greater good.



&gt;<i> We don't need full consensus on the wording/semantics there.
</I>
I can't parse this too.

MM here:  the ultimate output from this particular inquiry was to be a
phrase or word that suits and could substitute for &quot;open source democracy&quot;
-- so, our explanatory statements and definitions in each proposal play a
supportive role.  They don't stick to the output necessarily, and we don't
have to agree on the wording or semantics of these support statements in
order to agree on the phrase that results.

What struck me as odd was when a proposal had support from other
participants at one stage and then no further support even when new
proposals were not added.

&gt;<i> So, any of our higher level input doesn't necessarily stick to the output
</I>in
&gt;<i> the way we'd like unless we all have shared commitment to it doing so.
</I> (And
&gt;<i> it seems to me we do -- which is why are here after all)
</I>
Uhm?

MM again: covered above --
