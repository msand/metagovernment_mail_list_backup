<PRE>Hi Richard, thanks for the explanations.


&gt;<i> Well say one of your tenets is that the name shouldn't include the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;e-&quot; prefix. &#160;As it stands, with a handful of participants, it's
</I>&gt;<i> realistic to have a list-serv or site-hosted discussion and gain
</I>&gt;<i> consensus. &#160;But at a certain scale, individuals form into factions
</I>&gt;<i> around issues, and become less responsive to appeals to compromise. &#160;I
</I>&gt;<i> think the only way to combat that is to increase the number of issues,
</I>&gt;<i> and thus dilute the power of factions.
</I>

This is a really interesting topic, because so far we have not seen
the appearance of parties on vilfredo.
It might be because it is too early, or because the questions did not
ask for them. But I have my own theory.

You see, an important element is Vilfredo is that proposals are
anonymous when they are being voted. As such
people vote more respect to what they truly believe than respect to
agreeing to some party affiliation. In fact if the system was to grow
to the point to include thousands of participants, and it should scale
in a form of distributed network, this should be written right in the
code. SO that no one could know which proposal he will evaluate, and
no one can invite another to vote for their proposal. People can
convince each other of a particular point, but not point to a
particular proposal that embodies that point.

Also parties seem to come together with the process of summing up
votes, after all the bigger your party is, the more power you have.
But in Vilfredo each user has already plenty of power, the power to
write one proposal directly in the pareto front and to veto all other
proposals to reach consensus. Maybe that's why we don't form parties.

Still at times we have observed the appearance of a polarity in the
proposal. This is different from the parties in the sense that the
people agreeing on one topic in one question seldom agree on another
topic in another question. It's like if me and you share on think (say
we are both libra), but then on the topic of soccer, I share my
affiliation with the soccer club with Ed.

When this type of polarity appears my suggestion is that eventually
the question is interrupted or frozen (we still need to implement a
frozen system), and the pareto front of the proposals in the last
round be used as the alternative answers to be voted in a Condorcet
voting round. We admit that we are unable to reach an agreement, but
instead of having someone from above decide what are the alternatives,
those are defined by the process, and then the voting happens.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example the pro &quot;e-&quot; faction may be part of a consensus on a
</I>&gt;<i> mini-issue like &quot;the name should be clearly understandable to a wide
</I>&gt;<i> audience today&quot;. &#160;So you link in a few more issues and build an
</I>&gt;<i> argument - &quot;the name should be as future-proof as possible&quot;, and &quot;the
</I>&gt;<i> e-prefix is already becoming old-fashioned - e.g. you've got mail!&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's intuitive to me to say that this would invite competing
</I>&gt;<i> arguments. &#160;Then you've no-longer got a big pro/anti issue but a
</I>&gt;<i> larger set of smaller ones - if an individual is part of the consensus
</I>&gt;<i> on 3 out of 4 mini-issues, then they wouldn't they find it easier to
</I>&gt;<i> compromise on the last one?
</I>
I am not sure on this one. Of course if a person got it his way on
some elements, then he is usually willing to give up on the others.
But the assumption here is that things are either yes or no. Either we
use the term e- or we don't. In some cases this is not the case (like
you can accept to use both)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As much as I agree with you about the necessity for a modus operandi,
</I>&gt;<i> I think a system which doesn't take account of the petty side of human
</I>&gt;<i> nature, will fall victim to it. &#160;I think it's safer to assume that
</I>&gt;<i> none of us will ever follow any modus operandi 100%.
</I>
As I said, Vilfredo system, because of its voting system might have
different problems than traditional voting systems.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Synthesis isn't all-or-nothing, but with a single
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> conceptual layer of choices, it feels that way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is something I can answer. It is possible to consider multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting, like rating the answers, or ordering them. But I have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _strong_ intuition (funded on some partial math results) that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> result of this would be that the Pareto Front would grow a lot, even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to become the whole list of all the proposals. At the end an all or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing seem to be the most acceptable solution. You decide where the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threshold for something to be acceptable is. But you are invited to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> put it as low as it is actually acceptable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there is no hierarchy to the issues, then I agree. &#160;If some issues
</I>&gt;<i> are structured to cancel and supersede others, then you mitigate that
</I>&gt;<i> problem, since only the top branches of the tree are used to calculate
</I>&gt;<i> the front. &#160;How to fairly construct that tree is a different problem,
</I>&gt;<i> and one I've been hacking away at for a few years now with only
</I>&gt;<i> moderate success.
</I>
I think this is becoming to abstract for now. I am considering to
introduce relation between proposals. But the fact that everybody need
to also agree on what the relation is is making this quite difficult.
For example:
proposal A: let's go to Paris
proposal B: let's go to France

Of course A implies B. So if someone votes for A we can assume (or
invite) that he votes also for B. But there are other situation where
not everybody agrees on the implications. It will be eventually
implemented. But not until I have fully worked out the maths around it
:<i>-).
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Given that, a question-framing process seems helpful if not downright
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> necessary if we ever hope to scale to larger communities.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, what does question framing mean? Do you mean collaboratively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> writing/editing the question?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just copy+pasting from Yahoo Answers:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Who do you want Obama or McCain to be America's next President?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Do you want someone with more experience or less experience to be the
</I>&gt;<i> next president?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way you construct/frame the same question can affect the answers
</I>&gt;<i> that you get, even if you're giving the initial impression of
</I>&gt;<i> impartiality.
</I>
Great example. In VIlfredo the solution so far has been:
Question: &quot;what question should we ask to find out what do people want to vote&quot;

And even if someone asked:
&quot;what question should we ask to find out if people want a more
experienced candidate or a less experienced candidate for the white
house?&quot;

Still the answer could be the same, or at least it could be something like:
&quot;Who do you want to be America's next President? Consider in
particular the reference to the experience of the candidate&quot;

In other word when you ask a meta question you might be giving just
enough elbow movement that the right question is being asked.

But is really long, so I am open to alternatives


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, there's also the risk that locking-in to one question might
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hinder synthesis...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What does locking-in mean?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Singling out/ targetting/ ending up with just one.
</I>
We are speaking about singling out a question, not a proposal right?
There is no system in Vilfredo that stops people from writing
competing questions, that rephrame the same question in different
ways.

If instead we are speaking about the need to reach consensus, yes,
unfortunately to reach consensus you need to reach consensus, but
sometimes we have found that we all agreed on more than one proposal.
In general they were easily integrated into a bigger complex one.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is an answer to the old adage &quot;the system that created the problem
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cannot solve the problem&quot; or however it goes. &#160;This idea is that ...
</I>
Honestly, can we ignore all this. I know the quote from Einstein,
&quot;No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.&quot;
 but I find it a bit too general to apply it easily.

Once you find me a way to measure what &quot;level of consciousness&quot; means,
I might change position...
in the meantime :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The question will be re-framed by the answers, explanations and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discussions it generates. &#160;This is to be expected when exploration of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the problem space discovers information not initially available. &#160;This
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will happen with or without a formal/automated process for re-framing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the question. &#160;But I agree - a system designed with this in mind will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be more scalable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So you are suggesting a system where people can change a question
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while the question is running?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm saying that it happens already inside the minds of the
</I>&gt;<i> participants, as they come to their own interpretations of what the
</I>&gt;<i> question means. &#160;But the system has no way to record it other than
</I>&gt;<i> opaque discussion, and no way to make direct use of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would also argue that such a system would provide better results.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If a question is re-framed only in the minds of the participants - and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not in some tangible form - then the participants will be providing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> answers for different questions, and trying to fit all those into the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> same slot.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This seem to be a risk
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't proved that such a system is feasible. &#160;Is that the risk you
</I>&gt;<i> are referring to?
</I>
No, the risk is that if people change the question while it is running
they might end up answering something which is totally unrelated to
the question posed by the OP.
