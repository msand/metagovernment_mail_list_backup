<PRE>SO you have all seen that the question on the name of the kind of
democracy we are trying to build has moved on. Interestingly this time
we seem to all agree except for Michael.

To be fully honest there are also less person that has participated
this time than the previous one.
In any case now we seem to have a near agreement for &quot;Open Democracy&quot;,
with the explanation that it would fit nicely on the wikipedia list of
democracy types.

Of course we can't claim that we reached consensus if we don't have
100%. So now it's Michael's call.

Michael, could you please either rewrite the proposal you did not
like, in a way that it would fit you? Or just explain what you think
it's unacceptable about it, and then we try to walk around the
difficulties you are having?

If you look at the Key players, it also confirms this. It says:
MichaelMaranda  ( 1707 )
meaning MichaelMaranda should rewrite the proposal 1707.

Of course anybody else who feels like contributing go for it.

Many thanks to all,
Pietro
