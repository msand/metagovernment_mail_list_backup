<PRE>IDEA!

Hi Ed,

&gt;&gt;<i> The question will be re-framed by the answers, explanations and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussions it generates. &#160;This is to be expected when exploration of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the problem space discovers information not initially available. &#160;This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will happen with or without a formal/automated process for re-framing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the question. &#160;But I agree - a system designed with this in mind will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be more scalable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in Vilfredo, I think this would involve a third stage to each round. Or
</I>&gt;<i> at least a meta-round that interjects into the process after every few
</I>&gt;<i> rounds of back-and-forth.
</I>
so what if we permit to users to open a new question, from an existing one.

Maybe the two questions could be linked, so that people who are
answering to one could be invited to answer to the other. And even
from the website the link would be present. Also the person should
have a shortcut to repropose a proposal that has already been
presented in the first one.

If this is programmed well it would permit to people to have multiple
versions of the same question.

The risk of course is that opposing people would find it easier to
rewrite the question than to bridge their differences.

I am still thinking aloud...
