<PRE>In the Votorola project we've been working on the specification for
the prototype of something called &quot;crossforum theatre&quot;.

While one purpose of the project is to allow voters to use any
discussion media in order to continue discussion of a position or
poll,

another purpose is to provide a set of methods for easily accessing
the current discussions on a position, to follow the discourse, and,
in later prototypes, to engage through a variety of interfaces (web
browser, mobile, in person).

The issue of &quot;traversing a tree&quot;, of discovering the variety and
texture of positions within a poll submitted by other candidates,
seems to be a ... well, it's something worth looking at.  I'd be
interested in hearing how this fits into what Richard said earlier
about how to &quot;faily construct the tree.&quot;  One issue I have seen is
that a certain poll may have filters on the votes, filters that
disregard other voters, and rebuild the tree.  This information is not
necessarily held within a raw vote count, and may have to do with
processing the votes after votes are cast; how a poll is actionable to
a certain group based on who votes and how as a subgroup of all voters
and their votes.  Building a tree, a separate tree, for that group, is
not really fair, but is certainly &quot;practical&quot; from a limited
perspective.  As an example, they only care about the discussion
happening amongst qualified voters, qualified within their group, or
at least there's an argument that this is all they care about.
