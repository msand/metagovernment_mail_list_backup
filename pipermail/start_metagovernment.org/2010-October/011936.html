I will say that I've been in a similar position for the last three
years now.  Frustratingly, that last &quot;10-15%&quot; kept thwarting my actual
implementation attempts.  So in the last six months I've started
delving into that &quot;10-15%&quot; - trying to work out all the kinks
manually.  Somewhat predictably that last 10% is taking 90% of the
time to work out!

I think that ratio is more of a general law than an exception.


&gt;<i> The problem is that writing
</I>&gt;<i> it out with sufficient rigor in a research paper is *itself* coding
</I>&gt;<i> it, and the time and energy seems much better spend just *doing* it.
</I>
I can empathise with that.  I do think though, that you don't need to
be writing a research paper in order to test your theory with
methodological rigor.  Of course, if you have the latter, the former
would almost write itself.


&gt;<i> The battle at times for me is how much to make public so that the
</I>&gt;<i> timing of roll-out can be sufficient aligned with the overall vision
</I>&gt;<i> rather than being usurped by corporate (or other interests) whose
</I>&gt;<i> visions really aren't in harmony with the project. &#160;It would be tragic
</I>&gt;<i> to see great ideas and spirit taken again into walled gardens of
</I>&gt;<i> corporate domains and the overall vision starved due to
</I>&gt;<i> attention-deprivation. &#160;In this regard, the lessons of the first
</I>&gt;<i> internet wave (and crash) are duly noted.
</I>
My take on this is that there are so many (mostly untested) ideas out
there, that this scenario is highly unlikely at this stage.  Not least
because one guaranteed way to generate attention right now is to play
a David against a mean corporate Goliath who has stolen your work!
But also because, frankly, I think it's such an impossible task to
take all of this confusing input and see the &quot;one true path&quot;.  I'd be
surprised if anyone on this list has a complete vision yet, or even
theory which is more than 91% tested ;-)
