Thanks Giovani,
I stand corrected.

By the way, we just reached 45 point, also I presume with your help. Thanks.
(And thanks to everybody else who also voted).

One question:

&gt;<i> Not sure how good it is to share all these ideas that came out from public collaboration with anyone that cannot guarantee the freedom it needs to work on large scale.
</I>
Weren't you suggesting that we publish the proposal as a book? Maybe
now it would be the right time to do it. But of course if you are
afraid that our ideas might be misused...

I have recently (yesterday) started a blog on Vilfredo (
<A HREF="http://blog.vilfredo.org">http://blog.vilfredo.org</A> ). It is meant to be the blog where I
describe the philosophy behind vilfredo, why things are the way they
are, a review of the questions as they appear, and a review of the
eGov work I get in touch with. From time to time I will also like to
invite other people to write entries. Maybe you could write about
Eugager at some point :-).

&gt;<i> Ifyou do havemoreinfo on who they are and what they intend to do as an outcome of the project please let us know...
</I>
I surely would.

Cheers,
Pietro
