My impression is that this entire process needs to follow more of a  
scientific ecosystem approach of combined theory and practice (or more  
accurately: hypothesis and experiment). Democracy theory seems to be  
ill-equipped to survive first contact with real-world politics.  
Thinking otherwise is implying that one can truly understand and  
predict human nature.

Although it is painful and sometimes discouraging, the most practical  
approach seems to be to come up with a hypothesis, build a system to  
test it, and then watch it fail (very likely), succeed (possible, I  
guess), or morph (quite possible). Then assess what happened and try  
again.

I haven't had time to investigate it yet, but isn't JeDEM a start?
