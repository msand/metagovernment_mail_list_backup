<PRE>Personal Democracy Forum report, EU edition.

I went to the Personal Democracy Forum, here are my impression for this group.

The two days were incredible, full of networking and ideas. In general
I would say that we are at least 10 years ahead of everybody there.
Most people there concentrate on trasparency, and open data. Some on
the digital divide. There is a lot of work and a lot of noise on
results we would consider trivial or at maximum irrelevant. For
example, politicians using facebook and twitter to reach more people.
Yes, that can be done, but it is just using facebook and twitter as a
1 to many system. Can't we do anything better?

Every now and then someone would get it. There were presentations were
a politician would express her frustration: I receive 100 emails a
day, how can I integrate them.

Some people did not realise that the problem, the key problem, is a
problem of integration. So we had the CEO of GetUp who would tell us
how he had millions of people signing his actions, and each sending
personal emails to their representatives. But there is a catch: the
emails are personal but the meaning of message is always about the
same. Then the representatives calling it Spam. I would give reasons
to the representatives, but of course the man in the street didn't.
Again the problem is a problem of integration of the multiple voices
and framing of this problem.

I would say that only a very very tiny minority had framed the problem
in the right context.

A politician from CDU (christian democrats in germany) described how
you have thousands of email protesting, but when the same people are
invited to participate in a constructive production of an alternative
the number drops to hundreds, and then the original ideas end up being
about 20-30. Those are good news, because 20-30 original ideas are
numbers that our systems can absolutely cope with.

Another person who really framed the work VERY well was Paul Johnston
that in the talk Opening Up Policy-Making to Public Participation,
gave us some really good insights about how we need to start maturing
up. How elected representatives just cannot cope with thousands of
unrelated emails, of how few of those emails actually have real
content. I hope I can find the video online. Those are people who are
pushing the group toward the direction we are interested in, having
citizen work inside the government.

Another interesting talk was about europetitions. Did you knew that
anyone can petition the EU parliament. Even more, it looks like it
does not even have to be a european to do it (wow).
There are two kind of petitions, petitions where you are suggesting a
law and I think that for this you need to be 1 million signatures from
the EU. But then there is also another form of petition. For example
if a local law does not follow EU standard you (anyone, any single
person) can send a petition. We were presented a website where people
can write a petition, and send it to the EU parliament. Also when the
parliament replies the reply is sent to all the participants. So I
dialogue between the EU parliament and the citizen is potentially
started. Although petitions have limited power I think this is really
cool. And I spoke with Reindr Rustma who was presenting this website.
They have an API, so it is possible to interface it from the outside,
so now I am considering organising a vilfredo plug in, so people can
write a petition together, and then send it with a click.

During the forum I also started a new question in Vilfredo and I
advertised at pdf on twitter, using the pdfeu tag. We are running the
question rapidly as we want to use the answer to post it to the
crossroad website.

ouff, the more I go on the more I feel I should be doing this full time...


Cheers,
Pietro
