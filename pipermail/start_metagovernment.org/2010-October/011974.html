<PRE>Sorry to sound like a broken record, but from my perspective, it would be
good to frame &quot;questions&quot; as objective (measureable) statements of
longer-term, more visionary goals and shorter-term, more readily achievable
objectives, i.e., what we aim to accomplish within the relatively near term
in support of the longer-term vision.

It also seems to me to be a good practice to indicate not only who will do
what (provide inputs and conduct processes) in pursuit of each objective but
also who the intended beneficiaries are ... and to ensure that feedback is
efficiently and effectively solicited from both of those groups of
stakeholders (particularly those whose inputs and actions may be required).

Lacking such a frame of reference, there is little wonder that so much
dialog is so unproductive, including, dare I suggest, the dialog on this
listserv.

I think this points toward a deeper issue in all our open-drafting  
systems (and in closed systems too). The way a question is presented  
greatly affects peoples answers. Further, in open drafting, there is  
the liklihood of many very similar proposals.

Given that, a question-framing process seems helpful if not downright  
necessary if we ever hope to scale to larger communities.

Of course, there's also the risk that locking-in to one question might  
hinder synthesis...
