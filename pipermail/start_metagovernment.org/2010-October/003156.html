<PRE>Hi Pietro,
No the winner was <A HREF="http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=PROJ_ICT&amp;ACTION=D&amp;DOC=1&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;QUERY=012b9a4656ee:1814:597dd8c9&amp;RCN=93838,">http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=PROJ_ICT&amp;ACTION=D&amp;DOC=1&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;QUERY=012b9a4656ee:1814:597dd8c9&amp;RCN=93838,</A> totally useless project.
I agree with you that the EU may not be ready yet for a change like the one proposed by EUGAGER and Vilfredo in particular.
Not sure how good it is to share all these ideas that came out from public collaboration with anyone that cannot guarantee the freedom it needs to work on large scale.
Ifyou do havemoreinfo on who they are and what they intend to do as an outcome of the project please let us know...

Cheers,
Giovani

&gt;<i> Back on the topic of the xroad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is where they called the question:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://crossroad.epu.ntua.gr/blog/2010/10/08/which-are-the-key-ict-research-challenges-for-governance-and-policy-making-have-your-say/">http://crossroad.epu.ntua.gr/blog/2010/10/08/which-are-the-key-ict-research-challenges-for-governance-and-policy-making-have-your-say/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> we posted out point at the additional challenge. I chose that because
</I>&gt;<i> I did not agree on their division of the problem in 4 areas.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are now at 36 points, and counting, and growing. The highest other
</I>&gt;<i> has 26 points that they painstakingly got in 2 weeks time. We reached
</I>&gt;<i> 36 points in 24 hours. We are really running the risk to win this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then what? Seriously, shall we discuss the possible after outcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I were in them I would invite the person (or the community) that
</I>&gt;<i> has suggested the challenge to come and explain better what did they
</I>&gt;<i> mean. After all those descriptions are really short. Will they do it?
</I>&gt;<i> If they do it, how can we make sure that we all participate in the
</I>&gt;<i> answer? Or shall one of us (which probably would be me, as the name on
</I>&gt;<i> the question is mine) go there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My claim is that we are much much in front of them. And we should show
</I>&gt;<i> it to them by showing that we are able to take collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> decisions, in little time. One week is enough for us. We have done it
</I>&gt;<i> this time, we can do it again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If instead I (or someone else) just goes there and gives a
</I>&gt;<i> presentation at least the presentation should be prepared together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure about this, but I think those are the people that wan
</I>&gt;<i> the EU fundings we applied for 2 years ago. When in the application,
</I>&gt;<i> as a side effect, we got Vilfredo started.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure they really will welcome our input. Nor do I think the
</I>&gt;<i> EU is so open to it either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are winning this battle, but let's think strategically, what are
</I>&gt;<i> the next step we should do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts?
