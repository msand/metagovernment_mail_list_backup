<PRE>So it looks like that our proposal is not just first among our forum
(where it si also the only), but also in the other forums. We have 27
votes, the highest so far in the other forums are 26!

<A HREF="http://crossroad.uservoice.com/forums/77255-additional-challenges">http://crossroad.uservoice.com/forums/77255-additional-challenges</A>

Still there are some days left to vote, so we might fall back. If
someone has not voted please do it.
This proposal represent what this community has developed. What most
of us are looking for.

Now on another topic, the question on the name of the kind of
democracy we are trying to reach has moved another generation. You
know, you have all received the emails.

I am here just to tell you about the key people.

In brief:
MichaelMaranda  ( 1653 1654 )
vilfredo  ( 1654 1656 )
battocchia  ( 1662 )

Which means:
I and Michael should work on
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1654">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1654</A>

Matias (happy birthday, by the way!!! )
should work on
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1662">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1662</A>

Michael should also work on
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1653">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1653</A>

And I should also work on:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1656">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1656</A>


But since I have already written my version of the 1654 here:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1661">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1661</A>

I don't think I shall do it again.
Maybe the system should have a way to store when someone is attempting
something, and not asking him to do that again.

Of course anyone can add any proposal they want.


Wow, first, that is really good. I now wonder if they will consider us
at all. I mean I can really imagine how they did not see this coming
and how it will really give a strong push in a direction they did not
consider. GOOD!

I am so tired of eGov conferences where all they talk is transparency,
using social netowrks to reach voters, and once considering good
receiving 3000 comments.


Cheers,
Pietro
