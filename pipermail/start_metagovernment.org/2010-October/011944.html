<PRE>Yes, I agree that before publishing the book (not sure we have finished the epilogue tough??) we should consider knowing more who we are talking to.

About the blog, yes that would be nice. I'd like to share more about that idea of distributed, p2p, social network infrastructure I proposed at La Sapienza University back when we were preparing EUGAGER, where there is no central datacenter holding all citizen's sensible data, but your data is hosted by yourself and partially by your contacts (people you told you trust). A few &quot;emergency servers&quot; would still be needed to hold data from contacts with little or none connections(ie new users, people less active, ecc...).

I think that is a crucial step towards guaranteeing citizens that their data won't be used to &quot;datamine&quot;, &quot;track&quot; and &quot;control&quot; political trends that can be used against democracy, and also that aggregate data won't be sold by a single private or public company.
Unfortunatelly that was not part of the EU call (infrastructure), but in the light of making it all open I think it is very important.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks Giovani,
</I>&gt;<i> I stand corrected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, we just reached 45 point, also I presume with your help. Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> (And thanks to everybody else who also voted).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One question:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not sure how good it is to share all these ideas that came out from public collaboration with anyone that cannot guarantee the freedom it needs to work on large scale.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Weren't you suggesting that we publish the proposal as a book? Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> now it would be the right time to do it. But of course if you are
</I>&gt;<i> afraid that our ideas might be misused...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have recently (yesterday) started a blog on Vilfredo (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.vilfredo.org">http://blog.vilfredo.org</A> ). It is meant to be the blog where I
</I>&gt;<i> describe the philosophy behind vilfredo, why things are the way they
</I>&gt;<i> are, a review of the questions as they appear, and a review of the
</I>&gt;<i> eGov work I get in touch with. From time to time I will also like to
</I>&gt;<i> invite other people to write entries. Maybe you could write about
</I>&gt;<i> Eugager at some point :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ifyou do havemoreinfo on who they are and what they intend to do as an outcome of the project please let us know...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I surely would.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
