I hope to draw the line so that the architectural docs are purely
technical, in the sense of giving developers the minimal info they
need to code against, while the rest is factored out as theory.  So
the theory could get fairly specific.  At bottom it'll describe the
conceptual top of the architecture (if that makes sense).

I've appended an outline of planned research, below.

That's what I used to think, too.  Now I'd be happy to put on the
brakes till we have a language (better than politics) to discuss the
more controversial aspects.  The language can only come from theory, I
think.

It might be a good place to publish.  Here's another that has a longer
history in print: <A HREF="http://services.bepress.com/jpd/">http://services.bepress.com/jpd/</A>
No comprehensive theory has been published in either of those
journals.  Here's another one that looks interesting:
<A HREF="http://www.the-utopian.org/">http://www.the-utopian.org/</A>
I haven't read any of it, yet.

Here's an outline of the research project I'm planning:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Project Autonomy: speculations on a methodology of societal
  restructuring by communicative action
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Prolegomenon: the inevitable expectation of a utopian consensus

   I. A TECHNOLOGY OF LARGE-SCALE COMMUNICATIVE ACTION

    * Voting media in the service of large-scale
      communicative action

    * Drafting media in the service of large-scale
      communicative action

    * Discussion media in the service of large-scale
      communicative action

  II. THE INSTITUTION OF COMMUNICATIVE ACTION IN POLITICS

    * The structuring of power by communicative action

    * Rule making by communicative action

 III. THE MEANING OF MODERN CONSENSUS

    * The essential plurality in the modern construction of consensus

    * A ratchet to modernity's end: freely stepped consensus
      and the realization of autonomy

    * Consensual utopia as a societal religion

    * Soteriology of distant worlds: salvation in the speed of light
