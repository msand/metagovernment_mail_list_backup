<PRE>Hi Zury, as another outsider, I can't recommend this enough - just
stick your nose in and participate in any debate which captures your
interest.  I find this list to be very civil and respectful.  Now this
isn't meant to diminish what you say about semi-private dialog, but I
do think that will occur amongst a small group of core contributers,
regardless of the venue.

Personally, I'd like to see the migration from this list to be to a
permanent new home.  Online communities tend to fracture with each
move, and multiple moves can be fatal.

With regards the list you provided - I took a look at a few, but I
still don't know of any participation medium that can scale up as to
be sufficiently future-proof.  I mean yes - a platform that organises
content in different subjects and groups, allows for tagging and
&quot;liking&quot; and all that, would be an incremental step up from what we
have now.  Today.  But that wouldn't scale up to allow meaningful
individual participation for a majority of users, at the scale of a
city.

You may care about the environment, but you've got less motivation to
participate in a city-wide forum, when you're just going to get
ignored and your input lost in the noise.  But - for example - if the
system was able to recognise you as the environmental go-to-person
amongst a core group of your friends, then you've got some motivation
to specialise your knowledge.

This sort of scaling is a natural progression that we're starting to
see in social networks.  You are no longer connected with just your
friends, but you get to see content/comments from your
friends-of-friends.  AFAIK (I haven't logged on in ages) Facebook
isn't doing anything with foaf2 (friends-of-a-friend-of-a-friend) data
yet other than friend recommendations - I expect to see it become
widespread there first though.

But to take the example above - you'd now find yourself, as the
go-to-person for environmental issues, in a small core group comprised
of the environmentalists nominated by all the friends of your friends.
 And you could keep extending that further until you've covered the
entire city/country/solar system - the point being that there is a
core group, and associated status, available to you corresponding to
your level of participation.  This is an aside - but I think this
would be a great foundation for issue-based proxy-voting.

I expect we'll be seeing platforms integrate more foafx features
relatively soon, and I'd fully support a switch to a platform which
was scalable in that manner.

Also, more controversially - core groups are, I think, essential to
getting anything done in the absence of the collaborative
decision-making systems we hope to create.  Having just 100x the
number of active users on this mailing list would make it very hard
for an existing core group to communicate and maintain their
relationships which would affect their ability to achieve the same
goals.  I'm not talking about turning people away, but in my opinion
it's not altogether a bad thing (for now) that the active population
is self-regulating.

Richard
