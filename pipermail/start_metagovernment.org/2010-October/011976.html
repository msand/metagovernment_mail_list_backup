<PRE>I am sorry, my english seem to fail me in understanding much of the
last 4 messages (last edit: 6 messages).

I am not being ironic. It's just that I have a very practical mind,
and a lot of what is being said seem to be too general for me to get a
grip on it.

In particular:

</I>
Is this a rhetorical question? It seems to me that the more a person is
concentrated of having his voice heard, but not necessarily his
requirement met, the more we are inserting unnecessary blockage toward
finding a real consensus. It's a bit like asking for attention. Part
of the educated modus operandi that we need to develop to use
succesfully the system is to agree on good suggestion even when they
are not coming from you.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a problem of recursion here - if you can't find consensus

</I>&gt;<i> and perhaps the meta-meta-tenets, etc. &#160;But I wonder if Michael is an

</I>&gt;<i> join the consensus?
</I>
I cannot even parse this.

&gt;<i> Synthesis isn't all-or-nothing, but with a single
</I>&gt;<i> conceptual layer of choices, it feels that way.
</I>
Here is something I can answer. It is possible to consider multiple
voting, like rating the answers, or ordering them. But I have a
_strong_ intuition (funded on some partial math results) that the
result of this would be that the Pareto Front would grow a lot, even
to become the whole list of all the proposals. At the end an all or
nothing seem to be the most acceptable solution. You decide where the
threshold for something to be acceptable is. But you are invited to
put it as low as it is actually acceptable.

</I>
Oh boy, I am equally lost. Again is this a rhetorical question? (mine is not!)
My understanding is that we tried to answer the question posed. When
this did not work we moved into the meta level, and then we happen to
stumble upon an answer that was acceptable by all. We should all just
vote for ALL the proposals that were acceptable, regardless if they
were proposals, meta proposals, and so on. If you have followed this
principle in this question, on this generation, we would have had a
consensus. Instead by only voting your own proposals, even though we
had other proposals that were acceptable we went near the consensus
without the algorithm finding it.

Please understand, I am not finger pointing at you, we are all
learning to use this tool together. Maybe the tool should list the
people who voted only for their own proposal, or only for one
proposal.

&gt;<i>&#160;We don't need full consensus on the wording/semantics there.
</I>
I can't parse this too.

&gt;<i> So, any of our higher level input doesn't necessarily stick to the output in
</I>&gt;<i> the way we'd like unless we all have shared commitment to it doing so. &#160;(And
</I>&gt;<i> it seems to me we do -- which is why are here after all)

Uhm?

Agreed!

&gt;<i> Given that, a question-framing process seems helpful if not downright

Sorry, what does question framing mean? Do you mean collaboratively
writing/editing the question?

What does locking-in mean?

This is a 52 pages document, can you give us a summary?

&gt;<i> This is an answer to the old adage &quot;the system that created the problem
</I>&gt;<i> cannot solve the problem&quot; or however it goes. &#160;This idea is that the
</I>&gt;<i> quesiton need to match the perceived conditions, and the response needs be
</I>&gt;<i> at least as complex as the question. &#160;Elsewise, repeat.
</I>
Sorry, this is incorrect. For example in Science you have very simple
questions (how did life arise on earth?), with very complex answers,
and very complex questions with very simple answers (take any long
equation whose answer is 2). Something that is important is that there
is no &quot;conservation of complexity&quot; principle in Nature; complex causes
can have simple effects and simple causes can have complex outcomes.
That's why it's so interesting.

&gt;<i> Mind you, I am not a fan of consensus, except at &quot;same stage complexity.&quot;
</I>
Uhm? Define same stage complexity, given what said above.

</I>
The idea of Vilfredo is to build a general tool to answer open
question within a community. Not al communities (or all questions)
have objective measurable goals. But surely when they can be defined
it would be helpful if they are used. How would you suggest? For
example how would you have rephrased this question in a way that fit
your requirements?

I don't think Vilfredo can have a system to satisfy those
requirements, but there might be some guidelines on how to write a
succesful question, and yours principles might very well fit there.

So you are suggesting a system where people can change a question
while the question is running?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would also argue that such a system would provide better results.

This seem to be a risk

So you understand what Ed what saying! Aargh, is it only me then?


Sorry to be so pedantic, but I am really at a loss.
