<PRE>Hello,
the question on the ICT reached the third generation, and since the
aim was to produce a proposal to present at the xroad website I
decided to take the proposal more highly rated and present it over
there.

Now the proposal is available here:
<A HREF="http://crossroad.uservoice.com/forums/77255-additional-challenges/suggestions/1123307-given-an-open-question-find-an-algorithm-that-let-">http://crossroad.uservoice.com/forums/77255-additional-challenges/suggestions/1123307-given-an-open-question-find-an-algorithm-that-let-</A>

At the moment it only have my 3 votes. Please vote for it. Each person
can put a maximum of 3 votes, and has 10 available. The best proposal
we are competing with has 18 votes. That is 6 people. If each of the
person that participated in the question were to vote we would get 30
points.

Why is this important? The xroad group are a university group that is
researching on behalf of the EU what research should be funded. So the
result of this procedure could very well be that the EU starts making
research in the direction we are interested in. The one of real
democratic procedure.

SO your vote is important. And it would give a sense to all the work
we have done on VgtA those days.

I would have also added the other proposal that made it to the pareto front:
&quot;Allowing agents to contribute their entire perspective, not forcing
them to 'pick a side'. Most people can see arguments for and against
contradictory positions, and this valuable data should not be lost.&quot;

but somehow it seems to be a piece of a bigger answer. And it is
included in the other. But if someone frames it, for example just by
saying: producing a system such that...
then I will be happy to add my 3 points to that as well. I have voted
it on Vilfredo too.

Cheers,
Pietro
