<PRE>Hi Florin,

Thanks for pointing this out.  It looks like they're aiming at an
Android-specific version of what we've been calling &quot;cross-forum
theatre&quot;.  As we've envisioned it, the app would be a top-level UI
bringing together the separate e-dem tools/media (like voting,
drafting and discussion) and loosely integrating them under a single
marquee.  It looks like their app could eventually land in that same
neighbourhood.

I can't try it (no android yet).  The changelog shows that they're
rapidly prototyping, and the users are responding well.  I doubt they
have adequate tools/media under the hood, though, to build any kind of
actionable consensus.  So (like you suggest) we we could maybe help
with that.  There's a potential for collaboration in which they
develop the top-level UI, and we continue to develop all the rest.

But I'm beginning to doubt that any kind of collaborative e-dem is
workable at this stage.  I'm beginning to think that the priorities
instead ought to be:

  1. Research the theory.  Write it up for publication in journals.
     Open a dialogue with academics and other theorists.

  2. Document the architecture.

  3. Prototype the top-level UI (cross-forum theatre or whatever).
     Work with the core users and refine/grow the whole thing.

Because we can't collaborate technically without a documented
architecture, and we can't document the architecture without a theory
that provides reasonable answers to the following questions:

  1. a) What is the purpose of the architecture?

     b) How does it fit in society?

     c) How does the design contribute to the purpose/fit?

I don't think this is just a technical requirement, either.  I think
we also need these answers (esp. a and b) to support *any* kind of
rational discussion about e-dem, whether it's technical or not.  I'm
reluctant these days to even talk about e-dem, because the discussion
usually devolves into an emotionally-charged polemic or ideological
debate (on all sides, I guess).  So I end up contributing to something
that pushes people further apart rather than bringing them closer
together.

If this makes sense, then it might follow that we don't *want* to
deliver a useable, popular app (3) yet.  It might not help matters and
it might make them worse.  Instead, we should focus on the theory (1)
and architectural docs (2).  (Or am I misjudging the situation?)
