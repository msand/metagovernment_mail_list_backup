Yes, although I would say they're more than sketches (about 85-90%
ready-to-code).  But your strategy is also a valid one--sometimes it
brings the collective consciousness &quot;in alignment&quot; faster to use
standard channels like a published paper.  The problem is that writing
it out with sufficient rigor in a research paper is *itself* coding
it, and the time and energy seems much better spend just *doing* it.
So I make it open source and any one is invited to participate in
making taking the theory and putting it into practice.  That way
there's really no room for any group to complain or feel shortchanged.

The battle at times for me is how much to make public so that the
timing of roll-out can be sufficient aligned with the overall vision
rather than being usurped by corporate (or other interests) whose
visions really aren't in harmony with the project.  It would be tragic
to see great ideas and spirit taken again into walled gardens of
corporate domains and the overall vision starved due to
attention-deprivation.  In this regard, the lessons of the first
internet wave (and crash) are duly noted.

Anyway, you can check the &quot;current events&quot; page for what the next
coding steps are and I can tell you the algorithms over jabber or
such....

Take care,

Mark
