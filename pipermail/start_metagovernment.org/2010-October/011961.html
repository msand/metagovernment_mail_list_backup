<PRE>Hi Paul,
I like the idea that there should be a way for people to discuss a
question before it starts. Or maybe comment it until the first person
writes the first possible answer. But then as soon as the first
possible answer is written we probably should go on and accept it.
Like those websites where you can re edit a comment as long as no one
has commented on it. Then it is frozen.

Somehow this would be a discussion ABOUT the question. A meta
discussion. Suggesting ways to rephrame it. Or to reword it. A meta
discussion.

On the other hand I resist the idea of a discussion board to discuss
the proposals themselves. I know there is an opportunity to do this
thing right by integrating the board with Vilfredo. But anything else
will water down the decision power of V. Think of it like this: I want
that when people hit the &quot;move on&quot; button, they really don't know what
the result will be. But then when looking at all the calculations it
becomes obvious why that answer has won, and not another. Right now we
are in that situation, but if people discuss outside, then they will
reach an agreement outside, then one will take the responsibility to
&quot;write up for Vilfredo&quot; the answer. Then vilfredo will become just
another useless piece of bureaucracy; no, it has to be done right.
This will not exclude the possibility to comment on proposals, ....
The question we need to answer will be: who can comment, what comments
can be done? who can see the comments? Who can reply to the
comments... I am still thinking.

Remember that, for example, people cannot read proposals while other
people are writing them. And this is REALLY important, for reasons of
fairness and to let creativity come out. When people read proposals
they tend to think along those lines. Instead knowing that people have
genuinely come out with the same idea is also very good.

But all this makes it unfeasible to comment while you are writing.

Then you don't want people to comment while they are voting. People
should be allowed to vote without having other people affecting their
opinion with their comments. In Italy we have 24 hours before the
voting where the media are not allowed to speak about the election, to
let people a good reflection time.

So maybe the only place where people should be allowed to comment
should be After the voting stage. In a stage between the voting and
the writing. And maybe only on the posts of the Pareto Front (the
others have been excluded, it is better not to put them back in the
memory of the people like asking them not to think of an elephant).

But we don't want either to add a whole phase. Each phase forces
people to come to thte site one extra time for each generation. That
is a huge cost. At least for now we should avoid it. So if we don't
add a whole new phase, then this have to be during the writing phase,
thus it will have to follow the rules of the writing phase, which is:
no peeking on what others are writing. So also on peeking on others
comments.

Now this might be very interesting, because then we could have a
writing phase where people are also allowed to comment on the Pareto
Front proposals. And the comments might come out just during the
voting phase. So they will have their maximum effect. It is not bad!

Imagine the comment:
&quot;I haven't voted and never will vote for this because ...&quot;

Also what comments can people write? I mean of course we want the free
form, but what about structured comments, like: this proposal is
equivalent to this other one, then there are all sort of math tricks
that Vilfredo can (and should) do. Like suggesting one proposal to
whoever votes for the other one. And so on...


I know this is not what you are thinking of... bear with me :-)

Cheers,
Pietro

&gt;<i> Hi Pietro,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the problems with trying to write the perfect question are one of
</I>&gt;<i> the reasons we need a discussion facility, in Vilfredo or in any other
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making process. And a proposal editing facility too. We need all
</I>&gt;<i> three elements running alongside one another: discussion, proposal writing
</I>&gt;<i> and editing, and voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because the person writing the question is always going to have some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> presupposition - about what the question is about, or about the facts
</I>&gt;<i> relevant to the question, for example. So these can be pointed out in
</I>&gt;<i> comments, the question can be tweeked by other users, expanded into a bigger
</I>&gt;<i> question or split up into smaller ones, so that the users can see if they
</I>&gt;<i> agree on the relevant facts etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then we can move into the voting stage, keeping the commenting and editing
</I>&gt;<i> process running at the same time so that people can say something like &quot;Hey,
</I>&gt;<i> this is a really popular proposal but it doesn't resolve the issue we
</I>&gt;<i> proposed&quot;, and then modify the proposal or open up a new question which is
</I>&gt;<i> better defined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's true that people can influence the issue dramatically through the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion. I think that's good, as long as all the useful comments have a
</I>&gt;<i> chance to be heard. Any apparent consensus in the discussion still has to go
</I>&gt;<i> through the proof of the vote: perhaps there are silent dissenters out
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Paul,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You know what would be needed? A manual on how to write a question for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We know it has to be an open question, but it's more than that. Some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questions are only apparently open, and we had an example with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> question on the name that we discussed before. If a question has many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternatives, but a finite number, it will not permit itself to let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people find a real compromise, then the system should find all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible alternative and then go with a Condorcet voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But then there are other situations where questions are not really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effective...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for example when the question is not well specified, or there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presupposition from the person who writes the question.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Someone who has the time should look into the history of the questions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and come up with examples.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also another example of something that at present does not work well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Everybody here is telling how there should be a discussion board along
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side with the decision board. Well, a friend has decided to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vilfredo for a decision in a group. But first he implemented a mailing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list. People are so successfully deciding in the mailing list that I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am doubting Vilfredo will ever be useful there. Now you might think,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well who cares, if the mailing list is letting them decide, what use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do we have of Vilfredo. But the problem is that Vilfredo is set up to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be fair, giving to each person equal weight by the voting system. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the mailing list people have an influence that is in general directly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proportional to the work they are willing to do and how much do they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speak. SO people who silently dissent have a weight on vilfredo but no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weight on a mailing list. Something that is making me wonder...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 1) To explain what is quite a complicated idea in bite-sized chunks,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;What does the name Metagovernment mean?&quot;, &quot;What is meant by radical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; transparency?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 2) To anticipate and counter some of the preconceptions people have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; what Metagovernment is and how it would (not) work, e.g. &quot;Won't people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; influenced to vote a certain way by the media?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 3) To present questions which have more than one competing answer, e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; anonymous interactions have a place within the metagovernment?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 4) To imagine parts of the project which have not been implemented, e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;How will discussion take place?&quot; (This question is currently being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; discussed in Vilfredo - hopefully we'll reach an answer which can be
