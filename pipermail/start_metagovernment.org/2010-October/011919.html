<PRE>Movement Camp kicks off Sunday.  It's an online event - a confluence of Camp
traditions from RecentChanges to  Transparency to Participation to
Collaboration to Open Sustainability and more...

The MG community and it's concerns are more than welcome -- the insights and
tools under development in this community will certainly inform the
conversation and the work

Here's the announcement I posted the other day on OK/OSN lists, sessions,
pre-recordings still welcome!



So, a less than week away is Movement Camp -- we're taking the Coalition of
the
Willing's film as a starting point for a conversation on the sort of
information-action ecology we want, and how to get there.
<A HREF="http://www.coalitionblog.org/2010/09/coalition-movement-camp-1010-10-work-party/">http://www.coalitionblog.org/2010/09/coalition-movement-camp-1010-10-work-party/</A>


The Coalition's film and blog address the Climate Action community,
however the film spoke to me as someone more generally concerned for
the information-action ecology needed by the social benefit sector
broadly speaking (and for humanity's higher purposes if I want to wax
philosophic).

The event is online -- all are welcome. And all are invited to
participate -- pre-recorded video content - self-introductions,
statements, questions - are welcome. We also welcome suggested topics
and invite folks to step up to facilitate a session.

We will have some live-video content, some pre-recorded, and lots of
chat and discussion.

I'm camped in #movementcamp on freenode irc.

We'll be using MovementCamp.org as a staging ground for the
conversation.

Watch the film if you haven't -- it's only 15 minutes long and tells a
good story.

Check out the blog - especially our statement on Open Stewardship.
This statement is the fruit of many years effort on my part. I am
rather proud of it. The Coalition (and a few other groups) have
adopted it as a operating philosophy. (Something to live up to at any
rate.)   <A HREF="http://www.coalitionblog.org/2010/09/stewardship-and-open-culture/">http://www.coalitionblog.org/2010/09/stewardship-and-open-culture/</A>

I'll keep this short as I'm coming down with something and need to get
the word out to several other groups!

Respectfully,

Michael Maranda
