I find this interesting - and apologies if this is going off-topic, or
re-treading old ground - but is there anything to be gained by
attempting consensus at the tenet/criteria level?  As in - if you can
agree on criteria for a high-level &quot;direction&quot;, and grade the
low-level &quot;detail&quot; options against those - how many people would then
find it easier to compromise on the &quot;details&quot; knowing that their
&quot;direction&quot; was taken into consideration?

There is a problem of recursion here - if you can't find consensus
with the tenets, then you'd need to first work out the meta-tenets,
and perhaps the meta-meta-tenets, etc.  But I wonder if Michael is an
exception here, or if simply the knowledge that your higher-level
input is embedded into the details of a final decision you wouldn't
otherwise support, would enable more people to act the same way and
join the consensus?  Synthesis isn't all-or-nothing, but with a single
conceptual layer of choices, it feels that way.
