<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for the feedback. There's some useful ideas in that Vilfredo
discussion. In fact, the &quot;work between the mailing list and the Wiki&quot;
section covers exactly one of the isues I described. Is there a way to sign
up to receive an email for all new questions opened on Vilfredo, or do I
have to keep checking back on the site to remain up to date?

This &quot;Map&quot; section of metagovernment.org is also something I had never come
across (I've always just buzzed here and there with hyperlinks...) and it
goes some way to resolving the navigation problem that I would like to
tackle. The Map basically covers the &quot;What is (xyz)?&quot; questions that I would
include in an FAQ by linking to the relevant pages.

So I think I'll start by writing up some questions and answers that are not
covered by the Map section, and also updating some wiki pages to reflect the
current state of the debate on this list. Then we can think about whether to
keep the Map as well as an FAQ, or to integrate them into a single
navigation page. Whatever solution we decide on, we'll encourage visitors to
the front page to use this as a guide to the site.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I really like the idea, Paul.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An early and limited version of this existed before the site went wiki
</I>&gt;<i> (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before several philosophical transformations). That page got transcribed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into the wiki but sorely needs updating and expansion (it also has no
</I>&gt;<i> links
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to it). But you may find it a useful starting point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm writing from my phone so linking is difficult, but just look for: FAQ
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also look at the page entitled &quot;map&quot; which is a links-only version of
</I>&gt;<i> such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guide. I agree that q&amp;a would be more effective for people who don't want
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; read all that.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been thinking about what I and others who are not directly involved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with development of software can do to help advance the Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project. One idea I have returned to is a Q&amp;A section for the website
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyone could edit. I see this as serving several important purposes:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) To explain what is quite a complicated idea in bite-sized chunks, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;What does the name Metagovernment mean?&quot;, &quot;What is meant by radical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transparency?&quot; etc. The vast majority of this information is already on
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; site, but this way of organising it may help to a) guide first-time
</I>&gt;<i> visitors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through the concept in steps, and b) help people to find specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information they are looking for. It is no accident that corporations
</I>&gt;<i> love
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use Q&amp;A sections to explain tricky issues. I once translated one aimed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specifically at a large number of people who were about to be made
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; redundant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) To anticipate and counter some of the preconceptions people have about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what Metagovernment is and how it would (not) work, e.g. &quot;Won't people be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; influenced to vote a certain way by the media?&quot;, &quot;How can one be sure
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the system is safe from hackers?&quot;, &quot;Who will have the power to make sure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that decisions are implemented in the real world?&quot;, &quot;Won't there be a
</I>&gt;<i> bias
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; towards the views of people who spend all their time on the internet?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These two points both go back to the discussion we had about the front
</I>&gt;<i> page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the site and people's immediate reactions to the idea. The next two
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about how it might help us - people who are already participating in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) To present questions which have more than one competing answer. One
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem with the mailing list is that a certain issue will be discussed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then fall by the wayside as we move on to something else. A Q&amp;A could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide us with a prominent place for issues under discussion. e.g. &quot;Do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anonymous interactions have a place within the metagovernment?&quot; I
</I>&gt;<i> actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; found this question on the page entitled &quot;Anonymous interactions within
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; metagovernment&quot;, but I don't think I would have come across this page at
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without searching for the term &quot;anonymity&quot;. If such questions had greater
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; visibility on the site then multiple positions on the issue could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; displayed and updated to reflect the current state of the debate, and we
</I>&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spark some new ideas in the process.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) To imagine parts of the project which have not been implemented, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;How will discussion take place?&quot; Pietro recently said about how a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussion forum might be implemented in Vilfredo: &quot;I don't want to code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something wrong, because once it is coded it will take longer to pull it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; off.&quot; So let's have a place where we - both project developers and those
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the sidelines - can gather and refine our ideas about how things should
</I>&gt;<i> look
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when they are coded. This would be a resource which different projects
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; draw upon, so that hopefullly various concepts will be tried out and we
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see what works well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So my questions at this point are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Do you think a Q&amp;A section would serve these purposes?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Would it be easy enough to integrate into the site from a technical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standpoint?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Or is there a better way of addressing the issues I have described
</I>&gt;<i> above?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Paul
