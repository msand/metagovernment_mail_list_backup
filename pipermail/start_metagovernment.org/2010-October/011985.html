<PRE>Hi Zury, welcome to the list.

I think most of us are aware of the difficulties in using the mailing
list. The wiki was develped just to smooth out those difficulties. But
all in all the question remains, what CMS should metagovernment use.

We have an open question that was raised some time ago. The question
is now a bit old, but it's still valid. Why don't you go there and
write your proposal. If we all find an agreement (probably after a
couple of generations) we could then implement what we all agree on.

The question is at:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment</A>


I understand that it might seem that I am responding to your critic
about our disucssion being private by refering to some older
discussion, but really you just need to read the question, login and
add your proposal. There is really not much need to learn much more.
And then we can all solve this problem.

Welcome again, and thanks for your input!

Pietro

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been subscribe to Metagovernment Start mailing list for a while but I find it impossible to enter your long ago started semi-private dialogue the way it is now. I would imagine this happens to many others.
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to grow the debate, I think its time to change the platform to one that organizes it in subjects and groups, makes it easy to understand where the current discussion is comming from, allows for statistics about ther community and each members profile, uploading and linking to external documents, among many other benefits.
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a list of 9 free solutions and 7 free open-source projects for that goal:
