<PRE>Hi Pietro,

I think the problems with trying to write the perfect question are one of
the reasons we need a discussion facility, in Vilfredo or in any other
decision-making process. And a proposal editing facility too. We need all
three elements running alongside one another: discussion, proposal writing
and editing, and voting.

Because the person writing the question is always going to have some kind of
presupposition - about what the question is about, or about the facts
relevant to the question, for example. So these can be pointed out in
comments, the question can be tweeked by other users, expanded into a bigger
question or split up into smaller ones, so that the users can see if they
agree on the relevant facts etc.

Then we can move into the voting stage, keeping the commenting and editing
process running at the same time so that people can say something like &quot;Hey,
this is a really popular proposal but it doesn't resolve the issue we
proposed&quot;, and then modify the proposal or open up a new question which is
better defined.

It's true that people can influence the issue dramatically through the
discussion. I think that's good, as long as all the useful comments have a
chance to be heard. Any apparent consensus in the discussion still has to go
through the proof of the vote: perhaps there are silent dissenters out
there.

Cheers,
Paul

&gt;<i> Hi Paul,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You know what would be needed? A manual on how to write a question for
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We know it has to be an open question, but it's more than that. Some
</I>&gt;<i> questions are only apparently open, and we had an example with the
</I>&gt;<i> question on the name that we discussed before. If a question has many
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives, but a finite number, it will not permit itself to let
</I>&gt;<i> people find a real compromise, then the system should find all the
</I>&gt;<i> possible alternative and then go with a Condorcet voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then there are other situations where questions are not really
</I>&gt;<i> effective...
</I>&gt;<i> for example when the question is not well specified, or there are
</I>&gt;<i> presupposition from the person who writes the question.
</I>&gt;<i> Someone who has the time should look into the history of the questions
</I>&gt;<i> and come up with examples.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also another example of something that at present does not work well.
</I>&gt;<i> Everybody here is telling how there should be a discussion board along
</I>&gt;<i> side with the decision board. Well, a friend has decided to use
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo for a decision in a group. But first he implemented a mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list. People are so successfully deciding in the mailing list that I
</I>&gt;<i> am doubting Vilfredo will ever be useful there. Now you might think,
</I>&gt;<i> well who cares, if the mailing list is letting them decide, what use
</I>&gt;<i> do we have of Vilfredo. But the problem is that Vilfredo is set up to
</I>&gt;<i> be fair, giving to each person equal weight by the voting system. In
</I>&gt;<i> the mailing list people have an influence that is in general directly
</I>&gt;<i> proportional to the work they are willing to do and how much do they
</I>&gt;<i> speak. SO people who silently dissent have a weight on vilfredo but no
</I>&gt;<i> weight on a mailing list. Something that is making me wonder...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like to invite you to help refine the answers - often I'm
</I>&gt;<i> paraphrasing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from conversations on this list and sometimes I'm writing from my own
</I>&gt;<i> ideas,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I'm sure there's room for improvement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please also post new questions and/or answers, bearing in mind the aims
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the FAQ page which I outlined earlier:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) To explain what is quite a complicated idea in bite-sized chunks, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;What does the name Metagovernment mean?&quot;, &quot;What is meant by radical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transparency?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) To anticipate and counter some of the preconceptions people have about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what Metagovernment is and how it would (not) work, e.g. &quot;Won't people be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; influenced to vote a certain way by the media?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) To present questions which have more than one competing answer, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anonymous interactions have a place within the metagovernment?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) To imagine parts of the project which have not been implemented, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;How will discussion take place?&quot; (This question is currently being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussed in Vilfredo - hopefully we'll reach an answer which can be
</I>&gt;<i> posted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the Metagovernement FAQ)
