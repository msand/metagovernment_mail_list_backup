So in Vilfredo, I think this would involve a third stage to each  
round. Or at least a meta-round that interjects into the process after  
every few rounds of back-and-forth.

In DemocracyLab, this is already well incorporated into the process by  
the careful investigation of each individual's and issue's component  
parts.

Can other projects see the value and practicality of integrating in a  
meta-process of re-evaluating questions as they are debated?

That makes a lot of sense, particularly in this context. I would think  
it would vary depending on each project's approach. Again, I think  
DemocracyLab already does this fairly well to some extent, while other  
projects do not seem to do it much at all.
