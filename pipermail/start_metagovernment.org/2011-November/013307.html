<PRE>Hi All,
OK...I'm not a developer. I probably shouldn't even be on this list....but I have thought a lot about the scalability of collaborative systems. It seems to me that the issue of trust enters the picture only when you are trying to ascribe *votes* to *individuals...or groups* who cast them towards the development of some kind of *legislation...or representation*. I see the validity of the effort given that our current systems operate this way. Though it seems to me the real potential of the systems you all are developing is in a more informal and creative approach to building a DIFFERENT world. I imagine this must sound vague, simplistic and idealistic (because it is)....but please let me explain. 
In my mind what is currently taking place around the world is the emergence of a new ordering of our social or cultural infrastructure. It's bigger than any existing system of control or governance, transcends all boundaries, and has at it's core the ability to self-organize.  We-are-part-of-this and can influence it greatly (I believe)...but only by moving away from the older structures of polarity and separation, (us and them, right and left, mine and yours).

If (or when) we begin moving like starlings, in *murmuration* with each other (I love that word), the issue of trust shifts to the whole, and scalability can then be an organic ordering or grouping driven by intuition and attraction. Deliberation is minimal....orientation is holistic....beauty and celebration are always immanent.

I think developing tools for eDemocracy maybe putting new wine into old skins.....a very worthy effort, but I question if that is where we are really headed. As a self-aware, self-organizing emerging consciousness, I believe *we* are becoming less about ordering the polarity, than about trusting (and perhaps, to some degree, leveraging) the chaos. 

The question for me is what is the minimal structure/process necessary to *seed* an emerging global organism of creative, self-organizing evolution......online.

OK....I've probably just shat all over myself. You've probably already been down (or avoided) this road many times. I love what you all are doing. I wish I was a geek like you so I could join in all the fun.

Thanks so much for your efforts...
Steve

&gt;<i> Hi Thomas,
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for hearing the talk, thanks for taking the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me see if I can answer your question.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed Scalability is the key problem, and a lot of this will only be
</I>&gt;<i> solved when we start with some example. For example, the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> clustering proposal, is really nice, but the clusters will probably
</I>&gt;<i> not be all of the same size. With all sort of problems regarding the
</I>&gt;<i> too small clusters and the too big ones. Still they can be solved. But
</I>&gt;<i> probably we will not ba able to apply the same solution everywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed if the solution was about a single number I would NOT call this
</I>&gt;<i> an open question, but something between an open and a closed question.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But the fact is that even when you are deciding questions that have to
</I>&gt;<i> do with a number, it is possible that more complex solution come out.
</I>&gt;<i> This has happened in Vilfredo, where the community has come out with a
</I>&gt;<i> solution that was obviously not considered by the person asking the
</I>&gt;<i> question.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And then there is another issue, even questions that are &quot;only a
</I>&gt;<i> number&quot; often hide the complexity inside. For example some people
</I>&gt;<i> might be willing to pay a certain tax rate, if then the services they
</I>&gt;<i> receive are of a certain kind. In Italy many people protest for higher
</I>&gt;<i> taxes, but they often claim, the problem is to pay so high taxes and
</I>&gt;<i> then receive such little services from the government. The recent
</I>&gt;<i> prime minister, Monti, explained that we will now have to make some
</I>&gt;<i> sacrifices, but it will be presented in packages that touch everybody,
</I>&gt;<i> so no one will feel an economic maneuver is just against them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the idea of using a Votorola like system, that is a proxy
</I>&gt;<i> voting, I think this is not really acceptable.
</I>&gt;<i> First of all a problem with proxy voting is that people give support
</I>&gt;<i> to someone, then they forget, and that person remains with an
</I>&gt;<i> inherited power. This is very dangerous. Look how now in
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment you have 5 votes that you can move as you want. Yes,
</I>&gt;<i> people can take them away from you, but some of those people are not
</I>&gt;<i> active anymore, and many simply do not care. They will vote for
</I>&gt;<i> someone because they trust him. Because he is a cool guy, or because
</I>&gt;<i> he is an actor. Sorry, I do not think this is ok.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also an important principle that I am following is a principle of Fair
</I>&gt;<i> participation, which require that proposals are all evaluated only by
</I>&gt;<i> the content. This means that people enter this system without knowing
</I>&gt;<i> who else is there. They do not know the others. They can be their best
</I>&gt;<i> friends or their worse enemies. They only read what those people
</I>&gt;<i> propose, or comment. If you take away this principle you are inserting
</I>&gt;<i> in the system all sort of social dynamic that da facto make it harder
</I>&gt;<i> for people to evaluate things because of their content.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed every voter has the right to participate to both a clarity
</I>&gt;<i> working group and a compromise working group. But, as you pointed out,
</I>&gt;<i> it is probably unfeasible if the groups are too big, in which case
</I>&gt;<i> some groups can be split, and have two groups work in parallel on the
</I>&gt;<i> same cluster.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also remember that work groups usually require extra effort.
</I>&gt;<i> Although everybody is welcome to participate, on average less than
</I>&gt;<i> everybody will participate in the workgroups.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have you seen the two taks I gave on Fair Participation and on  System
</I>&gt;<i> Generated Requests for Rewriting Proposals
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Ty-E9xlDA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Ty-E9xlDA</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first will clarify better the concept of fair participation (I am
</I>&gt;<i> now preparing another presentation on this),
</I>&gt;<i> and the second on the actual procedure to evaluate proposals. If this
</I>&gt;<i> system is utilized we could even have a system that invites people to
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite proposals based on how well are they able to explain a
</I>&gt;<i> position..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. you mention the system of groups within groups that is present in
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola. I am not sure I believe that will actually work. I mean, yes
</I>&gt;<i> you can have a fractal system o split groups, into smaller and smaller
</I>&gt;<i> units. But then I am not sure you can so easily come back and
</I>&gt;<i> aggregate proposals in the bigger groups. There is something about the
</I>&gt;<i> whole process that leave me uneasy. Not in the way people divide into
</I>&gt;<i> groups, but in the way arguments should then merge together. Sorry if
</I>&gt;<i> I can't be more specific.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello Pietro,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After watching your video: I like, that you adress the problem of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scalability. IMO this is *THE* problem of e-democracy. And as you know, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political science it is the main argument for representative democracy and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against direct democracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And as you point out, the solution has to be some sort of distillation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process where huge amounts of proposals get fused into a few.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pleasse correct me, if I'm wrong with the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You suggest a four-stage-process: 1. many single proposals --&gt; 2. a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clusters of proposals --&gt; 3. a few proposals --&gt; 4. very few final proposals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From 1. to 2. this is done by some math-algorithm. I suspect, this has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> immanent limitations. E.g. if the proposals only differ in a single number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (lets say a proposed tax-rate). If you have every number between 0 and 50,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how can you cluster them? Why not let the voters themselves decide to come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together and form clusters ... like in Votorola?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From 2. to 3. (minute 17.00 in the youtube-video) this is done by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clarity working groups. Has every voter the right to be in one of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> groups? For reasons of fairness, I guess yes. And the same from 3. to 4.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everybody should be allowed to be in one of the integration working groups.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But then the question comes up: how can thousands of voters in such a group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come up with a consensus? I mean, this is the question we were all up to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer in the first place. ... In Votorola the clustering can happen in as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many levels of depth as necesarry. This way all of the voters end up in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> self-chosen small groups of 5 to 15 members. A size, where people can still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talk to each other and also listen. I guess more than 20 is to many.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
