I meant to say that it *ought* to be like this, if it is done right.

</I>&gt;<i> there are many needs human beings have that they would not feel
</I>&gt;<i> confortable discussing in public.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have you read the book &quot;non violent communication&quot;? It was written
</I>&gt;<i> by Marshall Rosenberg, a student of Gandhi who structures
</I>&gt;<i> communication in 4 elements: facts, needs, emotion and
</I>&gt;<i> request. Maybe we need to develop something similar.
</I>
I haven't read Rosenberg, yet.  Thanks for suggesting him (I see the
similarity with Habermas's analysis).

The situation you describe above might be something that unorganized
and unassisted people could (for the most part) handle on their own.
We humans have the remarkable ability to inter-communicate and
negotiate almost any kind of mutual understanding or coordinated
action.  Students (like Rosenberg and Habermas) may analyze this and
struggle to understand how it all works, but whether we understand it
or not, it's something we all learn and do (like riding a bicycle).
(Theory is here struggling to catch up with a practice that's older
than humanity itself.)  Of course, we hope to scale this practice
structurally, and to functionally interconnect it with societal
systems, such as legislatures.  But what I want to suggest is that,
wherever these scaled up and formalized practices nevertheless enable
people to inter-communicate as they *ordinarily* would, nothing more
is required.  Those people will take it from there.

It's mostly where we fail in this crucial requirement (typically by
interfering too much with ordinary social interactions) that we need
help from theory.  I think we rarely need to ask, &quot;How can we help
people with these new tools and systems?&quot;  But rather, &quot;How can we
avoid messing them up?&quot;

I'm asking myself that after my experience in this OWS thread:
<A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/structure/forum/topic/what-about-the-people-who-dont-have-time-to-go-to-general-assemblies-enough/">http://www.nycga.net/groups/structure/forum/topic/what-about-the-people-who-dont-have-time-to-go-to-general-assemblies-enough/</A>

Thomas, are you following?  I think we need to automate draft creation
for new users, kind of like we did for remote drafts here in Metagov.
Maybe also automate registration in the pollwiki, making it part of
login to the vote-server.  These should be easy fixes.  Then I think
we can start to gain traction in these NYC forums.  If we do, we may
also gain leverage for some kind of cross-project vote mirroring.

</I>
Ah yes, it should be a filter...  I guess that's the best
architectural context for all such subjective properties
(attributions?) of a vote.

&gt;<i> &gt; ... by simply talking to the zombie voters.  They can ask, &quot;Do you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really want to continue voting for Mr. Superstar?  Don't you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; realize he's changed his position since you first supported him?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... Then they listen to the answers. ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, what if they don't answer?
</I>
Then we look around for signs of life. :-)  Seriously, online social
behaviour shouldn't differ *all that much* from offline.  If a person
is clearly at home (and in no distress), then we have an answer.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (1) I guess I disagree about strict objectivity. &#160;Habermas says the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subject and social worlds just as important to consensus making as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objective world. &#160;If we we de-personalize and de-socialize the medium
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by focusing exclusively on the content of the text, as Pietro
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggests, then we end up with a one-sided rationality. &#160;In consensus

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you are right when you say that only applying such principle

</I>&gt;<i> not sure this cannot be avoided by making a more round system. For
