<PRE>@ Pietro

&gt;<i> Regarding the idea of using a Votorola like system, that is a proxy
</I>&gt;<i> voting, I think this is not really acceptable.
</I>
In regard to the cluster-forming my suggestion was not to use proxy 
voting, but to simply let the users decide what cluster they want to 
belong to. Votorolas proxy-voting has this as a side-effect, but there 
might be other ways.

&gt;<i> First of all a problem with proxy voting is that people give support
</I>&gt;<i> to someone, then they forget, and that person remains with an
</I>&gt;<i> inherited power. This is very dangerous.
</I>
There are solutions for that. My favorite is from the german 
&quot;Liquid-Democracy-e.V.&quot;. They call it &quot;rusting of the votes&quot;, i.e. votes 
gradually melt away over time if they don't get refreshed by the voters.


&gt;<i> Also an important principle that I am following is a principle of Fair
</I>&gt;<i> participation, which require that proposals are all evaluated only by
</I>&gt;<i> the content. This means that people enter this system without knowing
</I>&gt;<i> who else is there. They do not know the others.
</I>
The issue of anonymity is not bound to proxy-voting, is it? The problems 
of anonymity and its possible solutions apply to all e-dem-systems, 
don't they?

&gt;<i> Indeed every voter has the right to participate to both a clarity
</I>&gt;<i> working group and a compromise working group. But, as you pointed out,
</I>&gt;<i> it is probably unfeasible if the groups are too big, in which case
</I>&gt;<i> some groups can be split, and have two groups work in parallel on the
</I>&gt;<i> same cluster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also remember that work groups usually require extra effort.
</I>&gt;<i> Although everybody is welcome to participate, on average less than
</I>&gt;<i> everybody will participate in the workgroups.
</I>
Ok, but since it is all about politics and sometimes about really 
important decisions you can still expect thousands of participants in a 
european-wide poll, can't you? Not to mention a global poll. And then 
the question comes up, which brought us all here in the first place: How 
can we technically support thousands of participants which try to reach 
a consensus on something? How can they all communicate with each other, 
bargain with each other, ... ? I feel this needs to be structured, since 
more than 20 people can not talk to each other directly.


&gt;<i> Have you seen the two taks I gave on Fair Participation and on  System
</I>&gt;<i> Generated Requests for Rewriting Proposals
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Ty-E9xlDA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Ty-E9xlDA</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c</A>
</I>
I saw the first. One thought of mine that I remember: I don't think it 
is technically possible to prevent someone pointing his friends to his 
proposal.

&gt;<i> you mention the system of groups within groups that is present in
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola. I am not sure I believe that will actually work. I mean, yes
</I>&gt;<i> you can have a fractal system of split groups, into smaller and smaller
</I>&gt;<i> units. But then I am not sure you can so easily come back and
</I>&gt;<i> aggregate proposals in the bigger groups.
</I>
Well, each group is represented by its candidate. Those candidates form 
another group which is represented by their candidate ...
So you are right, it won't be easy for a group of candidates to form a 
consensus, because they all have to get their voters to agree. But this 
is politics, isn't it? It's not easy, thats for sure.

Best Regards,
Thomas

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello Pietro,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After watching your video: I like, that you adress the problem of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scalability. IMO this is *THE* problem of e-democracy. And as you know, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political science it is the main argument for representative democracy and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against direct democracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And as you point out, the solution has to be some sort of distillation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process where huge amounts of proposals get fused into a few.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pleasse correct me, if I'm wrong with the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You suggest a four-stage-process: 1. many single proposals --&gt;  2. a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clusters of proposals --&gt;  3. a few proposals --&gt;  4. very few final proposals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  From 1. to 2. this is done by some math-algorithm. I suspect, this has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> immanent limitations. E.g. if the proposals only differ in a single number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (lets say a proposed tax-rate). If you have every number between 0 and 50,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how can you cluster them? Why not let the voters themselves decide to come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together and form clusters ... like in Votorola?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  From 2. to 3. (minute 17.00 in the youtube-video) this is done by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clarity working groups. Has every voter the right to be in one of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> groups? For reasons of fairness, I guess yes. And the same from 3. to 4.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everybody should be allowed to be in one of the integration working groups.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But then the question comes up: how can thousands of voters in such a group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come up with a consensus? I mean, this is the question we were all up to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer in the first place. ... In Votorola the clustering can happen in as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many levels of depth as necesarry. This way all of the voters end up in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> self-chosen small groups of 5 to 15 members. A size, where people can still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talk to each other and also listen. I guess more than 20 is to many.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thomas
