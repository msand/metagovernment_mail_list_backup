<PRE>&gt;<i> B. What about a mechanism, that will freeze one's voice with an

</I>&gt;<i> as soon as a proposal becomes &quot;active law&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> ...votes will stick with that &quot;active law&quot; as long as its active.

Ack.
&quot;Vote Rusting&quot; is the better concept :-)

@Anonymity
What about allowing people to vote anonymously, discuss anonymously,
propose anonymously, but once a proposal becomes &quot;active&quot;, the
identity of all voters will be revealed.
Would that help the &quot;Fair Participation Princple&quot; ?
...so after a proposal became active, everyone will be able to do
research if there are sock puppets.
...while its not active law, people might be anonymous or maybe they
even have to be anonymous.

I think it's a serious issue, that in fact, people often do not mainly
react based on arguments that were brought up, but by status and other
heuristics.
Normaly, if u tell someone something, it's not so important what you
say, but who you are. Reactions will be very different, depending on
who you are.

&gt;<i> @ Alex
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> my two points about anonymity and rusting of votes I made in my post before
</I>&gt;<i> apply here too, right?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well yes. Such a poll somehow simply dries out, it dies.
