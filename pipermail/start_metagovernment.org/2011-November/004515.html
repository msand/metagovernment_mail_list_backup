<PRE>Dear JF,

&gt;<i> The mission for Electronic Direct Democracy (E2D) International is
</I>&gt;<i> simply: to help establish, to support and promote, and to maintain
</I>&gt;<i> communication and co-operation between politically-neutral
</I>&gt;<i> electronic direct democracy parties around the world.
</I>
I imagine that two E2D parties might compete in the same election.
Would they also *cooperate* in that case?  Or would each strive to
dominate its rivals like ordinary parties do?

Network effects tend to reward big parties (and voting systems) at the
expense of smaller ones.  Unchecked by any opposing tendency, such as
the material interests that pull left and right, network effects will
always eliminate competition and lead to a monopoly.  A party might
even hope to establish a monopoly at the global level.  In any case,
what would prevent a one-party system from emerging in each country?
