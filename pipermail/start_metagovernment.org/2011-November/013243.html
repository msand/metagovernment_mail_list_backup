<PRE>Hello,

@ Ed:

In a previous post you mentioned the danger of an outside group taking 
over Metagov and its money just with the force of their masses of votes. 
If everybody was allowed to vote and a majority can decide ... there is 
the problem.

Conseo is working on a solution for that: To each vote the voter can 
connect the amount of resources he is willing to contribute. This could 
be Dollar, working hours, ... . So everybody can decide for himself 
where his money goes.

Here in the top left corner you can switch between votes and dollar in 
our prize-poll: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/y/vw/xf/#s=G!p!prz*b12&amp;c=DV">http://zelea.com/y/vw/xf/#s=G!p!prz*b12&amp;c=DV</A>

(the dollars seem to be just made up examples)

Thomas

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the legal governance, we need to choose a legal structure that allows:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    1. Full legal membership from individuals anywhere in the world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    2. Zero administrative cost for adding and deleting members
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       (including zero requirement for legal advice / costs). This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       would hinder extending membership to large numbers of people,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       and or members unwilling or unable to pay for full legal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       participation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    3. No a priori or adhoc structure to the membership (such as fixed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       number and classification of a board of directors). This would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       impose a top down power structure on the decision making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       process, and cause artificial separation between the general
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       membership and the decisions of the network.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    4. Full legal recognition of online voting, digital signatures,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       delegation and other means of voting where physical presence at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       meetings is not possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    5. Flexibility - the ability to change the structure of the legal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       structure through a vote of them members, suing the system of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       their preference (ie the software) at a time and in a manner of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       their choosing, without artificial restriction based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       regional law, or based on prohibitive cost (by requiring for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       instance legal advice to make such changes).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    6. The ability to create a wide range of charitable, ethical,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       not-for-profit organisational structures - without restricting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       these to preconceived ideas of what constitutes &quot;charitable&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       activity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    7. The ability to create nested and / or p2p organisational
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       (legal) structures. This allows the membership to structure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       legally binding decision making in a distributed, local, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       domain specific fashion, and not be forced into central and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       hierarchical structures.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Robust legal structures are possible, which allow the above. None of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them are perfect yet, but some of them are sufficiently simple and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flexible to allow us to create &quot;legal shells&quot; which embody our 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> principles. It does however rule out structures like Vereins, or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> classic charity structures, as the legal hub so to speak, all though 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these can be incorporated as member organisations with specific 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> national or anational roles. The overall legal architecture does not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to be complex, but should mirror / identify with the software 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think I am laying the groundwork for all of the above with the 
</I>&gt;<i> draft charter
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft1">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft1</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am keeping it deliberately extremely simple at first so we can build 
</I>&gt;<i> consensus around the basics. We can flesh out the details once we have 
</I>&gt;<i> passed that first step. Please feel free to edit as appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I still don't know is what existing legal structures we can look 
</I>&gt;<i> to to help us create a formally-recognized organization. You indicate 
</I>&gt;<i> that you are aware of some of these; can you please list some so I can 
</I>&gt;<i> research them? I will have limited availability for the next week, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I am very eager to explore this further to see if we can get this 
</I>&gt;<i> moving forward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Clearly it is important to embody the mission charter in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constitutional structure. However what is important is how it is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agreed / created and how it is changed. The &quot;change rules&quot; need to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> according to the principles of the LD software and not some rigid / 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> historically inherited / regional legal structure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The rules that my draft links to were developed by using Votorola to 
</I>&gt;<i> create a decision-making algorithm for editing our own wiki with 
</I>&gt;<i> consensus. I think it is a good starting point for the basis of the 
</I>&gt;<i> organization as a whole, no?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     P.S. Concerning version control for policy-making, you are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     echoing the concepts first proposed on this list by Aur Saraf,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     who started building such a system. You may want to look at some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     of his writings, starting with:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000187.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000187.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     He hasn't been active on the list since he got pulled into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     military, but I will cc him on this in case he's available to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     coordinate with you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes - that would be good. I read the above, and generally agree with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it. It's the implementation that counts I guess - has there been any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion of mobile and in particular mobile app creation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aur started developing the bare shell of the DVCS-based system, and 
</I>&gt;<i> then he got drafted. Nobody has picked up his work since them. I did 
</I>&gt;<i> contact Aur, and he is still around, but his military service 
</I>&gt;<i> precludes him from participating in the project. He may be free in, 
</I>&gt;<i> well, a couple of years. Hopefully we'll hear more from him then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He had distributed his code:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000219.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000219.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but I think that server may be no longer presenting his work.
