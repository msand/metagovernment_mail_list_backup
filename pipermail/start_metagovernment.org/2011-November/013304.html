<PRE>Hello Pietro,

After watching your video: I like, that you adress the problem of 
scalability. IMO this is *THE* problem of e-democracy. And as you know, 
in political science it is the main argument for representative 
democracy and against direct democracy.

And as you point out, the solution has to be some sort of distillation 
process where huge amounts of proposals get fused into a few.

Pleasse correct me, if I'm wrong with the following:

You suggest a four-stage-process: 1. many single proposals --&gt; 2. a few 
clusters of proposals --&gt; 3. a few proposals --&gt; 4. very few final proposals

 From 1. to 2. this is done by some math-algorithm. I suspect, this has 
immanent limitations. E.g. if the proposals only differ in a single 
number (lets say a proposed tax-rate). If you have every number between 
0 and 50, how can you cluster them? Why not let the voters themselves 
decide to come together and form clusters ... like in Votorola?

 From 2. to 3. (minute 17.00 in the youtube-video) this is done by the 
clarity working groups. Has every voter the right to be in one of the 
groups? For reasons of fairness, I guess yes. And the same from 3. to 4. 
everybody should be allowed to be in one of the integration working 
groups. But then the question comes up: how can thousands of voters in 
such a group come up with a consensus? I mean, this is the question we 
were all up to answer in the first place. ... In Votorola the clustering 
can happen in as many levels of depth as necesarry. This way all of the 
voters end up in self-chosen small groups of 5 to 15 members. A size, 
where people can still talk to each other and also listen. I guess more 
than 20 is to many.

Cheers,
Thomas
