<PRE>Hey Alex,

Thanks for suggesting this.  I see two parallel approaches: (1) offer
them Votorola to experiment with separately, as you suggest; and (2)
enable them to experiment with all vote-servers simultaneously by way
of vote mirroring and free-range voting.

(1) They could certainly experiment with Votorola.  They'd require 2
or 3 people who are engaged in some kind of consensus making effort
that is either text based or electoral.  They'd have to be a little
adventurous and unafraid to use rough alpha tools (not beta ready).
It might help to motivate them if they understood a little of the
theory, especially the significance of primary legislation and
non-party primary elections.  See the links in the figure caption at
bottom, for example: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/home.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/home.xht</A>

If anyone can find 2 or 3 such people in Frankfurt, then we can work
directly with them.  They don't need to host anything to start.  We
can get them started almost immediately (depending on when Thomas and
C are next free, as I don't speak German).

(2) Another approach is to ask the whole occupation for help in
getting Liquid Feedback, Votorola and other projects to cooperate by
cross-mirroring their votes.  This is the approach I'm currently
putting most of my own effort into:

If you find a technical list/forum in Frankfurt where it's OK to post
in English, please let me know.  I could post something like this:
