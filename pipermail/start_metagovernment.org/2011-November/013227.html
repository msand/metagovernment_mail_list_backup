Personally, I am not fond of Facebook at all. I find it to be  
primarily a tool for a few corporate interests to collect and exploit  
enormous amounts of personal information from people. Ironically, for  
the for-profit interests I work with, I manage three different  
Facebook pages, two with moderately high memberships.

If others want us to have a presence on Facebook, I won't stand in the  
way. But I would ask permission to be made an administrator, at least  
so I can change the graphic to something better. And also so I can do  
some promotion for it: if it's going to exist, it might as well thrive.

I'd like us to use Vilfredo whenever appropriate. There's no conflict  
with using it along with other tools, and it has unique advantages in  
its approach to synthesis building. (I still think there's a way to  
integrate Vilfredo into Outcast, or at least to get them to  
interrelate with each other.)

Pietro, would you like to be an admin of the Metagov account?
