My first impression is that the &quot;waiting period&quot; criteria, combined with
the threshold do indeed help to create spaces where longer term decisions
can be made. Putting on my hacker that, I'd say there were some dangers in
this approach, that maybe have been covered elsewhere?

Is there a danger of &quot;wait time creep&quot;, where over time more and more
decisions have arbitrary wait times attached to them? It is in the interest
of the person proposing a rule to apply the maximum wait time to a
decision, and it is not clear that we have adequate policing of this to
prevent a subtle process of ossification, or indeed deliberate
accumulations of lots of small pieces of red tape that are designed to make
some policy or other artificially hard to over turn.

Most people are interested in the meat of the question being discussed, and
not the more meta questions regarding procedure and time frames. Given the
nature of people and groups, it is easy in such situations for things to go
wrong. I think we need more of an explicit justification for these wait
times and thresholds. Trusting that these will emerge based on discussion
and LD voting on them alone, may work in the long term, but in the short
term will most likely create a lot of (unnecessary) tensions?
