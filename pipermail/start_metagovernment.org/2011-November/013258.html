<PRE>Hi Thomas,
thanks for the heads up.
Indeed I have missed it. I was very busy for the last months (couple of
years actually), and could not give it the attention it was due.

Now you gave me two links:
 <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G!p!m00">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G!p!m00</A>
and
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules</A>

Now the second is the leading solution. Ok. Now, so that I learn better to
use Votorola, how do I go from the first link to the second?

Also, can I just write my own draft version and vote for it? I have read
yours and I am not sure I understand, and even less that I agree with.

Also, it looks like you guys have made some cool hacks on the left. But I
don't fully understand them. Forgive them, you probably have explained them
hundreds of time. What I see is that it says, Ed Mi and if I hover over Ed,
some part of the page get greyed, if not some other part of the page. Does
this refer to who made what changes? Or to what do people support?

Sorry for all this. We have the same problem with Vilfredo. Where for us it
is absolutely obvious, and for each person that we drag to the site, it's a
mess. I am re-evaluating website design as a royal road to change the world.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> - Why do we need concencus at all? (Do we need concencus of all the voters
