<PRE>You guys are talking about Pietro's call for (1) strict objectivity or
&quot;fair participation&quot; and (2) a solution to zombie voters.

(1) I guess I disagree about strict objectivity.  Habermas says the
subject and social worlds just as important to consensus making as the
objective world.  If we we de-personalize and de-socialize the medium
by focusing exclusively on the content of the text, as Pietro
suggests, then we end up with a one-sided rationality.  In consensus
making, it matters greatly who the author is, and it matters greatly
who supports the text and who opposes it.

(2) Has anyone actually implmented &quot;rusting votes&quot; Thomas?  It sounds
like a good solution.

I think the design of Votorola allows for a better one.  Our users can
solve the problem themselves by simply talking to the zombie voters.
They can ask, &quot;Do you really want to continue voting for
Mr. Superstar?  Don't you realize he's changed his position since you
first supported him?&quot;

Then they listen to the answers.  (Maybe this is an example of how
socializing the medium solves a problem of irrationality.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - if it was a project that gets executed, the votes vanish after the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well yes. Such a poll somehow simply dries out, it dies.

</I>&gt;<i> Ack.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Vote Rusting&quot; is the better concept :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> @Anonymity
</I>&gt;<i> What about allowing people to vote anonymously, discuss anonymously,
</I>&gt;<i> propose anonymously, but once a proposal becomes &quot;active&quot;, the
</I>&gt;<i> identity of all voters will be revealed.
</I>&gt;<i> Would that help the &quot;Fair Participation Princple&quot; ?
</I>&gt;<i> ...so after a proposal became active, everyone will be able to do
</I>&gt;<i> research if there are sock puppets.
</I>&gt;<i> ...while its not active law, people might be anonymous or maybe they
</I>&gt;<i> even have to be anonymous.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's a serious issue, that in fact, people often do not mainly
</I>&gt;<i> react based on arguments that were brought up, but by status and other
</I>&gt;<i> heuristics.
</I>&gt;<i> Normaly, if u tell someone something, it's not so important what you
</I>&gt;<i> say, but who you are. Reactions will be very different, depending on
