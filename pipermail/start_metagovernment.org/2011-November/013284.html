<PRE>Pietro,

Your discussion of &quot;spectrum&quot; in the vote matrix at the Amazon site 
motivated me to suggest you take a look at some very interesting 
patterns in the Borda section (labeled &quot;Depth of Support&quot;) in the Indaba 
network.

Compare

<A HREF="https://wevote.net/?eid=294">https://wevote.net/?eid=294</A> and
<A HREF="https://wevote.net/?eid=313">https://wevote.net/?eid=313</A>


294 was a ballot used to pick a name for a Lacrosse team.
313 is based on published data in which professional coaches and 
journalists select college football champions in the US (because there 
is no equivalent of a playoff season).

Note that the football ballot finds consensus immediately, and that the 
Borda charts are clearly banded. Not a surprising result for 
professional judges.

The Lacrosse ballot requires several rounds to reach consensus, and the 
Borda shapes may be convex or concave, seeming to indicate whether the 
candidate is generally acceptable or polarizing.

&gt;<i> Hello everybody,

</I>&gt;<i> as promised, I shall try to present a video each week.

</I>&gt;<i> What is the idea behind this talk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of services out there permit to vote on proposals (or comments,
</I>&gt;<i> or pages, ...). But it is not always clear what the vote represent. We
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that voting should be done on a 2D triangular structure. Where
</I>&gt;<i> people can express rapidly what how much do they understand the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, and how much do they agree with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then we discuss how doing this would give the service using this
</I>&gt;<i> system some really powerful tool to aggregate proposals, and to
</I>&gt;<i> automatically suggest which proposals should be rewritten (and who
</I>&gt;<i> should rewrite them).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far the model is theoretical, but we are considering adding a
</I>&gt;<i> simplified version on Vilfredo. Simplified because the Pareto Front
</I>&gt;<i> does not play well with continuous valuation (it does work, it just
</I>&gt;<i> does not filter out enough proposals). But the idea is general, and
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else can also use it in their system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
