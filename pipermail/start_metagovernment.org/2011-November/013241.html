<PRE>Good point, so there should be a minimum time.

Regarding what does it mean to have consensus with big groups, that is
something that we have discussed a lot. And failed to reach consensus.
Although some disagree with that and thinks we reached consensus, just with
their definition of consensus. Alex, I think we are chatting too much on
the list. Please remember that there are hundreds of people on the list. If
you want to continue please make it on facebook (where people do not need
to receive an email everything we say), or on private message.
