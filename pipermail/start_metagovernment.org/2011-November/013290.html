<PRE>What is Occupy Frankfort (and other Occupy's) looking for in voting  
software? Are they looking to elect representatives or to devise  
solutions or to make decisions?

If they're looking to elect representatives, I hope someone is letting  
them know this is a destructive road to go down. Just think about the  
oxymoron &quot;union boss&quot; to get an idea of where it goes wrong.

If they are looking for a way to draft proposals and devise solutions,  
they may wish to consider Vilfredo, which has been progressing nicely.

If they are looking for a comprehensive decision-making solution, I  
have to agree with Michael that nothing is ready for prime-time, but I  
disagree with his idea that they should avoid implementing Votorola  
(or something else, but Votorola seems like it fits the bill best). If  
it's not ready for them, they can adapt and struggle and make it work.  
There will be problems, but they're problems that can be worked  
through offline and/or adapted to. This is the advantage of their  
being a physically close and ideologically similar community: if the  
software lets them down, they can still work it out.

Also, I agree it is useful to emphasize the crossforum to them.  
Whatever software they start with, they should be thinking about  
portability.

I admit we've been a bit confusing because we have two distinct  
projects pages. &quot;Active projects&quot; is supposed to be projects that are  
actively engaged in the Metagovernment community. &quot;Related projects&quot;  
is our much larger list of participatory democracy projects:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects</A>
(Both lists need some cleanup and expansion, if anyone has time to  
look at them.)
