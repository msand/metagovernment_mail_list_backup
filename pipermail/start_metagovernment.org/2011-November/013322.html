<PRE>Hi Michael,

When you say:
&gt;<i>&#160;In consensus
</I>&gt;<i> making, it matters greatly who the author is,
</I>
Are you saying that it has always been like this, or that it will
always be like this.

Because I do think we are breaking new grounds with the internet, so I
wouldn't be much surprised if &quot;rules&quot; which were true in real life
meeting might turn out to be not so universal in internet settings.

I think you are right when you say that only applying such principle
might bring to a very superficial rationalization of choices. But I am
not sure this cannot be avoided by making a more round system. For
example someone suggested in a recent conversation I had that people
should not just write their proposals, but also their necessities and
needs. Then other participants can join in if they have the same
needs. And when a proposal is presented, the author could express what
needs (that have been expressed) does he thinks it satisfies. With the
people having those needs then being invited to check if they agree
with this assessment and if they would like to support this proposal.

Something like this would probably permit a deeper decision to take
place. But it does not require people not to be anonymous. In fact
there are many needs human beings have that they would not feel
confortable discussing in public.


Have you read the book &quot;non violent communication&quot;? It was written by
Marshall Rosenberg, a student of Gandhi who structures communication
in 4 elements:
facts, needs, emotion and request. Maybe we need to develop something similar.

Pietro
