<PRE>It is important I think when discussing meta, or constitutional questions
to consider more deeply the concept of time, or more specifically the scope
of time as applied to particular decisions.

LD, or a naive conception of LD, implies that any decision can be decided
by anyone at any time. This is &quot;sort of&quot; true, but ignores some fundamental
issues. First it fails to understand that the framing of a question
determines the sort of answer that you can reasonably expect to receive,
and secondly it fails to take the opportunity to address a major flaw in
parliamentary democracy - both of which relate to time.

It is vital that different time frames are applied to different questions,
if you want a sensible answer. This is just common sense - you can't expect
people to apply a balanced sense of justice immediately after a crime or
personal tragedy, and you can't expect politicians to respond to long term
questions, when they are caught in a 4 year election cycle. Asking
questions with an immediate scope, will give radically different answers
compared to asking the same question framed with a long term scope (&quot;What
would you like for your children / grand children?&quot;). Environmental
questions in particular require a long term frame, which parliamentary
decision making fails to deliver, and financial (voting with your pocket)
based decision making equally fails. LD will fail to express peoples
genuine political preference if it is not able to ask long term questions.

Asking long term questions implies, a slower time scale. It implies
sticking to a plan, committing to a decision, even when the short term
considerations make this unpalatable. I can't see how this is possible (at
this stage), without allowing previous LD decisions to have an agreed time
scope, and for these to be binding and trump later decisions that may go
against the earlier long term vote. This is something that does not easily
fall out of a pure - vote any time on any decision conception of LD. The
freedom to vote on anything at any time, can restrict the freedom to able
able to make promises, commitments and long term plans. The real moral
authority of LD comes from the bottom up, network nature of the process,
not solely the freedom to vote on anything at any time.

With regard to constitutional decisions we need a longer time scale - how
do we build a &quot;long room&quot; for asking such questions in LD?

</I>&gt;<i>  In order to embed the principles discussed on this list (and being

</I>&gt;<i> that there is no or as little conflict as possible between the running of
</I>&gt;<i> the administrative system (ie the voting software), and the legal
</I>&gt;<i> governance, we need to choose a legal structure that allows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Full legal membership from individuals anywhere in the world.
</I>&gt;<i>    2. Zero administrative cost for adding and deleting members (including
</I>&gt;<i>    zero requirement for legal advice / costs). This would hinder extending
</I>&gt;<i>    membership to large numbers of people, and or members unwilling or unable
</I>&gt;<i>    to pay for full legal participation.
</I>&gt;<i>     3. No a priori or adhoc structure to the membership (such as fixed
</I>&gt;<i>    number and classification of a board of directors). This would impose a top
</I>&gt;<i>    down power structure on the decision making process, and cause artificial
</I>&gt;<i>    separation between the general membership and the decisions of the network.
</I>&gt;<i>    4. Full legal recognition of online voting, digital signatures,
</I>&gt;<i>    delegation and other means of voting where physical presence at meetings is
</I>&gt;<i>    not possible.
</I>&gt;<i>    5. Flexibility - the ability to change the structure of the legal
</I>&gt;<i>    structure through a vote of them members, suing the system of their
</I>&gt;<i>    preference (ie the software) at a time and in a manner of their choosing,
</I>&gt;<i>    without artificial restriction based on regional law, or based on
</I>&gt;<i>    prohibitive cost (by requiring for instance legal advice to make such
</I>&gt;<i>    changes).
</I>&gt;<i>    6. The ability to create a wide range of charitable, ethical,
</I>&gt;<i>    not-for-profit organisational structures - without restricting these to
</I>&gt;<i>    preconceived ideas of what constitutes &quot;charitable&quot; activity.
</I>&gt;<i>    7. The ability to create nested and / or p2p organisational (legal)
</I>&gt;<i>    structures. This allows the membership to structure legally binding
</I>&gt;<i>    decision making in a distributed, local, or domain specific fashion, and
</I>&gt;<i>    not be forced into central and hierarchical structures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Robust legal structures are possible, which allow the above. None of them
</I>&gt;<i> are perfect yet, but some of them are sufficiently simple and flexible to
</I>&gt;<i> allow us to create &quot;legal shells&quot; which embody our principles. It does
</I>&gt;<i> however rule out structures like Vereins, or classic charity structures, as
</I>&gt;<i> the legal hub so to speak, all though these can be incorporated as member
</I>&gt;<i> organisations with specific national or anational roles. The overall legal
</I>&gt;<i> architecture does not need to be complex, but should mirror / identify with
</I>&gt;<i> the software architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Yes, I think I am laying the groundwork for all of the above with the
</I>&gt;<i> draft charter
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft1">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft1</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I am keeping it deliberately extremely simple at first so we can build
</I>&gt;<i> consensus around the basics. We can flesh out the details once we have
</I>&gt;<i> passed that first step. Please feel free to edit as appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  What I still don't know is what existing legal structures we can look to
</I>&gt;<i> to help us create a formally-recognized organization. You indicate that you
</I>&gt;<i> are aware of some of these; can you please list some so I can research
</I>&gt;<i> them? I will have limited availability for the next week, but I am very
</I>&gt;<i> eager to explore this further to see if we can get this moving forward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Clearly it is important to embody the mission charter in the
</I>&gt;<i> constitutional structure. However what is important is how it is agreed /
</I>&gt;<i> created and how it is changed. The &quot;change rules&quot; need to be according to
</I>&gt;<i> the principles of the LD software and not some rigid / historically
</I>&gt;<i> inherited / regional legal structure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The rules that my draft links to were developed by using Votorola to
</I>&gt;<i> create a decision-making algorithm for editing our own wiki with consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is a good starting point for the basis of the organization as a
</I>&gt;<i> whole, no?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. Concerning version control for policy-making, you are echoing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concepts first proposed on this list by Aur Saraf, who started building
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such a system. You may want to look at some of his writings, starting with:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000187.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000187.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He hasn't been active on the list since he got pulled into the military,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I will cc him on this in case he's available to coordinate with you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes - that would be good. I read the above, and generally agree with it.
</I>&gt;<i> It's the implementation that counts I guess - has there been any discussion
</I>&gt;<i> of mobile and in particular mobile app creation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Aur started developing the bare shell of the DVCS-based system, and then
</I>&gt;<i> he got drafted. Nobody has picked up his work since them. I did contact
</I>&gt;<i> Aur, and he is still around, but his military service precludes him from
</I>&gt;<i> participating in the project. He may be free in, well, a couple of years.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully we'll hear more from him then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  He had distributed his code:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000219.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000219.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but I think that server may be no longer presenting his work.
