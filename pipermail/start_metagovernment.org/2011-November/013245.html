<PRE>Not sure you want to give up the role of leadership. What if we do the
following, plan an end date to phase out the involvement of leaders? If
leadership rotates we become a more democratic community.

&gt;<i> Hi, folks. Just to clarify: this organization process is not just about
</I>&gt;<i> becoming eligible to receive grant funding. It is also to prove to
</I>&gt;<i> ourselves and the world that we can do this. Are we able to create a
</I>&gt;<i> real-world, formal organization that has no individual leader or leaders?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the most crucial test will be to see if we can manage money. Once
</I>&gt;<i> we have a basic charter we agree on, I would like to contribute money and
</I>&gt;<i> ask others to do so as well, and then make our first spending on legal fees
</I>&gt;<i> and filing fees for the organization (if we have consensus, of course). If
</I>&gt;<i> we can pass that test, we can begin to prove that we are capable of
</I>&gt;<i> governance without empowered leaders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have continued to look into the requirements for organization. At least
</I>&gt;<i> here in the U.S., it looks like a board of directors is a requirement. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe we can get around this requirement by promoting everyone who
</I>&gt;<i> participates in the project to the board of directors. If we have to do
</I>&gt;<i> this, it wall affect the charter below: we will have to lay out in clear
</I>&gt;<i> language when someone becomes a voting member.  We can't just let anyone
</I>&gt;<i> immediately become a voting member, or else a group of people could easily
</I>&gt;<i> hijack the organization's funding for their own purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And to create a membership requirement, our software needs to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> register activity. For example, if we say someone must have been active in
</I>&gt;<i> discussion for the past month, then we need to validate that so we can
</I>&gt;<i> scale. Is that possible in any member project's software? Or can anyone
</I>&gt;<i> think of another way to do this? Or is there something better than an
</I>&gt;<i> activity meter to gauge eligibility?

</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone else provide input on this? The idea is to create a basic

</I>&gt;<i> After that I (and others) can start writing grant proposals to foundations
</I>&gt;<i> in order to fund projects (code development, outreach, sponsoring member
</I>&gt;<i> projects, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the modified (skeleton of the) charter I am proposing, based on
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas' input:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. High-level decisions of the organization (including budgeting
</I>&gt;<i> decisions) are to be made by using Outcast and/or governance software of a
</I>&gt;<i> member project. These decisions will follow a decision-rule similar to the
</I>&gt;<i> one we defined for editing the home page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Day-to-day activities may be handled by individuals ad hoc, or more
</I>&gt;<i> formally by individual employees or volunteers of the organization. Any
</I>&gt;<i> decision made by an individual must be publicly documented and can be
</I>&gt;<i> overridden by the process in #1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Modification of the charter can only be done by a supermajority similar
</I>&gt;<i> to the ruleset modification-rule set out in the link above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this reasonable, workable, and appropriate?
</I>&gt;<i>
