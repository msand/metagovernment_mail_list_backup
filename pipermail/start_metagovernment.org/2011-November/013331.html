<PRE>Hey Mike,


&gt;<i> I'm asking myself that after my experience in this OWS thread:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/structure/forum/topic/what-about-the-people-who-dont-have-time-to-go-to-general-assemblies-enough/">http://www.nycga.net/groups/structure/forum/topic/what-about-the-people-who-dont-have-time-to-go-to-general-assemblies-enough/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas, are you following?
</I>
yes.

&gt;<i> I think we need to automate draft creation
</I>&gt;<i> for new users, kind of like we did for remote drafts here in Metagov.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe also automate registration in the pollwiki, making it part of
</I>&gt;<i> login to the vote-server.
</I>
Both would be great!

Yes, but in the case of poll-zombies this means, you try to reach them 
in this regard and they dont answer. You might even go to their house, 
they are alive and healthy but as soon as you ask about the poll, they 
say &quot;Go away! Now!&quot; ... lol. What to do with their vote? I'd say, let it 
rust away ... dont let it sit there for 25 years.

Thomas
