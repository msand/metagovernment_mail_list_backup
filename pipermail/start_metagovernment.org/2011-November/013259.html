We have a web page for individuals to check their own eligibility, and
automations that verify each voter is eligible and scratch their vote
if they are not eligible.

e.g.
<A HREF="http://toolserver.org/~pathoschild/accounteligibility/">http://toolserver.org/~pathoschild/accounteligibility/</A>

For the Wikimedia Board of Trustees election, a list of all eligible
accounts is compiled and given to SPI, who run the election.

&gt;<i> Also, counting edits for a wiki makes a lot of sense, but what counts for
</I>&gt;<i> us?
</I>
wiki edits, mailing list posts, etc.  MG would probably want to
include activity on sister-projects.
Wikimedia has counters for all our mailing lists; there are quite a
few email stats packages like this - the most important feature is
collating posts by one person with two email addresses.

&gt;<i> So far, the rule we have used in small-scale decisions has been
</I>&gt;<i> participation on this list in the previous month.
</I>
Whenever we have a threshold for Wikimedia decision making processes,
there is someone who 'should' be included but is disenfranchised by
'the rules'.  Wikimedia often have a discussion before the 'vote'
about which threshold is suitable for the specific item to be voted
on.

I think 'activity in the previous month' would disenfranchise too many
people who have been very active but are busy for a month or two with
other parts of their life.
