No, i did not miss it, but i also did not vote for it as you can see in the
vote tree. (For i wasnt really convinced but i also found it complicated to
vote for it, but thats just an interface issues ;-) )

I was discussing it with Pietro, because i feel the rule as it is now is
far from perfect. To me it just does not feel natural. The concept behind
votorola feels very natural, but not the ruleset (W,T,P) as it is now. I
remember talking to you about the number of people that vote for a rule
will increase or decrease the time needed for the rule to become effective.
(similar to what Ed Pastore said about Aktiv Demokrati)

&gt;<i>From the perspective of a single voter, the question about &quot;waiting
</I>periods&quot; is somehow tied to his personal &quot;news system&quot;...
A single voter in a global world wants to know about all the rules that
might change soon and that will affect him personally in one way or
another., BUT: he doesnt want to spend all of his time searching or looking
for rules that might change an affect him in a negative way...
If &quot;Waiting Period W&quot; is just set to the arbitrary value of &quot;3 Weeks&quot; or &quot;1
week&quot;, that seems to be oversimplified.
It should depend on the people involved and it should depend on the
importance of the issue/rule/law that is proposed, thus the importance
should somehow affect if information about it pops up in a voters &quot;news
inbox&quot; or not.

The questions are:
- Why do we need waiting time's at all? (On which factors should the
waiting time depend?)
- Why do we need concencus at all? (Do we need concencus of all the voters
to set a standard for noise control or the requirement to wear a helmet in
power plants?)
