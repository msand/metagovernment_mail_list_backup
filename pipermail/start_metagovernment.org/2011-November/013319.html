<PRE>Hi all,



the system of &quot;liquid democracy&quot; or, proxy voting, is a system that has a proven reputation for decades now in, even the biggest, corporations. It is slightly different from what we present in the political area but nevertheless the technique is very similar. 

This technique is called &quot;shareholders meeting&quot; and shareholders can appoint a &quot;delegate&quot; when they want and who they want. In most cases that I know of the &quot;delegate&quot; is a specialised law firm that represents a number of shareholders who have a specific view on things.

Of course we, as citizens, must have each an equal share in our community and we want to express our opinion when we want and not once a year.

But with those exceptions there are strong similarities in my view. 

&gt;<i>From there, and somewhat related with the &quot;zombie delegation&quot; I came to the question &quot;will or can delegates be paid&quot; like the delegates in the shareholders meeting? If paid the chances for &quot;zombie delegation&quot; will be less obvious. Now we are also paying our &quot;delegates&quot; (the chosen representatives). Is there any opinion about this? Maybe we can think about this along the lines of <A HREF="http://flattr.com/">http://flattr.com/</A> . Every citizen receives a budget funded from taxes that he can spend, or not, for delegation (nothing else). Just a first idea. This is not compatible with my first statement that it can avoid &quot;zombie votes&quot; but I have to start somewhere.

  @ Mike


(2) Has anyone actually implmented &quot;rusting votes&quot; Thomas?  It sounds
like a good solution.

  I know of no implementation. Just a concept so far, I guess. Basically it fits into what we picture as a vote-filter. I.e. filter out all votes which are older than 2 years, and half of all the votes which are older than 1 year, ... and all the ones which are from voters outside the voting district, ... 


I think the design of Votorola allows for a better one.  Our users can
solve the problem themselves by simply talking to the zombie voters.
They can ask, &quot;Do you really want to continue voting for
Mr. Superstar?  Don't you realize he's changed his position since you
first supported him?&quot;

Then they listen to the answers.  (Maybe this is an example of how
socializing the medium solves a problem of irrationality.)

  But, what if they don't answer?

  Best, 
  Thomas
