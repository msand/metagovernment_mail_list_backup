<PRE>Dear fellow MetaGovernment participants,
dear Ed,

here is my video for this week.
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYNGW04GmVw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYNGW04GmVw</A>

In this video I tried to explain the summary table in Vilfredo. The summary
table was my summer work, and it really helps in seeing all in one glance
what has been going on in a question. Who was participating, who was not,
in what ways. And in particular it shows very well which are the
participants that tend to only vote for their own proposal. This with the
aim of discouraging this behavior, as well as showing when a partial
consensus has been reached. That is a consensus... except for the
participants who only vote for themselves.

Partial consensus is not full consensus, but if a community keep on
reaching partial consensus except for a single member, it might be the case
to speak with this member, or maybe even consider if it wouldn't be more
beneficial to proceed anyway without this member.

I also started ordering the video in two playlists. One that is focused on
Vilfredo (and all the video to explain it), and one that is more general.
Playlist 1 on Vilfredo:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD045DE61065754CA">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD045DE61065754CA</A>
Playlist 2 on Fair Democracy:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0458626DE65DD93">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0458626DE65DD93</A>

Please give me feedback on this last video. It is different from all the
others, in the sense that I recorded it here at home. On my home computer.
So it feels different. More relaxed, less adrenaline. But I am not sure if
this is a plus or a minus. Also I am new to this whole business of making
those videos, so any suggestion in htis will also be appreciated.

Cheers,
Pietro
