You may need to file paperwork every time there is a change of
directors which would make this approach costly.

You should be able to set up the rules (constitution/charter) such
that the board of directors are powerless to do anything without
member consensus.

Someone else has mentioned a rotating board of directors; I think that
would be good to prevent it becoming a role with power or status.

&gt;<i> If we have to do
</I>&gt;<i> this, it wall affect the charter below: we will have to lay out in clear
</I>&gt;<i> language when someone becomes a voting member. &#160;We can't just let anyone
</I>&gt;<i> immediately become a voting member, or else a group of people could easily
</I>&gt;<i> hijack the organization's funding for their own purposes.

Over at wikimedia we usually disenfrancise community members who
havent reached a certain edit-count, and we also require a limited
number of edits in the preceding twelve months.

the last requirements were: &quot;
# have made at least 300 edits before 15 April 2011 across Wikimedia
wikis (edits on several wikis can be combined if your accounts are
unified into a global account); and
# have made at least 20 edits between 15 November 2010 and 15 May 2011.
