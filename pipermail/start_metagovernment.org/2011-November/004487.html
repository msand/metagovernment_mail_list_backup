<PRE>Hey there,

i've met with some of the people that occupy the space in front of the
european central bank here in frankfurt/germany.
They have WLAN and and Intranet now and they recently started to think
about how to use this new connectivity for consensus building.
I've met with them in order to help them with the organisation of workshops
that try to discuss the current monetary system so that they might develop
an alternative or at least get to know about alternatives that are already
discussed elsewhere, like &quot;monetative.org&quot;.

Currently they also experiment with the &quot;Liquid Feedback&quot; software, but i
think votorola might be the better tool for their purpose.
Is it possible to use votorola? I'll meet again with them this week and
also i've already started to tell them about metagovernment.org and what it
is and what we do and also about votorola, i could need more input.
They have their own IT folks. They run their intranet and give technical
support on any issue that might occur. Maybe I can convince some of them to
join this mailinglist, but until then, i'd like to know if its possible for
them to host and use votorola for their purpose.
