<PRE>Hi Pietro,

&gt;<i> Now you gave me two links:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G!p!m00">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G!p!m00</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G%21p%21m00">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G%21p%21m00</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now the second is the leading solution. Ok. Now, so that I learn 
</I>&gt;<i> better to use Votorola, how do I go from the first link to the second?
</I>
Ok, you click on the little dot in front of the name and on the upcoming 
page you click on the draft pointer link.
For the other voters and their positions it is the same. To browse 
through the vote-tree, click on the candidates names.

&gt;<i> Also, can I just write my own draft version and vote for it? I have 
</I>&gt;<i> read yours and I am not sure I understand, and even less that I agree 
</I>&gt;<i> with.
</I>
Yes, I think it would be good, if you would write your own draft version 
in the Metagov-Wiki, so we can compare our versions, maybe merge parts 
of it etc.. With Votorola you can not vote for your own draft. I guess 
we figure, that it is clear enough that you are in favour of your own 
version. Though I myself would also like to express that explicitly with 
a vote for myself, hm ... But you can ofc collect votes for your draft. 
If I like yours, I vote for it.

&gt;<i> Also, it looks like you guys have made some cool hacks on the left. 
</I>&gt;<i> But I don't fully understand them. Forgive them, you probably have 
</I>&gt;<i> explained them hundreds of time. What I see is that it says, Ed Mi and 
</I>&gt;<i> if I hover over Ed, some part of the page get greyed, if not some 
</I>&gt;<i> other part of the page. Does this refer to who made what changes? Or 
</I>&gt;<i> to what do people support?
</I>
It shows the parts which differ between Eds draft and mine for example. 
Click on Ed to fix this view and then click on the symbol &quot;)(&quot; of a 
specific difference and it leads you to the difference-bridge (as we 
call it). There I can pull Eds suggestions into my draft, if I like them.

&gt;<i> Sorry for all this. We have the same problem with Vilfredo. Where for 
</I>&gt;<i> us it is absolutely obvious, and for each person that we drag to the 
</I>&gt;<i> site, it's a mess. I am re-evaluating website design as a royal road 
</I>&gt;<i> to change the world.
</I>
No problem.

Cheers,
Thomas

</I>&gt;<i>     No, i did not miss it, but i also did not vote for it as you can
</I>&gt;<i>     see in the vote tree. (For i wasnt really convinced but i also
</I>&gt;<i>     found it complicated to vote for it, but thats just an interface
</I>&gt;<i>     issues ;-) )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I was discussing it with Pietro, because i feel the rule as it is
</I>&gt;<i>     now is far from perfect. To me it just does not feel natural. The
</I>&gt;<i>     concept behind votorola feels very natural, but not the ruleset
</I>&gt;<i>     (W,T,P) as it is now. I remember talking to you about the number
</I>&gt;<i>     of people that vote for a rule will increase or decrease the time
</I>&gt;<i>     needed for the rule to become effective.
</I>&gt;<i>     (similar to what Ed Pastore said about Aktiv Demokrati)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     From the perspective of a single voter, the question about
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;waiting periods&quot; is somehow tied to his personal &quot;news system&quot;...
</I>&gt;<i>     A single voter in a global world wants to know about all the rules
</I>&gt;<i>     that might change soon and that will affect him personally in one
</I>&gt;<i>     way or another., BUT: he doesnt want to spend all of his time
</I>&gt;<i>     searching or looking for rules that might change an affect him in
</I>&gt;<i>     a negative way...
</I>&gt;<i>     If &quot;Waiting Period W&quot; is just set to the arbitrary value of &quot;3
</I>&gt;<i>     Weeks&quot; or &quot;1 week&quot;, that seems to be oversimplified.
</I>&gt;<i>     It should depend on the people involved and it should depend on
</I>&gt;<i>     the importance of the issue/rule/law that is proposed, thus the
</I>&gt;<i>     importance should somehow affect if information about it pops up
</I>&gt;<i>     in a voters &quot;news inbox&quot; or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The questions are:
</I>&gt;<i>     - Why do we need waiting time's at all? (On which factors should
</I>&gt;<i>     the waiting time depend?)
</I>&gt;<i>     - Why do we need concencus at all? (Do we need concencus of all
</I>&gt;<i>     the voters to set a standard for noise control or the requirement
</I>&gt;<i>     to wear a helmet in power plants?)
</I>&gt;<i>
