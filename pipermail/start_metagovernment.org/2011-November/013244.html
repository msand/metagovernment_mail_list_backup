<PRE>One issue arises for me Pietro re rules and politics.
In families there are often unspoken rules and a rule not to speak of these
rules. I someone in the family does they are often labeled as a problem or
even said to be crazy for thinking or saying such a thing. This is the
phenomenon of scapegoating. How are you going to deal with this issue in
your proposal?

&gt;<i> As we are discussing ways to govern ourselves, there is something I would

</I>&gt;<i> But I'll do it in another thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a sense we are trying to define some rules that should govern ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But this brings two questions. (1) how are those rules decided and (2) how
</I>&gt;<i> can those rules change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How are those rules decided is generally the center stage of our
</I>&gt;<i> discussion. How to decide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But now I would like to suggest something about the number 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My idea is that every rule should have a time t. The time that is needed
</I>&gt;<i> to change the rule. More basic rules will have longer times, less important
</I>&gt;<i> rules will have shorter times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is that anyone can, in any moment, propose a change in a rule.
</I>&gt;<i> If no one protests after t time has passed, the proposed change is
</I>&gt;<i> automatically accepted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If instead someone protest, than we use one of our tool to settle the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion. While the discussion is going on, the old rule still applies.
</I>&gt;<i> Once the discussion is settled, it will still not be valid the new rule
</I>&gt;<i> until a time of t is passed. If anyone in this time t is not happy with the
</I>&gt;<i> result he can open everything again. And still the old rule applies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will make quite hard to change the rule. But it also gives stability.
</I>&gt;<i> You know what the rules are, and you know you can go on vacation for t-1
</I>&gt;<i> days and you know when you come back you are still going to find the same
</I>&gt;<i> rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The time t should be specified in every rule, but when it is not specified
</I>&gt;<i> it can be defined as (I don't know, 1 month?). Changing the length of t for
</I>&gt;<i> a certain rule, counts as a change.
</I>&gt;<i> I would take what I described above as a rule (rule can speak about other
</I>&gt;<i> rules), but with a very long t (something between 3 months and 1 year).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been using a similar system before with great success. But this is
</I>&gt;<i> the first time I describe it in public.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet it is quite similar to the way constitutions works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
