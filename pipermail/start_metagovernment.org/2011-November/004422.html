Hi Matteo,

&gt;<i> thanks for your reply.
</I>&gt;<i> Agora 2.0 is still at the early stages of programming (if they have
</I>&gt;<i> even started) and they are still discussion about how to set up the
</I>&gt;<i> programming framework, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> As for really starting a collaboration in concrete terms between
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola and Agora now, I think this may be too early as they have
</I>&gt;<i> still to start on their platform.
</I>
Yes, but to start a platform you have to know what is necessary and 
what is not. I don't think that yet another code base is a good idea, 
especially since we can even offer Java support. Our software is modular 
and we put a lot of work in to keep the different technological concepts 
modular and extendable. Even if something needed is not there, it is in 
my experience much less work to talk about a collaboration first. The 
technical duplication and additional effort to lobby another code base 
just for the sake to have your own rules is a very week way to go for an 
edem-project imo. I would recommend them to come to us and talk about 
the concepts first and what they want to do. This has nothing to do with 
coding, but rather with a profound understanding of the modelled 
democratic process.

&gt;<i> I have repeatedly invited them to have a look at Votorola before
</I>&gt;<i> starting, I am not sure they have done this, as they want to develop
</I>&gt;<i> their own platform at the moment.
</I>
I guess they haven't. When I searched for a project to participate in 
with my ideas it took me several weeks to check out different projects 
and read about the concepts. Only then I have started to play around 
with the code of LiquidFeedback and the online interface of Adhocracy. I 
have discovered Votorola late in this process and tended to use 
something else at first, but the reading of the theory and understanding 
of the concepts totally changed my mind before I have written a single 
line of code.

&gt;<i> As for my previous requests, I was just asking for a 2-3 page small
</I>&gt;<i> document with some pictures of the main features of Votorola and few
</I>&gt;<i> lines to explain not in detail at all.
</I>
Ok. This makes some sense. But you do understand that we write a 
&quot;lobbying&quot; tool for everybody acting as an &quot;activist&quot;, so our tools 
should advertise themselves? I think you could help with the mockups and 
ask others what they think about the concepts by linking to our work on 
the votorola list. Maybe this is more attractive. On the way you can 
give us feedback yourself, because you act like an &quot;activist&quot;.

&gt;<i> This would have been maybe 30 minutes of work or less for you, but as
</I>&gt;<i> for me it would have required me to learn how the interface and the
</I>&gt;<i> difference bridge works, which would have taken me much more time.
</I>&gt;<i> (the videos made by Thomas were appreciated, but still they started 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> ask other questions about how Votorola works in detail for the
</I>&gt;<i> amendment of laws, etc.)
</I>
The difference bridge shows the differences between any two positions 
in a poll. It is mostly used between voter and candidate to discuss 
changes or better wording, while being able to keep controversial 
differences. It is the raw material for the discussion and after the 
discussion has come to a better wording/concept in the draft the patch 
button allows the voter or candidate to patch single improvements into 
any of the two drafts. This makes large scale discussion with individual 
positions possible, as changes can move up and down the tree without the 
need to draft a new position. What you have seen on the bridge was first 
a difference in wording and second below a difference in formatting, 
which looked like code to you. We don't hide that atm., but we can do so 
in the future. But to keep formatting inline allows us to merge that 
with the difference patching as well, so no need yet to hide the html 
formatting &quot;code&quot; of the draft. This also only a problem for the 
homepage, because it is written in Html and not MediaWiki markup.

&gt;<i> I thought that this could be helpful for you as well, as you may be
</I>&gt;<i> willing to invite other people to join in the future, but this does
</I>&gt;<i> not have to be done now, maybe later on is OK, the decision is up to
</I>&gt;<i> you.
</I>
We are doing a new Ui atm. I would do that once the Ui works for basic 
things like resource management and voting. If we document the legacy Ui 
with videos and stuff now, we will have to drop it anyway in the next 
year or so. But maybe the next year is crucial and it is worth it 
anyway. I think Thomas does a good job with screencasts and some videos 
can indeed be helpful now. But maybe only the main concepts?

&gt;<i> In any case, this can be done later when you feel it is appropriated.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not want to make you lose any time, so please feel free to read
</I>&gt;<i> quickly this and no obligation to reply.
</I>
Thanks. I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate your interest 
and commitment and that this criticism is not meant personal or 
disencouraging, but rather focusing on a different strategy.

&gt;<i> As for my contribution, I am not a programmer so I am currently
</I>&gt;<i> working with you, them, and other groups in order to make people talk
</I>&gt;<i> together and avoid unneccessary duplications of work.
</I>
This is very good!

&gt;<i> This is taking quite some of my time.
</I>
I can imagine that myself.

&gt;<i> I am currently trying to help the guys of E2DI to set up a forum 
</I>&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;<i> to post the specifications of Votorola for what we know and keep the
</I>&gt;<i> status of development updated.
</I>
Good.

&gt;<i> I do not know if we will be able to do that, just trying.
</I>&gt;<i> This is how I am imaging my contribution.
</I>
Can you imagine to use our tools yourself to do this very job of 
bringing people together?

&gt;<i> If you have any other ideas, you can contact me now, or in the 
</I>&gt;<i> future,
</I>&gt;<i> I am available to listen even months from now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Matteo
</I>
Ok, good. We are not in a hurry, although I hope to get the new Ui up 
as soon as possible.

conseo
