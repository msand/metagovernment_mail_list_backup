<PRE>&gt;<i> What????? the most important link from a page and you hide it in this
</I>way? Com'on!
&gt;<i> Please look at ifttt.com for an example of how to make things absolutely
</I>OBVIOUS (as they should be).
&gt;<i> Do we have any person who is studying design and usability on the list? I
</I>think both Votorola and Vilfredo might use your help ;-).

Yeah ;-) I already complained about usability a lot....
Some months ago i proposed to redisign the user interface in powerpoint,
maybe with the help of Thomas or someone who would like to work on UI
improvements?
The problem i'm currently facing is that my time is so limited. As soon as
i've finished my thesis and the last couple of exams i will have more time
and if the UI problem is not solved by then, i would really like to help
out. ...but it might take a couple of month until that happens.


&gt;<i> I am re-evaluating website design as a royal road to change the world.
</I>
Totally agree with it, it's the royal road :-)
