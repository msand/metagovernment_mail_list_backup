As mentioned: www.aktivdemokrati.se/manifesto (Active Democracy) has an
integral model that decides on the voting time based on the degree of
consensus and the number of participants. The effect is that discussions
can continue until consensus is reached. And more time is given if the
disagreement is big or if the participation is low.

But we also has the concept of continual democracy, with votings that
never has a resolution time.

Say for example we have an organization with a yearly membership fee. We
would then have a continous median voting. Everybode can put in a number
in the given currency. The median value will be calculated. And if the
median value changes and stays the same under a certain time (2 weeks)
the new value will be announced as the new membership fee.

The same kind of thing can be done for laws. They can be open for
continous votes and can go away if the support goes down.
