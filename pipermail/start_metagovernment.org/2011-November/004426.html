<PRE>Yes, you've defined what I am trying to build and yes I agree that as  
much as possible we want to be a-national. I would be very interested  
in hearing any more thoughts you may have, particularly on what  
countries might present the best options.

Some of our earlier research on the topic is documented here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Organization">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Organization</A>
but that is rather out of date. Please do follow-up as soon as you can.

Concerning embedding principles, are you suggesting that integrating  
the mission into the charter will prevent co-option? How about  
something like this?
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft1">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft1</A>


P.S. Concerning version control for policy-making, you are echoing the  
concepts first proposed on this list by Aur Saraf, who started  
building such a system. You may want to look at some of his writings,  
starting with:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000187.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000187.html</A>
He hasn't been active on the list since he got pulled into the  
military, but I will cc him on this in case he's available to  
coordinate with you.

</I>&gt;<i> of the organisation and the LD software that runs it. It is my view

</I>&gt;<i> Some countries have legislation that makes this easier than others,

</I>&gt;<i> regardless of nationality, or residency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope to be able to offer more discussion on this after next week.

</I>&gt;<i> NB - as an aside the software I am working on is a distributed wiki,  
</I>&gt;<i> in which everything is built on top of a distributed version control  
</I>&gt;<i> system. I see this, as a foundation for LD, in that we have robust  
</I>&gt;<i> distributed storage of documents and media, and can also clone and  
</I>&gt;<i> diff documents. Top priority at the moment is to make the  
</I>&gt;<i> installation process as easy as possible. The idea is that every  
</I>&gt;<i> software instance is able to store it's own social graph, so that  
</I>&gt;<i> even mobile clients would act as &quot;Freedom Boxes&quot; as Eben Moglen  
</I>&gt;<i> would say. I'd be really interested in catching up on the latest  
</I>&gt;<i> thinking on interoperability so all these distributed instances  
</I>&gt;<i> could talk to the server based implementations.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi, folks. Just to clarify: this organization process is not just  
</I>&gt;<i> about becoming eligible to receive grant funding. It is also to  
</I>&gt;<i> prove to ourselves and the world that we can do this. Are we able to  
</I>&gt;<i> create a real-world, formal organization that has no individual  
</I>&gt;<i> leader or leaders?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the most crucial test will be to see if we can manage  
</I>&gt;<i> money. Once we have a basic charter we agree on, I would like to  
</I>&gt;<i> contribute money and ask others to do so as well, and then make our  
</I>&gt;<i> first spending on legal fees and filing fees for the organization  
</I>&gt;<i> (if we have consensus, of course). If we can pass that test, we can  
</I>&gt;<i> begin to prove that we are capable of governance without empowered  
</I>&gt;<i> leaders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have continued to look into the requirements for organization. At  
</I>&gt;<i> least here in the U.S., it looks like a board of directors is a  
</I>&gt;<i> requirement. I believe we can get around this requirement by  
</I>&gt;<i> promoting everyone who participates in the project to the board of  
</I>&gt;<i> directors. If we have to do this, it wall affect the charter below:  
</I>&gt;<i> we will have to lay out in clear language when someone becomes a  
</I>&gt;<i> voting member.  We can't just let anyone immediately become a voting  
</I>&gt;<i> member, or else a group of people could easily hijack the  
</I>&gt;<i> organization's funding for their own purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And to create a membership requirement, our software needs to be  
</I>&gt;<i> able to register activity. For example, if we say someone must have  
</I>&gt;<i> been active in discussion for the past month, then we need to  
</I>&gt;<i> validate that so we can scale. Is that possible in any member  
</I>&gt;<i> project's software? Or can anyone think of another way to do this?  
</I>&gt;<i> Or is there something better than an activity meter to gauge  
</I>&gt;<i> eligibility?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is the modified (skeleton of the) charter I am proposing,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on Thomas' input:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. High-level decisions of the organization (including budgeting  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions) are to be made by using Outcast and/or governance  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software of a member project. These decisions will follow a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision-rule similar to the one we defined for editing the home  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Day-to-day activities may be handled by individuals ad hoc, or  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more formally by individual employees or volunteers of the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organization. Any decision made by an individual must be publicly  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documented and can be overridden by the process in #1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Modification of the charter can only be done by a supermajority  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar to the ruleset modification-rule set out in the link above.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this reasonable, workable, and appropriate?
