<PRE>Thanks for the link, Ed. Perhaps we can help each other expand and cleanup
the lists.


And I certainly hope that nobody is spreading the notion that oxymorons
cannot work because that is exactly our model (e.g. non-partisan political
parties)! ;-)

Having elected representatives is only &quot;a destructive road to go down&quot; when
they are NOT legally bound to act according to the will of the people (as
all are currently).

Please read the Pledge to Direct Democracy to understand how this changes
everything:

<A HREF="http://e2d-international.org/the-pledge/">http://e2d-international.org/the-pledge/</A>

I, _____________________, pledge to respect the collective views of my
&gt;<i> fellow citizens, those who duly elected me to represent their voice in the
</I>&gt;<i> legislature, on every issue, regardless of my personal beliefs and/or my
</I>&gt;<i> affiliate party's political agenda.
</I>


&gt;<i> In the event that I am unable to fulfill this pledge, and/or at the
</I>&gt;<i> request of the citizenry, I shall, at my own cost and volition, immediately
</I>&gt;<i> withdraw my nomination, resign as a candidate or resign my appointment in
</I>&gt;<i> the legislature, as applicable, and do any other act necessary to give
</I>&gt;<i> effect to this Pledge.
</I>

This pledge, legal in some cases, would effectively render elected
representatives powerless, incorruptible and legal servants of the
collective will of their constituents.

NOTE: To be used only when it is otherwise impossible to directly introduce
electronic direct democracy in a system (e.g. established systems already
running representative democracy models such as Parliament, Congress,
Council, Condo boards, Unions, etc.). In cases such as Occupy Frankfurt and
others, such hybrid methods of introduction would not be required, as they
do not need to fight within pre-existing representative structures but
thought I would share for possible future reference, if anyone wishes to
enter the world of traditional politics and ensure not losing sight of
their principles.

All the best,

-JF

What is Occupy Frankfort (and other Occupy's) looking for in voting
software? Are they looking to elect representatives or to devise solutions
or to make decisions?

If they're looking to elect representatives, I hope someone is letting them
know this is a destructive road to go down. Just think about the oxymoron
&quot;union boss&quot; to get an idea of where it goes wrong.

If they are looking for a way to draft proposals and devise solutions, they
may wish to consider Vilfredo, which has been progressing nicely.

If they are looking for a comprehensive decision-making solution, I have to
agree with Michael that nothing is ready for prime-time, but I disagree
with his idea that they should avoid implementing Votorola (or something
else, but Votorola seems like it fits the bill best). If it's not ready for
them, they can adapt and struggle and make it work. There will be problems,
but they're problems that can be worked through offline and/or adapted to.
This is the advantage of their being a physically close and ideologically
similar community: if the software lets them down, they can still work it
out.

Also, I agree it is useful to emphasize the crossforum to them. Whatever
software they start with, they should be thinking about portability.

I also immediately see some overlap between the list of Active Projects on
metagovernment.org but also ones that could be added to both lists:


I admit we've been a bit confusing because we have two distinct projects
pages. &quot;Active projects&quot; is supposed to be projects that are actively
engaged in the Metagovernment community. &quot;Related projects&quot; is our much
larger list of participatory democracy projects:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects</A>
(Both lists need some cleanup and expansion, if anyone has time to look at
them.)
