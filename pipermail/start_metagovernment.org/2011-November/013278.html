<PRE>Hi Alex,

I am one of the early supporters of Monetative <A HREF="http://www.monetative.de/?page_id=1091">http://www.monetative.de/?page_id=1091</A> and I have a ppt presentation there. But lets stay with the subject.
Is it possible to point also to the E2D possibilty for those who want to get involved in a direct action towards democracy.
<A HREF="http://e2d-international.org/">http://e2d-international.org/</A>  (the Demoex system)

Our elected representatives will always vote accordingly to the citizens vote on a dedicated website. Always and on any subject. 

this is an example from SOL (Australia):


&quot;&quot; How would SOL work?

The current website is a pre-election website that lays out how Senator Online would work if a SOL senator is elected.

In simple terms, for each Bill or important issue people would have access to accurate information and balanced argument via the SOL website. The SOL website would also include a pros &amp; cons section, expert opinion and analysis, the sitting senator's view, and a public forum. People would register, and after registering and being allocated a user name and password, would be able to cast a vote on each Bill or issue.

Most importantly, there would only be one vote per person on Australia's Commonwealth Electoral Roll. People will be able to change their vote.

When there is a clear majority view, this would then be the party view and would be represented in Parliament, enabling the voice of the majority to be heard over special interest groups.&quot;&quot;

of course this can easily be extended to initiative.

Paul

  Hey there,

  i've met with some of the people that occupy the space in front of the european central bank here in frankfurt/germany.
  They have WLAN and and Intranet now and they recently started to think about how to use this new connectivity for consensus building.
  I've met with them in order to help them with the organisation of workshops that try to discuss the current monetary system so that they might develop an alternative or at least get to know about alternatives that are already discussed elsewhere, like &quot;monetative.org&quot;.

  Currently they also experiment with the &quot;Liquid Feedback&quot; software, but i think votorola might be the better tool for their purpose.
  Is it possible to use votorola? I'll meet again with them this week and also i've already started to tell them about metagovernment.org and what it is and what we do and also about votorola, i could need more input.
  They have their own IT folks. They run their intranet and give technical support on any issue that might occur. Maybe I can convince some of them to join this mailinglist, but until then, i'd like to know if its possible for them to host and use votorola for their purpose.
