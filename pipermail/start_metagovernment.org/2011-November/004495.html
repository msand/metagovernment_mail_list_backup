<PRE>Hello everybody,

as promised, I shall try to present a video each week.

This time I am presenting a talk I gave at the recent ePart conference.
The video is here:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c</A>

The talk with the paper can be found here:
<A HREF="http://home.pietrosperoni.it/index.php/research/epart/2011epart/">http://home.pietrosperoni.it/index.php/research/epart/2011epart/</A>

What is the idea behind this talk.

A lot of services out there permit to vote on proposals (or comments,
or pages, ...). But it is not always clear what the vote represent. We
suggest that voting should be done on a 2D triangular structure. Where
people can express rapidly what how much do they understand the
proposal, and how much do they agree with it.

Then we discuss how doing this would give the service using this
system some really powerful tool to aggregate proposals, and to
automatically suggest which proposals should be rewritten (and who
should rewrite them).

So far the model is theoretical, but we are considering adding a
simplified version on Vilfredo. Simplified because the Pareto Front
does not play well with continuous valuation (it does work, it just
does not filter out enough proposals). But the idea is general, and
anyone else can also use it in their system.

Cheers,
Pietro

</PRE>
