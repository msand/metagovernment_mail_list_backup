<PRE>Dear JF,

Thanks very much for explaining.  I still want to tug at this single
party thread.  I think it indicates a deeper problem, which hopefully
is something we can redress (I think it is).

&gt;<i> That is the main difference with partisan parties, &quot;pure&quot; E2D
</I>&gt;<i> parties can't officially spit up in factions and they can't refuse
</I>&gt;<i> citizens holding varying political ideologies from participating ...
</I>
Right, but they can split on techical grounds.  So one uses Demoex,
another Liquid Feedback, and so on... lots of choices.

&gt;<i> It is best to understand an E2D party as not yet another political
</I>&gt;<i> party but rather as a virtual House of Commons or Legislature (one
</I>&gt;<i> in which an entire citizenry and all other political parties, big or
</I>&gt;<i> small, can sit in ...
</I>
Except that each E2D technology apparently needs its own E2D party?

&gt;<i> Hello Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the note, I hadn't seen it. I also don't know how to reply
</I>&gt;<i> directly to the previous post but here is my answer (see below) with
</I>&gt;<i> regards to your question:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&quot;I imagine that two E2D parties might compete in the same election.
</I>&gt;<i> Would they also *cooperate* in that case?  Or would each strive to
</I>&gt;<i> dominate its rivals like ordinary parties do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Network effects tend to reward big parties (and voting systems) at the
</I>&gt;<i> expense of smaller ones.  Unchecked by any opposing tendency, such as
</I>&gt;<i> the material interests that pull left and right, network effects will
</I>&gt;<i> always eliminate competition and lead to a monopoly.  A party might
</I>&gt;<i> even hope to establish a monopoly at the global level.  In any case,
</I>&gt;<i> what would prevent a one-party system from emerging in each country?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is an interesting, and timely, question as we are currently debating
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;requirements for becoming a member party of E2D International&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://e2d-international.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=185">http://e2d-international.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=185</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The short answer is, in my opinion, as with all political internationals,
</I>&gt;<i> that there can only be one member party at each jurisdiction level. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, there can only be one Green Party of Canada, or one Pirate Party
</I>&gt;<i> of Canada at the federal level, endorsed by and members of Global Greens
</I>&gt;<i> and Pirate Parties International, respectively; however, there can also be
</I>&gt;<i> Green Party of Ontario, Green Party of British Columbia, Nova Scotia, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It wouldn't make sense to endorse multiple E2D parties competing against
</I>&gt;<i> one another for votes in elections and 2) it would be a waste of resource
</I>&gt;<i> to run two or more parties with exactly the same goal at the same
</I>&gt;<i> jurisdiction because E2D parties by definition are non-partisan.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is the main difference with partisan parties, &quot;pure&quot; E2D parties can't
</I>&gt;<i> officially spit up in factions and they can't refuse citizens holding
</I>&gt;<i> varying political ideologies from participating (as opposed to, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, the Communist Party of Canada and the Marxist-Leninist Party of
</I>&gt;<i> Canada which can both co-exist at the federal level because members or
</I>&gt;<i> leaders at some point decided to adopt slightly different policies and
</I>&gt;<i> attract different people).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Read the E2D Manifesto: <A HREF="http://e2d-international.org/manifesto/">http://e2d-international.org/manifesto/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is best to understand an E2D party as not yet another political party
</I>&gt;<i> but rather as a virtual House of Commons or Legislature (one in which an
</I>&gt;<i> entire citizenry and all other political parties, big or small, can sit in
</I>&gt;<i> - as opposed to a limited number of elected representatives from only 4 of
</I>&gt;<i> the 19 political parties in Canada, for example). The building itself,
</I>&gt;<i> where people make decisions, is politically-neutral. The decisions that are
</I>&gt;<i> made within that building ARE themselves partisan but they change (or not)
</I>&gt;<i> as people change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this clears things up a little more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With regards to changing the political system to a one-party system, like
</I>&gt;<i> the Community Party of China or the Workers' Party of Korea (North), for
</I>&gt;<i> example; in the case of an E2D party, it can ONLY act according to the will
</I>&gt;<i> of the people. If the majority of Canadian citizens want to amend their
</I>&gt;<i> constitution (and go through the trouble of getting 7 out of 10 Premiers to
</I>&gt;<i> agree), in order to change the Canadian Constitution, for example, and
</I>&gt;<i> instate a one-party system, well, that would be their collective decision.
</I>&gt;<i> I personally don't see this happening (nor the point, given that we would
</I>&gt;<i> presumably already have a direct democracy if that decision was even
</I>&gt;<i> legally possible) but who knows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And there is no such thing as a world parliament or legislature (yet), with
</I>&gt;<i> candidates and parties and direct worldwide elections (EU level might be
</I>&gt;<i> the closest so far), so the fear that an E2D party might hope to establish
</I>&gt;<i> a monopoly at the global level is unfounded, for the moment (although I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure some &quot;traditional&quot; parties and elected leaders have already thought of
</I>&gt;<i> the idea ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -JF
