</I>&gt;<i> No a priori or adhoc structure to the membership (such as fixed

</I>&gt;<i> impose a top down power structure on the decision making process,  
</I>&gt;<i> and cause artificial separation between the general membership and  
</I>&gt;<i> the decisions of the network.
</I>&gt;<i> Full legal recognition of online voting, digital signatures,  
</I>&gt;<i> delegation and other means of voting where physical presence at  
</I>&gt;<i> meetings is not possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Flexibility - the ability to change the structure of the legal  
</I>&gt;<i> structure through a vote of them members, suing the system of their  
</I>&gt;<i> preference (ie the software) at a time and in a manner of their  
</I>&gt;<i> choosing, without artificial restriction based on regional law, or  
</I>&gt;<i> based on prohibitive cost (by requiring for instance legal advice to  
</I>&gt;<i> make such changes).
</I>&gt;<i> The ability to create a wide range of charitable, ethical, not-for- 
</I>&gt;<i> profit organisational structures - without restricting these to  
</I>&gt;<i> preconceived ideas of what constitutes &quot;charitable&quot; activity.
</I>&gt;<i> The ability to create nested and / or p2p organisational (legal)  
</I>&gt;<i> structures. This allows the membership to structure legally binding  
</I>&gt;<i> decision making in a distributed, local, or domain specific fashion,  
</I>&gt;<i> and not be forced into central and hierarchical structures.
</I>&gt;<i> Robust legal structures are possible, which allow the above. None of  
</I>&gt;<i> them are perfect yet, but some of them are sufficiently simple and  
</I>&gt;<i> flexible to allow us to create &quot;legal shells&quot; which embody our  
</I>&gt;<i> principles. It does however rule out structures like Vereins, or  
</I>&gt;<i> classic charity structures, as the legal hub so to speak, all though  
</I>&gt;<i> these can be incorporated as member organisations with specific  
</I>&gt;<i> national or anational roles. The overall legal architecture does not  
</I>&gt;<i> need to be complex, but should mirror / identify with the software  
</I>&gt;<i> architecture.
</I>
Yes, I think I am laying the groundwork for all of the above with the  
draft charter
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft1">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft1</A>

I am keeping it deliberately extremely simple at first so we can build  
consensus around the basics. We can flesh out the details once we have  
passed that first step. Please feel free to edit as appropriate.

What I still don't know is what existing legal structures we can look  
to to help us create a formally-recognized organization. You indicate  
that you are aware of some of these; can you please list some so I can  
research them? I will have limited availability for the next week, but  
I am very eager to explore this further to see if we can get this  
moving forward.

&gt;<i>  Clearly it is important to embody the mission charter in the  
</I>&gt;<i> constitutional structure. However what is important is how it is  
</I>&gt;<i> agreed / created and how it is changed. The &quot;change rules&quot; need to  
</I>&gt;<i> be according to the principles of the LD software and not some  
</I>&gt;<i> rigid / historically inherited / regional legal structure.
</I>
The rules that my draft links to were developed by using Votorola to  
create a decision-making algorithm for editing our own wiki with  
consensus. I think it is a good starting point for the basis of the  
organization as a whole, no?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. Concerning version control for policy-making, you are echoing  
</I>&gt;<i> the concepts first proposed on this list by Aur Saraf, who started  
</I>&gt;<i> building such a system. You may want to look at some of his  
</I>&gt;<i> writings, starting with:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000187.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000187.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> He hasn't been active on the list since he got pulled into the  
</I>&gt;<i> military, but I will cc him on this in case he's available to  
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate with you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes - that would be good. I read the above, and generally agree with  
</I>&gt;<i> it. It's the implementation that counts I guess - has there been any  
</I>&gt;<i> discussion of mobile and in particular mobile app creation?
</I>
Aur started developing the bare shell of the DVCS-based system, and  
then he got drafted. Nobody has picked up his work since them. I did  
contact Aur, and he is still around, but his military service  
precludes him from participating in the project. He may be free in,  
well, a couple of years. Hopefully we'll hear more from him then.

He had distributed his code:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000219.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000219.html</A>
but I think that server may be no longer presenting his work.
