But what if we have a formal organization which has received grant  
money? Who gets the power to determine how that money is spent? In a  
sense, I suppose you could say that the foundation which provides the  
grant has made a resource allocation to it, but that allocation may be  
rather broad, sometimes something as general as &quot;seed money&quot; to help  
the organization get off the ground. The details particular  
allocations will still have to be decided by people who do not need to  
input further resources to get it done.

This was my original idea back before the Metagovernment page was even  
editable. Here's the first web version, from early 2007:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/archive/2007-03-20/">http://www.metagovernment.org/archive/2007-03-20/</A>
(See the third-to-last paragraph.)

That gets the job done, but I was quickly turned from that idea by  
others: do we really want to start out our formal organization by  
violating our core principle?

Perhaps more to the point, the purpose of a board of directors, in the  
view of sanctioning governments and granting foundations, is to  
provide accountability and management so that they know the  
organization will act responsibly. Having a powerless board does not  
provide those guarantees. Instead, we need to find a way to provide  
those guarantees without having any board. That's our purpose anyway.  
This is our test to see if we are actually able to eat our own dogfood.

Is this encoded in software, or do you manually have to check the edit  
count of each participant? Clearly, if we want to scale, we need  
something which has at least some automation to it.

Also, counting edits for a wiki makes a lot of sense, but what counts  
for us? So far, the rule we have used in small-scale decisions has  
been participation on this list in the previous month.
