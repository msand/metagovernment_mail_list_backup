<PRE>Thanks for sharing this, Alex.

I would recommend they *use* it.  No serious e-dem system is ready for
beta users.  We want to work with them to *develop* the technology,
which means alpha users and developers. (sigh) Mostly only developers
will understand the difference.

&gt;<i> Another thing is, that they are not sure how to go about voter
</I>&gt;<i> registration. They want it to be anonym but they also want people to
</I>&gt;<i> register at a camp and they see the risk of people creating sock
</I>&gt;<i> puppets.
</I>
All of these OIVS posts are related to that:

&gt;<i> Next, they also need to integrated the GENERAL ASSEMBLEY into the
</I>&gt;<i> plattform. Maybe there is a way to generate personal QR codes using
</I>&gt;<i> openpgp or something and enable people to vote through cell phones

</I>&gt;<i> another token? any idea how to integrate the general assembley?

There are many discussions of online GA in NYC GA forums and the Anglo
tech lists.  Most of these forum posts concern online assemblies of
some sort, for instance:

I see no need to wire up the GA.  What we need is an online primary
legislative system to prepare stuff for the assemblies to pass.  The
primaries are where the real control is.  I'm currently trying to find
compadres to work on that, cross-project style:
<A HREF="https://lists.takethesquare.net/pipermail/occupy-dev/2011-November/thread.html#86">https://lists.takethesquare.net/pipermail/occupy-dev/2011-November/thread.html#86</A>

&gt;<i> many people who participate in the general assembley like their
</I>&gt;<i> privacy or anonymity ...
</I>
To be sure, the GA is a public assembly.  They cannot have privacy
unless they wear hoods or masks.

&gt;<i> They also would like to evaluate more tools and asked me for
</I>&gt;<i> powerpoints and videos that describe the tools that are already out
</I>&gt;<i> there and ready to use.  Everybody on this list, if you read this
</I>&gt;<i> and are associated with a tool that could be used and have videos,
</I>&gt;<i> powerpoint slides or similar material to give a short presentation,
</I>&gt;<i> send it to me :-) ...or give me links ;)
</I>
All I can offer is my reply here, which points to a big list:
<A HREF="https://lists.takethesquare.net/pipermail/occupy-dev/2011-November/000109.html">https://lists.takethesquare.net/pipermail/occupy-dev/2011-November/000109.html</A>

&gt;<i> Occupy Frankfurt told me that OWS uses bettermeans. Is that true? U
</I>&gt;<i> recently mentioned u've talked to them.
</I>
I have no firm contacts on the ground in NY, yet.  All my info comes
from forums and lists.  I never heard that anyone's using Bettermeans.
I know that OpenAssembly is marketing itself and has supporters in NYC
and Chicago, but I don't think NYC is using any voting tools, yet.

&gt;<i> I think they liked the idea of cross mirroring votes :-)
</I>
That's where I'm putting most of my own effort.  If you find anyone
who wants to help (either politically or technically), please send
them my way.  Here's my latest request for help (bottom):

(I'm just winging it; I really have no idea how to go about this.)
