<PRE>Welcome Stephen,

Your thoughts on the future remind me of how I got started working in
participatory democracy.  I was experimenting with collaborative
writing tools that had a range of applications from creative writing
to law making.  The one I liked best was utopian literature.
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/textbender/d/overview.xht#Utopian-Literature">http://zelea.com/project/textbender/d/overview.xht#Utopian-Literature</A>

One day, I was discussing the technology with a business consultant
and explaining the utopian literary app.  He shook his head and
suggested I look at the political apps.  Instantly I knew he was
right.  So I started thinking about voting media.  Not long after
though, I realized that the utopian app would also depend on voting.

Those rough notes are almost impossible to read.  But there's stuff in
there (or in my confused head) that's similar to what you're thinking
of - what to call it? - a consciously self-steering culture.  Speaking
for myself, this is still my favourite application. :-)

&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i> OK...I'm not a developer. I probably shouldn't even be on this list....but I have thought a lot about the scalability of collaborative systems. It seems to me that the issue of trust enters the picture only when you are trying to ascribe *votes* to *individuals...or groups* who cast them towards the development of some kind of *legislation...or representation*. I see the validity of the effort given that our current systems operate this way. Though it seems to me the real potential of the systems you all are developing is in a more informal and creative approach to building a DIFFERENT world. I imagine this must sound vague, simplistic and idealistic (because it is)....but please let me explain. 
</I>&gt;<i> In my mind what is currently taking place around the world is the emergence of a new ordering of our social or cultural infrastructure. It's bigger than any existing system of control or governance, transcends all boundaries, and has at it's core the ability to self-organize.  We-are-part-of-this and can influence it greatly (I believe)...but only by moving away from the older structures of polarity and separation, (us and them, right and left, mine and yours).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If (or when) we begin moving like starlings, in *murmuration* with each other (I love that word), the issue of trust shifts to the whole, and scalability can then be an organic ordering or grouping driven by intuition and attraction. Deliberation is minimal....orientation is holistic....beauty and celebration are always immanent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think developing tools for eDemocracy maybe putting new wine into old skins.....a very worthy effort, but I question if that is where we are really headed. As a self-aware, self-organizing emerging consciousness, I believe *we* are becoming less about ordering the polarity, than about trusting (and perhaps, to some degree, leveraging) the chaos. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The question for me is what is the minimal structure/process necessary to *seed* an emerging global organism of creative, self-organizing evolution......online.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK....I've probably just shat all over myself. You've probably already been down (or avoided) this road many times. I love what you all are doing. I wish I was a geek like you so I could join in all the fun.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks so much for your efforts...
</I>&gt;<i> Steve
