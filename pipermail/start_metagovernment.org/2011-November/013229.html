<PRE>Hi Ed,

I would happily make an admin of the facebook page, but do you have a
facebook account at all?

Can you friend me, or join the metagov page?

Regarding me being an admin for the youtube page. Do you need me to be an
admin? Being the main contributor so far, maybe it is better if I am NOT an
administrator. In this way no one feels the youtube page risks becoming too
personalized along my line of research.

It's probably better that we make this general. Who is producing videos
should not be the person administering them. Or something similar.

Regarding starting Vilfredo again, we are on our way to launch a separate
tool. And once this is done, I would like to recover Vilfredo, fix the UI
and revamp it. RIght now it's quite a mess. I had no time to follow it
thoroughly. But I do remember there was a time where we had multiple
questions running at the same time. So I have seen it working.

Cheers,
Pietro
