I don't like the idea of aggregated general trust scores.

I'm very much interested in new and alternative views in science,
technology, society and philosophy.

I do want to filter up high quality. But I don't want to leave it to
general consensus of what constitutes truth or quality. At the same
time; I don't want to reinforce personal reality bubbles.

A selection should first be on topic. If no matches is found, the topic
could be generalized to find more matches. Secondly; If you have lots of
matches, it should include those of your most trusted sources.

But in interest of broading the views, each &quot;search result&quot; should
always include items that's not among your known sources. Those items
should be a mix of a) completely random picks from the availible search
results. b) items from your broader circle including your friends
advisors and your advisors advisors. c) the &quot;high quality&quot; advisors for
the current topic. d) new items. e) items that has not yet recieved any
reaction.

This will result in more exposure for generally more trusted sources.
But not in a way that dominates. I really want to promote new ideas.

Some algoritms detect trends in approval and promotes those. That will
give exposure to new items or new advisors. But that is still mainly a
measure of popularity. Controversial ideas could easily get left out. We
want to find the things that a small number of people finds interesting
even if it is things that a large number of people categorize as rubbish.

That can partly be done by clustering sources and selecting sources from
clusters you already trust.
