<PRE>Oh nice :-) I didn't know. You could have mentioned it.
I couldn't find it and i still cannot find it through facebook's search box.
...it seems to be a group. It's not possible to &quot;LIKE&quot; groups, that means
it's not possible to &quot;FOLLOW&quot; it and receive any news nor is it easy to
&quot;share&quot; information about it.

I've seen the video created by Pietro Speroni di
Fenizio&lt;<A HREF="http://www.facebook.com/pietrosperoni">http://www.facebook.com/pietrosperoni</A>&gt;and i really loved it.
So I decided to LIKE it and to SHARE it on my
personal Facebook Page.
...but now my friends will see the video on my &quot;Facebook Wall&quot; and could
also watch it directly on YouTube, but they wont see that i got it from
Pietro.
They also wont see that it was originally be posted in the Metagovernment
Group.
That's why I think a group is the wrong direction.
A Facebook Group is more like a closed concept, while something that you
could &quot;like&quot; is more open.

I suggest to change that, so the next time i share a video from
metagovernment will advertise metagovernment and not only the shared
content.
