<PRE>You ask,
&quot;do we really want to start out our formal organization by violating our
core principle&quot;
not sure if it is a good core principle if it does't work in practice.
How about this principle, &quot;all things exist but not equally&quot;? Both
sub-atomic particles and solar systems exist but not equally.Why introduce
a principle of equality when in reality all there are are singularities?
