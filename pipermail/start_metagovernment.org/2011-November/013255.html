<PRE>&gt;<i> Perhaps more to the point, the purpose of a board of directors, in the
</I>view of sanctioning governments and granting foundations, is to provide
accountability and management so that they know the
&gt;<i> organization will act responsibly. Having a powerless board does not
</I>provide those guarantees. Instead, we need to find a way to provide those
guarantees without having any board. That's our purpose
&gt;<i> anyway. This is our test to see if we are actually able to eat our own
</I>dogfood.

Yes :-) Eat our own dogfood is the way to move forward. Thus, all the
discussion currently done through the mailing list should be integrated
into a metagovernment system.

&gt;<i> &quot;do we really want to start out our formal organization by violating our
</I>core principle&quot;
&gt;<i> not sure if it is a good core principle if it does't work in practice.
</I>&gt;<i> How about this principle, &quot;all things exist but not equally&quot;? Both
</I>sub-atomic particles and solar systems exist but not equally
&gt;<i> Why introduce a principle of equality when in reality all there are are
</I>singularities?

I think the most natural way would be to give executive power to single
beeing through voting of the community to get a job done or to serve the
community in one way or another.
If the community is not satisfied with the person in power, it can
immediately remove the power from that person.
In Europe, nearly all forms of formal organizations explicitely limit the
amount of chairmen, but for metagovernment it should in theory be possible
to have no chairman at all or to make everyone a chairman at the &quot;board of
directors&quot;. In reality these two extremes will never happen.

So at any time, there might be several elected executive chairmen with
limited rights. The kind of chairmens a community allows could be modeled
through roles that could be processed by the metagovernment system and then
voted for so that it becomes an agreed upon role. Such roles could then be
used by issues/rules/laws that are discussed and voted for and after it
became effective, maybe after it passed W=3weeks &amp; T=&quot;a lot of people&quot; ;)
...the community could vote for a person that would fill the role that was
incorporated into that issue.

So the board of directors, each member with limited executive rights
depending on his role, will change dynamically and might be held
responsible by outsiders for metagovernments actions, but the community
could incoporate several guarantees into the role a board member fills,
thus if the board member is held accountable for his actions or
metagovernment actions, the metagovernment community has to compensate him.

So my english is far from perfect and i hope what i've written is
comprehensible :-)
