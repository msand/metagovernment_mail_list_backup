<PRE>The idea of a system to represent and facilitate trust networks is central to many types of applications, and is really a field of its own, for example with credit ratings agencies who maintain information with respect to financial trustworthiness, and trust (feedback) scores that people build on sites like ebay and other exchange/trading/sharing apps.&#160; But those are only limited examples, and yes, a proper open system maybe could be built which could extend a trust system along other dimensions.&#160; However,&#160; financial trust is one thing, but just because you trust someone to borrow something or to provide a good quality product or service does not mean you would trust their judgement with respect to more complex decisions.&#160; So the issue is that in more abstract, complex areas, trust is much more complex and varies much more from one type of issue to another. Therefore I do not think it is possible to decouple the trust network from the issues -
 particularly if an issue is not just purely financial, but involves subjective / moral, philosophical, religious, or ethical questions.&#160; Therefore I think that the trust component has to remain coupled with specific issues.

So for example if an issue is presented on whether to allocate some public resources for a certain public works project, let various groups present their proposals, and opinions of those, and then let the voters either vote on one or more of the proposals, or, if the voter prefers, let them delegate their vote(s) to other(s) who they trust to make the decision for them.

And as a second example let's say a vote is to be held for a public office, so let the candidates present their platforms, and then let the voters 
either vote for/against one or more candidates, or, let them 
delegate their vote(s) to other(s) who they trust to make the decision 
for them. 

In both examples, probably the voters will look at both issues differently and maybe not delegate their votes the same way.

</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for the replies Paul and Jonas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There are some similarities to liquid democracy, particularly the idea of delegation. However, liquid democracy is still geared towards voting on issues in order to make decisions. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm proposing we take a step back from decision-making in order to build a trust network that is purely and simply a resource - a measure of trust in distinct areas that people can draw upon as they see fit. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>An application of this resource in democracy would be to give the most trusted users a prominent voice in debate in their specialist fields. But it has a whole range of other social and economic applications: finding a trustworthy babysitter, maintaining a high trust score as an asset on your CV, expressing your distrust of a business that causes social harms...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So it's about empowering people, encouraging responsible actions and nurturing the right conditions for better democracy.
