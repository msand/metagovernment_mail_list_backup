<PRE>@ Alex

my two points about anonymity and rusting of votes I made in my post 
before apply here too, right?

&gt;<i> B. What about a mechanism, that will freeze one's voice with an
</I>&gt;<i> accepted proposal, i mean:
</I>&gt;<i> The anonymous author of a proposal is not allowed to shift the votes
</I>&gt;<i> as soon as a proposal becomes &quot;active law&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> ...votes will stick with that &quot;active law&quot; as long as its active.
</I>
I don't understand what that would be good for. It would only force the 
voters to start a new poll about the same subject, right?

&gt;<i> - if it was a project that gets executed, the votes vanish after the
</I>&gt;<i> project has been executed.
</I>
Well yes. Such a poll somehow simply dries out, it dies.

Best Regards,
Thomas
