At this time, I prefer to be freindless on Facebook (well, I had to  
add one for administrative reasons). I have liked the Metagov page, so  
you should now be able to make me an admin by clicking on the &quot;like  
this&quot; link under the number of fans.

I agree with Alex that a page makes more sense than a group. A group  
is internal to Facebook only, and thereby not &quot;open&quot; as the rest of  
our tools. If we want a Facebook presence, I would suggest we post on  
the group that the presence has moved to the Page, and invite people  
to come over.

&gt;<i> It's probably better that we make this general. Who is producing  
</I>&gt;<i> videos should not be the person administering them. Or something  
</I>&gt;<i> similar.
</I>
Well, at the moment, the only movie there was made by me (and it's  
rather silly). But hopefully we can progress with the script in  
development and make a true collaborative project to put up there.

&gt;<i> Regarding starting Vilfredo again, we are on our way to launch a

</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo, fix the UI and revamp it. RIght now it's quite a mess. I

</I>&gt;<i> time where we had multiple questions running at the same time. So I  
</I>&gt;<i> have seen it working.
</I>
Please keep the list informed. Even if you just need input on the  
development, I think some people here would be glad to have something  
they can contribute to.
