<PRE>Hi Thomas,
thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Pietro,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now you gave me two links:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G!p!m00">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G!p!m00</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Now the second is the leading solution. Ok. Now, so that I learn better
</I>&gt;<i> to use Votorola, how do I go from the first link to the second?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, you click on the little dot in front of the name and on the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> page you click on the draft pointer link.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What????? the most important link from a page and you hide it in this way?
Com'on!
Please look at ifttt.com for an example of how to make things absolutely
OBVIOUS (as they should be).


&gt;<i> For the other voters and their positions it is the same. To browse through
</I>&gt;<i> the vote-tree, click on the candidates names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ok, thanks.


&gt;<i>  Also, can I just write my own draft version and vote for it? I have read
</I>&gt;<i> yours and I am not sure I understand, and even less that I agree with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think it would be good, if you would write your own draft version
</I>&gt;<i> in the Metagov-Wiki, so we can compare our versions, maybe merge parts of
</I>&gt;<i> it etc..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok, I will work on it.


&gt;<i> With Votorola you can not vote for your own draft. I guess we figure, that
</I>&gt;<i> it is clear enough that you are in favour of your own version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, but is my non vote counted? I mean, if there are 10 people, and 7, has
each their version, and 4 vote for the same one by one of them.
is the result 4,1,1,1,1,1,1 (so the proposal voted by 4 has a relative
majority)
or 4 (so the proposal voted by 4 has the consensus).
It looks like an important difference.


&gt;<i> Though I myself would also like to express that explicitly with a vote for
</I>&gt;<i> myself, hm ... But you can ofc collect votes for your draft. If I like
</I>&gt;<i> yours, I vote for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>ok, I'll do my best.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Also, it looks like you guys have made some cool hacks on the left. But
</I>&gt;<i> I don't fully understand them. Forgive them, you probably have explained
</I>&gt;<i> them hundreds of time. What I see is that it says, Ed Mi and if I hover
</I>&gt;<i> over Ed, some part of the page get greyed, if not some other part of the
</I>&gt;<i> page. Does this refer to who made what changes? Or to what do people
</I>&gt;<i> support?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It shows the parts which differ between Eds draft and mine for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Done

&gt;<i> Click on Ed to fix this view and then click on the symbol &quot;)(&quot; of a
</I>&gt;<i> specific difference and it leads you to the difference-bridge (as we call
</I>&gt;<i> it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Done and received:
The page at zelea.com:8080 says:
Malformed tokelet specification: _1.1

Still it seems to work.


&gt;<i> There I can pull Eds suggestions into my draft, if I like them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ok.
</I>
Do we have any person who is studying design and usability on the list? I
think both Votorola and Vilfredo might use your help ;-).

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, i did not miss it, but i also did not vote for it as you can see in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the vote tree. (For i wasnt really convinced but i also found it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complicated to vote for it, but thats just an interface issues ;-) )
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was discussing it with Pietro, because i feel the rule as it is now is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> far from perfect. To me it just does not feel natural. The concept behind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> votorola feels very natural, but not the ruleset (W,T,P) as it is now. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remember talking to you about the number of people that vote for a rule
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will increase or decrease the time needed for the rule to become effective.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (similar to what Ed Pastore said about Aktiv Demokrati)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From the perspective of a single voter, the question about &quot;waiting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> periods&quot; is somehow tied to his personal &quot;news system&quot;...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A single voter in a global world wants to know about all the rules that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might change soon and that will affect him personally in one way or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another., BUT: he doesnt want to spend all of his time searching or looking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for rules that might change an affect him in a negative way...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If &quot;Waiting Period W&quot; is just set to the arbitrary value of &quot;3 Weeks&quot; or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;1 week&quot;, that seems to be oversimplified.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It should depend on the people involved and it should depend on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> importance of the issue/rule/law that is proposed, thus the importance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should somehow affect if information about it pops up in a voters &quot;news
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inbox&quot; or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The questions are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Why do we need waiting time's at all? (On which factors should the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> waiting time depend?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Why do we need concencus at all? (Do we need concencus of all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voters to set a standard for noise control or the requirement to wear a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> helmet in power plants?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
