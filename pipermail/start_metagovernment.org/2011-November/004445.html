<PRE>As we are discussing ways to govern ourselves, there is something I would
like to add.
But I'll do it in another thread.

In a sense we are trying to define some rules that should govern ourselves.

But this brings two questions. (1) how are those rules decided and (2) how
can those rules change.

How are those rules decided is generally the center stage of our
discussion. How to decide.

But now I would like to suggest something about the number 2.

My idea is that every rule should have a time t. The time that is needed to
change the rule. More basic rules will have longer times, less important
rules will have shorter times.

The idea is that anyone can, in any moment, propose a change in a rule.
If no one protests after t time has passed, the proposed change is
automatically accepted.

If instead someone protest, than we use one of our tool to settle the
discussion. While the discussion is going on, the old rule still applies.
Once the discussion is settled, it will still not be valid the new rule
until a time of t is passed. If anyone in this time t is not happy with the
result he can open everything again. And still the old rule applies.

This will make quite hard to change the rule. But it also gives stability.
You know what the rules are, and you know you can go on vacation for t-1
days and you know when you come back you are still going to find the same
rules.

The time t should be specified in every rule, but when it is not specified
it can be defined as (I don't know, 1 month?). Changing the length of t for
a certain rule, counts as a change.
I would take what I described above as a rule (rule can speak about other
rules), but with a very long t (something between 3 months and 1 year).


I have been using a similar system before with great success. But this is
the first time I describe it in public.
Yet it is quite similar to the way constitutions works.

Cheers,
Pietro
