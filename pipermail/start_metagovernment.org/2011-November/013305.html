<PRE>Hi Thomas,
thanks for hearing the talk, thanks for taking the time.

Let me see if I can answer your question.

Indeed Scalability is the key problem, and a lot of this will only be
solved when we start with some example. For example, the idea of
clustering proposal, is really nice, but the clusters will probably
not be all of the same size. With all sort of problems regarding the
too small clusters and the too big ones. Still they can be solved. But
probably we will not ba able to apply the same solution everywhere.

Indeed if the solution was about a single number I would NOT call this
an open question, but something between an open and a closed question.

But the fact is that even when you are deciding questions that have to
do with a number, it is possible that more complex solution come out.
This has happened in Vilfredo, where the community has come out with a
solution that was obviously not considered by the person asking the
question.

And then there is another issue, even questions that are &quot;only a
number&quot; often hide the complexity inside. For example some people
might be willing to pay a certain tax rate, if then the services they
receive are of a certain kind. In Italy many people protest for higher
taxes, but they often claim, the problem is to pay so high taxes and
then receive such little services from the government. The recent
prime minister, Monti, explained that we will now have to make some
sacrifices, but it will be presented in packages that touch everybody,
so no one will feel an economic maneuver is just against them.

Regarding the idea of using a Votorola like system, that is a proxy
voting, I think this is not really acceptable.
First of all a problem with proxy voting is that people give support
to someone, then they forget, and that person remains with an
inherited power. This is very dangerous. Look how now in
Metagovernment you have 5 votes that you can move as you want. Yes,
people can take them away from you, but some of those people are not
active anymore, and many simply do not care. They will vote for
someone because they trust him. Because he is a cool guy, or because
he is an actor. Sorry, I do not think this is ok.

Also an important principle that I am following is a principle of Fair
participation, which require that proposals are all evaluated only by
the content. This means that people enter this system without knowing
who else is there. They do not know the others. They can be their best
friends or their worse enemies. They only read what those people
propose, or comment. If you take away this principle you are inserting
in the system all sort of social dynamic that da facto make it harder
for people to evaluate things because of their content.

Indeed every voter has the right to participate to both a clarity
working group and a compromise working group. But, as you pointed out,
it is probably unfeasible if the groups are too big, in which case
some groups can be split, and have two groups work in parallel on the
same cluster.

Also remember that work groups usually require extra effort.
Although everybody is welcome to participate, on average less than
everybody will participate in the workgroups.

Have you seen the two taks I gave on Fair Participation and on  System
Generated Requests for Rewriting Proposals
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Ty-E9xlDA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Ty-E9xlDA</A>
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c</A>

The first will clarify better the concept of fair participation (I am
now preparing another presentation on this),
and the second on the actual procedure to evaluate proposals. If this
system is utilized we could even have a system that invites people to
rewrite proposals based on how well are they able to explain a
position..

Best Regards,
Pietro

P.S. you mention the system of groups within groups that is present in
Votorola. I am not sure I believe that will actually work. I mean, yes
you can have a fractal system o split groups, into smaller and smaller
units. But then I am not sure you can so easily come back and
aggregate proposals in the bigger groups. There is something about the
whole process that leave me uneasy. Not in the way people divide into
groups, but in the way arguments should then merge together. Sorry if
I can't be more specific.

&gt;<i> Hello Pietro,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After watching your video: I like, that you adress the problem of
</I>&gt;<i> scalability. IMO this is *THE* problem of e-democracy. And as you know, in
</I>&gt;<i> political science it is the main argument for representative democracy and
</I>&gt;<i> against direct democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And as you point out, the solution has to be some sort of distillation
</I>&gt;<i> process where huge amounts of proposals get fused into a few.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pleasse correct me, if I'm wrong with the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You suggest a four-stage-process: 1. many single proposals --&gt; 2. a few
</I>&gt;<i> clusters of proposals --&gt; 3. a few proposals --&gt; 4. very few final proposals
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From 1. to 2. this is done by some math-algorithm. I suspect, this has
</I>&gt;<i> immanent limitations. E.g. if the proposals only differ in a single number
</I>&gt;<i> (lets say a proposed tax-rate). If you have every number between 0 and 50,
</I>&gt;<i> how can you cluster them? Why not let the voters themselves decide to come
</I>&gt;<i> together and form clusters ... like in Votorola?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From 2. to 3. (minute 17.00 in the youtube-video) this is done by the
</I>&gt;<i> clarity working groups. Has every voter the right to be in one of the
</I>&gt;<i> groups? For reasons of fairness, I guess yes. And the same from 3. to 4.
</I>&gt;<i> everybody should be allowed to be in one of the integration working groups.
</I>&gt;<i> But then the question comes up: how can thousands of voters in such a group
</I>&gt;<i> come up with a consensus? I mean, this is the question we were all up to
</I>&gt;<i> answer in the first place. ... In Votorola the clustering can happen in as
</I>&gt;<i> many levels of depth as necesarry. This way all of the voters end up in
</I>&gt;<i> self-chosen small groups of 5 to 15 members. A size, where people can still
</I>&gt;<i> talk to each other and also listen. I guess more than 20 is to many.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas
