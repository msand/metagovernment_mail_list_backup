<PRE>Thanks again for sharing, Alex.  So a working group in Frankfurt is
now endorsing Adhocracy, but no decision is yet ratified by the
general assembly?

Of course, I still hope we get all the assemblies to ratify a policy
of *non-endorsement*, and instead underwrite a mirroring network.

&gt;<i> I'm in contact with a person from spain and he told me they run a
</I>&gt;<i> system, called N-1 that is already beeing used by 7 different
</I>&gt;<i> assambleas, ... <A HREF="https://n-1.cc/pg/groups/586698/iccvpb-help/">https://n-1.cc/pg/groups/586698/iccvpb-help/</A>
</I>
I cannot figure out what N-1 is.  It may be connected with Lorea (?),
which is something of a mystery itself.

&gt;<i> ... and he would like to join the cause. Therefore, a method to
</I>&gt;<i> synchronize adhocracy with N-1 ... by vote mirroring might be very
</I>&gt;<i> welcome.
</I>
The developers of the two projects would have to design the vote
translations.  Friedrich Lindenberg wasn't keen on mirroring last we
checked, but that was a couple years ago.
