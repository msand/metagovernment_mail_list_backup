<PRE>Hi all,

Sorry I've been inactive on here lately. I've been thinking about a
different approach to the problem we're trying to solve (inadequate
governance).

I don't wish to detract from all the good work going on at Metagovernment,
but I would appreciate it if you could spend a few minutes considering a
different kind of idea and offering some feedback.

Unlike the ideas being developed here, what I'm proposing is not a tool to
enable people to make *decisions*. Instead, it is a tool that will show how
much people *trust *each other, both generally and in specific subject
areas. I believe that this resource, which I'm provisionally calling a
Trust Network, would enable communities to govern themselves far better -
essentially by giving a more prominent voice to the most trusted people in
various subject areas.

I've outlined the idea - which is still at the drawing board stage - in the
google document linked below.

<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Frra4RbLDeFs2mEI9_c8KvmTVvMWq0hqNgx90h5ZCI/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Frra4RbLDeFs2mEI9_c8KvmTVvMWq0hqNgx90h5ZCI/edit</A>

Any feedback would be very welcome, including pointers to existing projects
that have similar goals (one I've found so far is called &quot;espra trustmap&quot;).

Best,
Paul
