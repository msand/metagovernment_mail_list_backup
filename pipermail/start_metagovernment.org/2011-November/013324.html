<PRE>Hello Michael,

Thanks for the note, I hadn't seen it. I also don't know how to reply
directly to the previous post but here is my answer (see below) with
regards to your question:

&gt;<i>&quot;I imagine that two E2D parties might compete in the same election.
</I>Would they also *cooperate* in that case?  Or would each strive to
dominate its rivals like ordinary parties do?

Network effects tend to reward big parties (and voting systems) at the
expense of smaller ones.  Unchecked by any opposing tendency, such as
the material interests that pull left and right, network effects will
always eliminate competition and lead to a monopoly.  A party might
even hope to establish a monopoly at the global level.  In any case,
what would prevent a one-party system from emerging in each country?&quot;


This is an interesting, and timely, question as we are currently debating
the &quot;requirements for becoming a member party of E2D International&quot;:
<A HREF="http://e2d-international.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=185">http://e2d-international.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=185</A>

The short answer is, in my opinion, as with all political internationals,
that there can only be one member party at each jurisdiction level. For
example, there can only be one Green Party of Canada, or one Pirate Party
of Canada at the federal level, endorsed by and members of Global Greens
and Pirate Parties International, respectively; however, there can also be
Green Party of Ontario, Green Party of British Columbia, Nova Scotia, etc.

1) It wouldn't make sense to endorse multiple E2D parties competing against
one another for votes in elections and 2) it would be a waste of resource
to run two or more parties with exactly the same goal at the same
jurisdiction because E2D parties by definition are non-partisan.

That is the main difference with partisan parties, &quot;pure&quot; E2D parties can't
officially spit up in factions and they can't refuse citizens holding
varying political ideologies from participating (as opposed to, for
example, the Communist Party of Canada and the Marxist-Leninist Party of
Canada which can both co-exist at the federal level because members or
leaders at some point decided to adopt slightly different policies and
attract different people).

Read the E2D Manifesto: <A HREF="http://e2d-international.org/manifesto/">http://e2d-international.org/manifesto/</A>

It is best to understand an E2D party as not yet another political party
but rather as a virtual House of Commons or Legislature (one in which an
entire citizenry and all other political parties, big or small, can sit in
- as opposed to a limited number of elected representatives from only 4 of
the 19 political parties in Canada, for example). The building itself,
where people make decisions, is politically-neutral. The decisions that are
made within that building ARE themselves partisan but they change (or not)
as people change.

Hope this clears things up a little more.

With regards to changing the political system to a one-party system, like
the Community Party of China or the Workers' Party of Korea (North), for
example; in the case of an E2D party, it can ONLY act according to the will
of the people. If the majority of Canadian citizens want to amend their
constitution (and go through the trouble of getting 7 out of 10 Premiers to
agree), in order to change the Canadian Constitution, for example, and
instate a one-party system, well, that would be their collective decision.
I personally don't see this happening (nor the point, given that we would
presumably already have a direct democracy if that decision was even
legally possible) but who knows.

And there is no such thing as a world parliament or legislature (yet), with
candidates and parties and direct worldwide elections (EU level might be
the closest so far), so the fear that an E2D party might hope to establish
a monopoly at the global level is unfounded, for the moment (although I'm
sure some &quot;traditional&quot; parties and elected leaders have already thought of
the idea ;)
