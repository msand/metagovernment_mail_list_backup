I have been on the demonstration there two weeks ago and also been at the 
camp. I could come there as well, if the date is set right, as I am atm. 
occupied by my studies. (I live in Mannheim.) I think that this will be the 
easiest. Can you specify what they already told you about their needs? Do they 
want to transfer the general assembly to the web or help spread the word? 
Maybe we can prepare better that way and already set up Votorola for an 
example demonstration.
