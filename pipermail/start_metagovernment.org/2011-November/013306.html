<PRE>Wow, this is a very interesting discussion between you :-)

I have a feeling, that right now, votorola is the best system concept we have.
On the other hand, i totally agree with pietro about:
1. principle of Fair participation
2. problem of proxy voting (that people give support to someone, then
they forget, and that person remains with an inherited power.)

Maybe votorola could evolve a bit, like:
A. Would it be possible to create proposals and discuss them, but
until you give ur voice for a proposal u can be anonymous?
(the creator of the proposal could always stay anonymous)
=&gt; This might solve the issue with &quot;fair participation principle&quot;

B. What about a mechanism, that will freeze one's voice with an
accepted proposal, i mean:
The anonymous author of a proposal is not allowed to shift the votes
as soon as a proposal becomes &quot;active law&quot;.
...votes will stick with that &quot;active law&quot; as long as its active.
- if it was a project that gets executed, the votes vanish after the
project has been executed.
- if it was a something like &quot;The dignity of men is unimpeachable.&quot;
the vote stays with it until one die's?
...so that means children that are born should &quot;replenish&quot; this core
constitutional principle, as soon as they get the right to vote.

What do you think?
