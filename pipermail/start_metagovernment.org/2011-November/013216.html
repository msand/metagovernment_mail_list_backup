<PRE>Briefly...

In order to embed the principles discussed on this list (and being applied
to the development of softwares), into a legal constitution, such that
there is no or as little conflict as possible between the running of the
administrative system (ie the voting software), and the legal governance,
we need to choose a legal structure that allows:

   1. Full legal membership from individuals anywhere in the world.
   2. Zero administrative cost for adding and deleting members (including
   zero requirement for legal advice / costs). This would hinder extending
   membership to large numbers of people, and or members unwilling or unable
   to pay for full legal participation.
   3. No a priori or adhoc structure to the membership (such as fixed
   number and classification of a board of directors). This would impose a top
   down power structure on the decision making process, and cause artificial
   separation between the general membership and the decisions of the network.
   4. Full legal recognition of online voting, digital signatures,
   delegation and other means of voting where physical presence at meetings is
   not possible.
   5. Flexibility - the ability to change the structure of the legal
   structure through a vote of them members, suing the system of their
   preference (ie the software) at a time and in a manner of their choosing,
   without artificial restriction based on regional law, or based on
   prohibitive cost (by requiring for instance legal advice to make such
   changes).
   6. The ability to create a wide range of charitable, ethical,
   not-for-profit organisational structures - without restricting these to
   preconceived ideas of what constitutes &quot;charitable&quot; activity.
   7. The ability to create nested and / or p2p organisational (legal)
   structures. This allows the membership to structure legally binding
   decision making in a distributed, local, or domain specific fashion, and
   not be forced into central and hierarchical structures.

Robust legal structures are possible, which allow the above. None of them
are perfect yet, but some of them are sufficiently simple and flexible to
allow us to create &quot;legal shells&quot; which embody our principles. It does
however rule out structures like Vereins, or classic charity structures, as
the legal hub so to speak, all though these can be incorporated as member
organisations with specific national or anational roles. The overall legal
architecture does not need to be complex, but should mirror / identify with
the software architecture.


&gt;<i> Some of our earlier research on the topic is documented here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Organization">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Organization</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but that is rather out of date. Please do follow-up as soon as you can.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
 Will do...

Concerning embedding principles, are you suggesting that integrating the
&gt;<i> mission into the charter will prevent co-option? How about something like
</I>&gt;<i> this?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft1">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft1</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
 Clearly it is important to embody the mission charter in the
constitutional structure. However what is important is how it is agreed /
created and how it is changed. The &quot;change rules&quot; need to be according to
the principles of the LD software and not some rigid / historically
inherited / regional legal structure.

P.S. Concerning version control for policy-making, you are echoing the
&gt;<i> concepts first proposed on this list by Aur Saraf, who started building
</I>&gt;<i> such a system. You may want to look at some of his writings, starting with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000187.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-May/000187.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> He hasn't been active on the list since he got pulled into the military,
</I>&gt;<i> but I will cc him on this in case he's available to coordinate with you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes - that would be good. I read the above, and generally agree with it.
It's the implementation that counts I guess - has there been any discussion
of mobile and in particular mobile app creation?
