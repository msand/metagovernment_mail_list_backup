&gt;<i> (2) Has anyone actually implmented &quot;rusting votes&quot; Thomas?  It sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like a good solution.
</I>
I know of no implementation. Just a concept so far, I guess. Basically 
it fits into what we picture as a vote-filter. I.e. filter out all votes 
which are older than 2 years, and half of all the votes which are older 
than 1 year, ... and all the ones which are from voters outside the 
voting district, ...

&gt;<i> I think the design of Votorola allows for a better one.  Our users can
</I>&gt;<i> solve the problem themselves by simply talking to the zombie voters.
</I>&gt;<i> They can ask, &quot;Do you really want to continue voting for
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. Superstar?  Don't you realize he's changed his position since you
</I>&gt;<i> first supported him?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then they listen to the answers.  (Maybe this is an example of how
</I>&gt;<i> socializing the medium solves a problem of irrationality.)
</I>
But, what if they don't answer?

Best,
Thomas
