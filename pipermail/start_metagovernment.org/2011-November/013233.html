<PRE>Hi Ed,

&gt;<i> I agree with Alex that a page makes more sense than a group. A group is
</I>&gt;<i> internal to Facebook only, and thereby not &quot;open&quot; as the rest of our tools.
</I>&gt;<i> If we want a Facebook presence, I would suggest we post on the group that
</I>&gt;<i> the presence has moved to the Page, and invite people to come over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I am not sure about this. My understanding is that Facebook group permits
group chats. Something that I think facebook page do not do. Although we
have our yearly meeting, it would be nice to have spontaneous chats just
happen. Also I can imagine people working on various tools, and asking for
instant feedback. None of this is possible on a facebook page. Also I am
not sure it is a good thing to have a facebook page open to the public. We
want the public to come to our metagovernment.org page. We don't want to
start competing with ourself. Or maybe I am missing something.


 It's probably better that we make this general. Who is producing videos
&gt;&gt;<i> should not be the person administering them. Or something similar.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, at the moment, the only movie there was made by me (and it's rather
</I>&gt;<i> silly). But hopefully we can progress with the script in development and
</I>&gt;<i> make a true collaborative project to put up there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Regarding starting Vilfredo again, we are on our way to launch a separate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tool. And once this is done, I would like to recover Vilfredo, fix the UI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and revamp it. RIght now it's quite a mess. I had no time to follow it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thoroughly. But I do remember there was a time where we had multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questions running at the same time. So I have seen it working.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please keep the list informed. Even if you just need input on the
</I>&gt;<i> development, I think some people here would be glad to have something they
</I>&gt;<i> can contribute to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thank you. I am looking forward for the contributions.
