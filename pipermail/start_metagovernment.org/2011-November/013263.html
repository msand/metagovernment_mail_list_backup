One possible way could be, that this grant money goes into the 
disposition of the people who have already pledged money/time themselves 
(maybe proportional to their pledged amount).

Another idea I get: to have a sort of trust network. One is only 
eligible to vote, if he is trusted by a minimum number of (themselves) 
trusted members. Maybe the Votorola trust-network could be used for that.

Somehow I'd like to avoid rewarding people for spamming our list/wiki, 
which would be the case, if eligibility is bound to the number of posts etc.
