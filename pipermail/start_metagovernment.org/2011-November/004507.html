<PRE>Thursday I should speak about eDemocracy to the Movimento 5 Stelle in Rome.

Those are the people who are supporting Beppe Grillo, and are the most
active in the italian political sphere on eDemocracy.

I will use this week to prepare the talk, but I don't think I will
also have the time to prepare the video. What I will do is to record
the talk, and then make a video out of that. Unfortunately the video
will be in Italian. I can add subtitles though (so I learn how to do
them :-) ).

Cheers,
Pietro


P.S. I read in the other thread that the activist in Germany wants
participants to be Anonymous, not to register, and have people
participate only once.

This is generally not possible if you sum votes. It is possible with
Vilfredo, but I would NOT suggest to use Vilfredo as it is way to
complex for what they need. Instead if they are interested the new
Vilfredo Bubble system can be used, but they need to register. But
that is ready to be deployed. And is mathematically fair.

Here is an example:

It can also be added to a site as a plugin, just one question at a time:
