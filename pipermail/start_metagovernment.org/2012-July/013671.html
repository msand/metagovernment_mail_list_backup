<PRE>That is why I liked the solution proposed by Michael Allan: the Trojan Horse.

Demoex (Democracy Experiment)
Our solution is to implement direct democracy in the representative democratic system inside a party that works as a &#8220;trojan horse&#8221;.

of course it can always be better, and people have to think about that and how it can be done. But comparing with the Swiss people and their system most of us, in the representative systems, are in the middle ages of democracy. And I think we have to evolve step by step. To come where they are now the Swiss people needed 130 years and they are still working on their system, like the Oregon people after 100 years of direct democracy. And what we think about their system is not half as important as how they themselves feel about their political system. 
The trick for us, in representative systems, will be to propose and to get accepted steps towards a &#8220;better&#8221; system. Like for the moment a &#8220;landkreis&#8221; in Germany has accepted to use &#8220;liquid feedback&#8221;. Not decisive yet but as a first step.

Once the people have the power to build themselves on their political system there will be an evolution powered by young people who are practically born with a free internet, and an unprecedented freedom and possibility of communication. (in my younger years I was a radio amateur and only technical conversation was allowed or they retracted your licence.!! and that is only some decades ago.)
Of course I would like to go faster but maybe after all, that is not a good idea also. We have to fight for it, and if we don&#8217;t want to fight for it we wouldn't keep it anyway.

The swiss system is generally not a direct democracy system. At least as far as I could tell when I went there, and how a swiss friend explained it to me. Although some valleys with thousands inhabitants might do things differently. Meeting, and raising swords and sickles. 

What they have is representative democracy where it is possible to have referendum that approve laws (in Italy referendum can only delete laws). As a result when a referendum is being prepared, the politicians vote a watered down version of the law that the referendum was going to pass with the aim to get enough traction away from the referendum that the will of the people (or actually of the few people who wrote the referendum) does not really becomes law. 

There are also some problems with this. For example you can end up with a law that is in contraddiction with other laws
Not a mob rue, not direct democracy, and also not good enough by my standard.
