<PRE>The swiss system is generally not a direct democracy system. At least as
far as I could tell when I went there, and how a swiss friend explained it
to me. Although some valleys with thousands inhabitants might do things
differently. Meeting, and raising swords and sickles.

What they have is representative democracy where it is possible to have
referendum that approve laws (in Italy referendum can only delete laws). As
a result when a referendum is being prepared, the politicians vote a
watered down version of the law that the referendum was going to pass with
the aim to get enough traction away from the referendum that the will of
the people (or actually of the few people who wrote the referendum) does
not really becomes law.

There are also some problems with this. For example you can end up with a
law that is in contraddiction with other laws
Not a mob rue, not direct democracy, and also not good enough by my
standard.
