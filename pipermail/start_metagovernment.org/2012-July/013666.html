<PRE>Consensus has not been very popular in history because it requires a sophisticated system to enable it or it requires a relatively homogenous society to use it. The best example from history I know of is the Quakers, who do use a very good consensus model:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making#Quaker_model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making#Quaker_model</A>

But the Quakers are a fairly homogenous society, so they can rely on norms to help guide the process. And since they share many core beliefs, reaching consensus is easier.

For a more diverse community, what is needed -- and what has never been available before -- is some sophisticated mechanism to help drive consensus. That is the point of the projects here. Our systems aren't just for voting, they are for consensus-building. That requires a different approach to the process form the start. Most governance systems channel all decision-making into yes-no questions: &quot;should we adopt this proposal or not.&quot; Collaborative governance is about finding the proposal that will work for the community... and then incidentally adopting it.

If direct democracy does not focus on consensus-building and just overlays itself onto a majority-rule system, then it is (by its very definition) just mob rule. I don't see the benefit of that.

</I>&gt;<i> There are a lot of  direct democracy systems around, operating for more than centuries, where we can learn from. Several states in the US celebrated 100 years of direct democracy and Switzerland has more than 13O years of experience.
</I>&gt;<i> They all have developed systems from experience. Dividing a canton in two and give the people of the  communities the choice to witch canton they want to belong (Bern divided in bern and Jura). They have developed the system of &#8220;double majority&#8221; (cantons and people) but nowhere there is an evolution to a 2/3 majority, let alone a consensus. Any true &#8220;democratic&#8221; system, witch means for me &#8220;direct legislative power of the people&#8221;  has to grow bottom up. Evolutions where the people has the power to develop their own &#8220;democratic&#8221; system are therefore very important to study.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yes, this seems right. But it take a lot of effort, and money if you can find it, to start an initiative and to guide it all the way to a decisive referendum. The whole process takes maybe some years, and that is a good thing, impulsive proposals are often dangerous and sparked by emotional events.  This makes that the greater the chances that someone highjacks your initiative on the way the fewer chances that an initiative will be started at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the U.S., our national legislature is creating laws continuously. Plus our state and local legislatures pass/change/repeal many, many laws each year. But referenda are limited to a few on a ballot every couple of years at best.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Why should it be like that? Why do we need to limit the power of the citizenry to only occasionally making laws, when the legislature is doing it all the time?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I think the requirement of consensus is all the barrier that needs to be placed on law-making. It would certainly cut down on the number and frequency of laws, and it would have only beneficial repercussions. You don't get impulsive laws from a consensus-based system.
