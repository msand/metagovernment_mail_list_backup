&gt;<i> In the [above], are you saying this system is entirely decentralized
</I>&gt;<i> because two different vote mirrors are aggregating the votes made in
</I>&gt;<i> three systems? Thus, there is no single point of failure: one can
</I>&gt;<i> look at either vote mirror and determine the nature of voting across
</I>&gt;<i> the three systems. Is that right?
</I>
Yes.  The user is free to migrate between (m1, m2), or to erect a new
mirror (m3) with another view of the results.  Likewise he is free to
migrate among the voting facilities (c1, d1, d2), or to erect a new
facility.  So these points of failure are bypassable by ordinary
social or technical means.

&gt;<i> If so, isn't even that still centralized in that the two mirrors
</I>&gt;<i> would have to be the same software? If they are different, then
</I>&gt;<i> there is a high likelihood that they would produce different
</I>&gt;<i> results, wouldn't they? If they are the same, then isn't there a
</I>&gt;<i> presupposition that the community has already &quot;centralized&quot; into
</I>&gt;<i> deciding to use that one form of software?
</I>
More likely the two mirrors would have different software.  Mirroring
is based on translation.  Consider an analogy with natural language.
Below are the results summed across all three sources in original form
(c1+d1+d2), followed by the two mirrored views (m1, m2):

  (c1+d1+d2)  Guten Tag, mon ami.  How are you?

        (m1)  Bonjour, mon ami.  Comment &#231;a va?

        (m2)  Good day, my friend.  How are you?

This is how mirroring works, except that it translates votes instead
of words.  It translates from multiple source languages (ballot forms)
into a single destination language.  Users who prefer &quot;French&quot; ballots
will vote on (d1) and view the results on (m1), which would run
&quot;French&quot; mirroring software.  Meanwhile (m2) would run &quot;English&quot;.

&gt;<i> I am not saying that that particular form of centralization is
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily bad. I am just trying to frame the discussion. It seems
</I>&gt;<i> to me that no matter how much freedom we try to enable in
</I>&gt;<i> participation, at some point a community has to decide on a decision
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism. In my mind, that is what defines them as a community in
</I>&gt;<i> the first place: they are the group of people who have agreed to
</I>&gt;<i> govern themselves in the same way.
</I>
Right, so they are a community of self governance.  We can define a
community of *governance* by communications in the form of decisions
and enforcements.  These require a degree of centralization, and
typically that means a single decision mechanism (I agree).
Traditional examples are electoral systems, legislative assemblies and
presidents.  Call these &quot;authoritative&quot; mechanisms, because they tell
us what *is to be*.

We also have &quot;normative&quot; mechanisms that tell us what *ought* to be.
These are never centralized, because normative decision making is
decentered by nature.  It has these properties: *

  (n) Ubiquitous - everybody has access
  (o) Equal - nobody gets special treatment
  (p) Free of power - thus competent to direct power
  (q) Personal - each person chooses his/her own mechanism

A community of *self* governance, then, is one in which the
authoritative decisions are effectively guided by the normative
decisions.  This happens in small communities quite naturally, without
need of formal mechanisms.  People just talk to each other.  It does
not happen in larger communities.

In the very largest of communities, the party system has captured the
authoritative mechanisms.  It captured them by producing normative-
-form decisions in primary elections (who *ought* to hold office) and
legislative committees (what *ought* to be the laws).  Unfortunately
these normative decisions are lacking in normative content (n-q).

This suggests a possible way forward.  We might create parties that
are parties in form, but devoid of actual party content.  Instead they
house all the normative decision making (n-q) that the party system
lacks.  I'll post a separate proposal for this.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; even if so, it seems important to re-state it here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True.  We previously discussed how a system, even if it is decentered,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may nevertheless depend on a center for some aspects of its operation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (I think we were speaking of Outcast.)  Imagine three separate systems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of different architectural design.  One is primarily *centered* in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structure (c1), while two are primarily *decentered* (d1, d2):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     (c1) (d1) (d2)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The internal designs of these systems are of no consequence for our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussion of vote mirroring.  But imagine two external vote mirrors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (m1, m2):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          (m1)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          / \
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         / ^ \      ^
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        /  |  \     |  vote imaging
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       /   |   \
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     (c1) (d1) (d2)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       \   |   /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        \  |  /     |
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         \ v /      v
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          \ /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          (m2)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If (m1) and (m2) have no connection aside from the 3 shared vote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sources, then the whole of the 5 systems/nodes is a purely de-centered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; network.  But if (m1) and (m2) are Outcast mirrors, and if (d2) is an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Outcast source, then we could draw it like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          (m1) &lt;---+
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          / \       \
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         / ^ \       \
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        /  |  \       \
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       /   |   \       \
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     (c1) (d1) (d2) &lt;--(p1)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       \   |   /       /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        \  |  /       /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         \ v /       /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          \ /       /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          (m2) &lt;---+
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;              &lt;-- reading shared data from (p1)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here it is clear that the Outcast nodes (m1, m2, d2) depend on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; common pollwiki (p1) for aspects of their operation.  A pollwiki is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; central facility that cannot be replaced or duplicated in the normal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course of operation.  Therefore Outcast is not purely decentered.  (We
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want it to be, but it's not there yet.)
