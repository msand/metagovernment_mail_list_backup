The german pirate party has problems with liquid feedback and it has not been 
successful so far (also mentioned in the Spiegel.de article). I don't know of 
any major issue being resolved through the platform and it has always only 
been of recommendational character for the party assemblies. It is also a 
system focused on approving proposals brought forward from party activists and 
most people can only vote, not really change the proposals. You have to look 
at the process to understand why this happens:
In LF you have one level of proposed improvements/corrections to these initial 
proposals, but they have to outrun the majority on the previous proposal and 
do not flow.  Also you cannot improve these proposals anymore without further 
fractioning the voters behind the first improvement proposal (because they 
then have to decide between the too almost identical versions and therefore 
split the consent behind 99% of the text of the initial proposal). So the 
tooling is heavily favouring the initial proposal and therefore party 
activists. It also lacks serious social theory, which (this was one reason for 
me to even take Votorola seriously in the first place) Votorola does for 
instance, with references to Habermas' theory of communicative action. You 
cannot approach such a tooling and don't build in prejudices easily, so you at 
least have to frame the terms used and general social concepts behind it with 
social theory and not some web 2.0 buzzwords and technical concepts.

I have installed it myself (as my preferred initial solution) and tried it as 
a basis for my own concepts before I even knew Votorola and LF has many 
problems in itself already, because it is designed after the model of a 
political party, which can be argued to be a part of our problem not the 
solution. I have been to several left and democratic parties here (in Germany) 
and also watched the PirateParty and participated a bit in Occupy and I think 
they have no real concept for developping democracy but rather try to demand 
(from whom?) liberal democracy without a lot of critical reflection. They also 
depend so much on status quo relations already, that democratic decisions 
cannot be made about the party form itself, but they rather have to do 
realpolitik and they really do sacrifice democracy by a thousand small cuts in 
this process. I can name sexist formal decisions to disable quotas by smiling 
about them with the Green youth or Die Linke as well as the Pirates as one 
example of their weakness and the lack of insight in the lack of democracy and 
the problems it always brings in the long run.

They also stick to liberal democracy to demand their rights, but shareholder 
companies and therefore big banks are the most democratical institutions in 
the world in a liberal sense (because of the share concept). 
Also how can you demand democracy against big bank bailouts for Europe without 
asking all of the world population about the potential collapse of the 
financial markets or how to restructure the markets? It is this well hidden 
implicit concept of individual rights, that you still frame the democratic 
issue around nationalities (or better nation-states) and some sort of original 
land-ownership (also native initiatives etc.), which is part of the problem 
and not of the solution. Are you really allowed to decide what happens in 
North America even if I disagree? How come? Can I demand land there with the 
same rights you have? 

While Occupy people were generally motivated about the concepts proposed, they 
have brought little insights to the table of what democracy really means to 
&quot;them&quot;. The processes they used have been very inspiring though, yet not 
enough to form a collective engine to drive the process (yet). There is a lot 
of backyard activity with gardening, open-sourcing and community efforts, so 
this might be an illusion.
In LF you also have to categorize proposals and assign them to ressorts 
beforehand and they are not allowed to be similar to others or span all of 
society that way or even change over time in this metastructure (categorical) 
way. (Think about climate change issues moving to an economical debate and 
vice versa. Same as Wikipedia reproduces a lot of common sense categories 
about the world.)

I want to take a step back from the discussion here and argue that you assume 
quite some things, as many people here do about democracy. You assume that the 
swiss or US voting systems are closer to democracy than other societies with 
different mechanisms because they are &quot;direct&quot; in some ways. But especially 
Switzerland has had a big problem with racism lately and is far from being a 
good society. It is very priviliged by managing the money of mostly criminal 
or dubious sources (the very banks profiting and partially responsible for the 
crisis) and this is the major source of its income. Therefore liberal 
democratical values for Swiss people are high, but Switzerland for example 
also didn't help Jews trying to escape Germany during the Nazi period. 

Mobb rule says that the majority decides and that's it, it is very well 
allowed to doom minorities or outsiders. Consent on the other hand has no 
mechanism and is always meant inclusive without borders. It is so fragile that 
the the problem is the process, not the final decision. 

My argument is that you cannot found democracy on some abstract principle, 
without relying either on private property for the sake of the individuum 
(voter) and therefore excluding almost all of reality (which is owned 
privately today, including rights to pollute e.g.) at the same time from the 
democratic process. You can even decide on privatisation democratically and 
therefore sacrifice democracy by removing it from deciding over the resource 
at hand. 
Therefore you have to find a process which generates consent from the inside 
to find social foundations to drive the structure of the process. The very 
fragileness of consent and the need to attract people (which you correctly 
assume are barely interested in investing a lot of time in political issue on 
an e-dem platform, because politics is pointless for them nowadays), points to 
the fact that democracy is only appealing to people who already have a sense 
of individual rights and can use them if they have them, but is not promising 
any changes to people in economically bad situations, because they cannot 
realize their rights anyway (look at Afghanistan or the Arab spring e.g.). 
What does democracy help you if you are unemployed? It is this very dirty 
economical details we have to solve with these frustrated people to show the 
true value of democracy and even find out what we mean with it ourselves. And 
if democracy is really worth all our efforts, it should at least be able to 
address these issues.
If it is thought as this collective reflection process to create a better 
(also material) situation for everybody then you don't have to formalize 
social relations on private property, but you can if you want to (which is the 
condition for democracy anyway). The structure itself melts and becomes part 
of the process.

If you can point out concrete successes or capabilities of LF we are eager to 
know them though, because it is not the tooling that is really relevant, but 
the concepts to push this process forward and work together. Good ideas are 
always welcome and we (from Votorola) seek cooperation on building the first 
cross-platform consent.
In this sense I see new applications of e-democracy, even if it is only for 
the &quot;Kommune Friesland&quot; as a progress, but I don't think LF in its current 
form will be able to leverage the true capacity open for e-democracy and 
create a lot of further frustration for people heavily involved in the issue. 
For this reason we (at least from Votorola), propose vote mirroring to allow a 
total yet decentralized structure with different approaches to consent making 
and the possibility to &quot;fork&quot; at any time without loss of consent. It is this 
consent which allows every stakeholder in the Linux kernel to share a common 
code base, because everybody is profiting and nobody is locked in. Even though 
Torvalds acts a leader, he is balanced amazingly well by the process, because 
everybody profits. This doesn't solve all problems automagically, but it gives 
an idea how important the material possibilities and economical outcomes of 
process are to its democratical capabilities even if it lacked them in the 
beginning or explicitly. Linus Torvalds has defended the right to fork and 
even sees value in it himself.
