&gt;<i> yes, this seems right. But it take a lot of effort, and money if you can find it, to start an initiative and to guide it all the way to a decisive referendum. The whole process takes maybe some years, and that is a good thing, impulsive proposals are often dangerous and sparked by emotional events.  This makes that the greater the chances that someone highjacks your initiative on the way the fewer chances that an initiative will be started at all.

In the U.S., our national legislature is creating laws continuously. Plus our state and local legislatures pass/change/repeal many, many laws each year. But referenda are limited to a few on a ballot every couple of years at best.

Why should it be like that? Why do we need to limit the power of the citizenry to only occasionally making laws, when the legislature is doing it all the time?

I think the requirement of consensus is all the barrier that needs to be placed on law-making. It would certainly cut down on the number and frequency of laws, and it would have only beneficial repercussions. You don't get impulsive laws from a consensus-based system.
