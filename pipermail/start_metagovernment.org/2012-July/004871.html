&gt;<i> One challenge we're hoping to address in the future is shared by others working on active projects - managing the initiation, evolution and evaluation of proposals.  How do you balance the competing needs of different stages in its lifecycle?  One idea I've had is having proposals gather sponsors, with redrafting tools evolving as the scale of the sponsor base does.  For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 1 sponsor - the author controls everything
</I>&gt;<i> up to 10 sponsors - consensus drafting tools, 90% &quot;yes&quot; votes needed to advance
</I>&gt;<i> 10-100 sponsors - idea is introduced to voting system, amendment drafting system balances conformity to original intent with need for continued improvement
</I>&gt;<i> 100-1000 sponsors - document direction becomes narrowly bound, but body of evidence documenting rationale and likely impacts grows
</I>&gt;<i> 1000+ sponsors - we should be so lucky!  A bridge to cross then...

See note 3 of this page:

When reading your text above, I was stricken by the parallelism in thinking.

Separately, I should point you also to Pietro. Read this from his recent post:

</I>

I believe his evaluation process is a different take on managing proposals when there are too many for one individual to process: simply show subsets at random, and aggregate the results.
