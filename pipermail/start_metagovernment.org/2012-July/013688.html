OK, I'll play devil's advocate.

There are 2.14 billion shares of Facebook. Currently it is at $23.15 per share. Supposing we could completely devastate the price down to 50 cents per share, we would still need over a billion dollars.

I'm not saying it's impossible to get it down that low, nor to raise that much money. But for that kind of money, usually people would want something in return.

I know, there are nearly a billion Facebook users, so all we would need is $1 from each one of them (assuming the very optimistic 50 cent price). But factor out kids and shell accounts and those for whom $1 is a large amount of money. Then factor out the apathetic. In the US, National Public Radio is very well respected, and its listenership is generally on the wealthier side. I believe one in twelve listeners contribute anything (there is no minimum). So what percent of FB users could really be expected to contribute even $1?

With all that said, I don't think it can hurt to try. My primary suggestion would be one of message. While to me the valuable thing would be freeing Facebook for me to use (since I agree with Thomas: now it is just a way to give my private data to corporations), for the billion people who do use it, that's obviously not an issue. Instead, the message should be: &quot;remove all ads from Facebook forever.&quot; My guess is that would have *much* stronger appeal.

I think a Facebook group makes sense, as it is just too beautiful to run the campaign from within Facebook. However, Facebook has the right to close down groups whenever it wants. For example:
<A HREF="http://techsavvyagent.com/video/facebook-shuts-down-page-with-47000-fans/">http://techsavvyagent.com/video/facebook-shuts-down-page-with-47000-fans/</A> (and there are many more).
If they shut down the group, all data is just evaporated. So there should be an external petition such as on
<A HREF="http://www.change.org/">http://www.change.org/</A>
What I don't know is if it would be humanly workable to ask people to join a group and sign a petition. It's the right approach, but asking for two clicks may be a pretty high barrier. I think start the group, but always keep the focus on the petition, not the group.

Additionally, it would make sense to have a coordinating page, again outside of Facebook. It gives more flexibility than a petition, and it gives a &quot;face&quot; to the petition. A page on the Metagov wiki might work well for that. It's in-line with our goals (an open Facebook would provide some amazing capabilities for collaborative governance) and it might bring us some sidelong publicity. And if we're successful, then how would FB be governed? Why, with our tools of course, right?

Or, as a complete alternative, we could look at just starting up a new Facebook. Sounds like a much longer road to travel, though. I like the idea of at least trying your way first.
