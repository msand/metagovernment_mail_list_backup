It might be of interest to know that a Norwegian joke party had a
platform somewhat like this. While it would not put the selection of
candidates in the hands of the public, all the candidates (both of them)
pledged to follow the public's will. Now, that might sound like what any
politician would say, but they had a very precise definition in mind:
they would put up a web poll about each parliamentary decision-to-be and
then follow the people's decision according to that poll.

See <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Political_Party_(Norway">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Political_Party_(Norway</A>) for more
information.
