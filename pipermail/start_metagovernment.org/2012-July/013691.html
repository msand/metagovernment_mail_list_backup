In one way you are right, but these people don't just want to buy it, 
they would also just as easily go away and leave it behind, deserted and 
worthless. Only the second point makes the price fall.

In theory we should be able to press down the price to almost zero, 
shouldn't we. But ofc we would need a number of probably 90% of all 
users to agree to move away. But then, that should just be a question of 
time, right?

Thinking of a reward, I can imagine there is also some fun-factor in 
this as a reward, the fun of taking control over one's own network. 
Besides pure benevolence.

&gt;<i> I know, there are nearly a billion Facebook users, so all we would 
</I>&gt;<i> need is $1 from each one of them (assuming the very optimistic 50 cent 
</I>&gt;<i> price). 
</I>
This gives me the idea that it would be cool to have a calculated number 
running on that page ... the current amount of how much each user would 
have to spend atm to buy the rest of facebook ... and see this number 
constantly dropping.

&gt;<i> Instead, the message should be: &quot;remove all ads from Facebook 
</I>&gt;<i> forever.&quot; My guess is that would have *much* stronger appeal. 
</I>
Yes, I like that! Maybe we can have both: &quot;remove all ads from Facebook 
forever and take control of your data!&quot;

&gt;<i> However, Facebook has the right to close down groups whenever it wants. 
</I>
Ok, that is a real danger!

&gt;<i> [...] So there should be an external petition such as on 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.change.org/">http://www.change.org/</A> What I don't know is if it would be humanly 
</I>&gt;<i> workable to ask people to join a group and sign a petition. It's the 
</I>&gt;<i> right approach, but asking for two clicks may be a pretty high barrier.
</I>
Maybe we can even use this danger for our purpose. Somehow write: &quot;Let's 
see, how big we can grow, until facebook shuts us down and thereby 
proves us right once more in our effort of making it open! If that 
happens let's go here (external petition)!&quot;

&gt;<i> Additionally, it would make sense to have a coordinating page, again 
</I>&gt;<i> outside of Facebook. It gives more flexibility than a petition, and it 
</I>&gt;<i> gives a &quot;face&quot; to the petition. A page on the Metagov wiki might work 
</I>&gt;<i> well for that. It's in-line with our goals (an open Facebook would 
</I>&gt;<i> provide some amazing capabilities for collaborative governance) and it 
</I>&gt;<i> might bring us some sidelong publicity.
</I>
Sounds great to me! I wait for some more replies and then I start. :-)

Best,
Thomas
