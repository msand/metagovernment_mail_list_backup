<PRE>I had been thinking of trying an initiative like this in the U.S. (after our November elections, since it is too late to start now anyway and since the day after yet-another-disappointing-election would be a good day to launch the process).

In some states in the U.S., establishing a formal party is an extremely difficult task. The current parties have entrenched themselves so well that they have raised enormous barriers to the establishment of competing parties.

I was considering tackling this process as an unofficial party, where there is a national organizing unit, but no official presence in the states. Instead, individuals run as individuals. I think that is consistent with your proposal, since you &quot;force&quot; individuals representing the other political parties to run in this party's primary, right?

However, I do want to draw your attention to somewhat of a real-world criticism of this idea. The state of California radically changed its primary process for this year's primary. It opened its primaries so that all candidates ran against each other in the primary (sort of making a round 1 election, and turning the official election into a runoff). However, according to critics, the end result was basically the same as before: the big political parties dominated the process and ran it the same way as always:

I understand your proposal is substantially different. I'm just pointing out that there is a *lot* of inertia in the U.S. political system.

P.S. What software would be up to the task of managing your proposed party?
