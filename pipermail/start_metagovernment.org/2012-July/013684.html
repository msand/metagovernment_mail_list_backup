<PRE>I don't always agree with Conseo about the priority of economic reform
over political reform, but I do agree the two are interconnected and
interwoven in places.  And thanks to Conseo's persistence, we now have
some economics in the design of Votorola/Outcast.  We have a resource
accounting mechanism in which votes and pledges are bound together:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Category:Account">http://zelea.com/w/Category:Account</A>

Comparing the benefits and shortcomings of Liquid Feedback and
Votorola is less important, I think, than evaluating the opportunities
we have to cooperate.  Resource accounting may be another example of
that.  We take Thomas's idea of vote mirroring and we extend it to
pledges.  This gives us not only a consensus that stretches across
multiple platforms, but also a pool of resources to act on it.

Eventually our projects will cooperate in such ways if they survive.
There must be a degree of cooperation.  We don't say that because we
think it is preferable to the alternative, but because we know there
is no alternative.  We know the reasons and we don't keep them to
ourselves, but broadcast them everywhere we go.  And we've yet to find
the person who can refute them.  But it's worth the effort, because if
we didn't have this constant confirmation of eventual success, then
we'd probably have lost courage long ago and quit, like so many other
projects have.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there will be an evolution powered by young people who are practically born
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a free internet, and an unprecedented freedom and possibility of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication. (in my younger years I was a radio amateur and only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technical conversation was allowed or they retracted your licence.!! and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is only some decades ago.) Of course I would like to go faster but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe after all, that is not a good idea also. We have to fight for it, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if we don&#8217;t want to fight for it we wouldn't keep it anyway. Paul
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The german pirate party has problems with liquid feedback and it has not been 
</I>&gt;<i> successful so far (also mentioned in the Spiegel.de article). I don't know of 
</I>&gt;<i> any major issue being resolved through the platform and it has always only 
</I>&gt;<i> been of recommendational character for the party assemblies. It is also a 
</I>&gt;<i> system focused on approving proposals brought forward from party activists and 
</I>&gt;<i> most people can only vote, not really change the proposals. You have to look 
</I>&gt;<i> at the process to understand why this happens:
</I>&gt;<i> In LF you have one level of proposed improvements/corrections to these initial 
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, but they have to outrun the majority on the previous proposal and 
</I>&gt;<i> do not flow.  Also you cannot improve these proposals anymore without further 
</I>&gt;<i> fractioning the voters behind the first improvement proposal (because they 
</I>&gt;<i> then have to decide between the too almost identical versions and therefore 
</I>&gt;<i> split the consent behind 99% of the text of the initial proposal). So the 
</I>&gt;<i> tooling is heavily favouring the initial proposal and therefore party 
</I>&gt;<i> activists. It also lacks serious social theory, which (this was one reason for 
</I>&gt;<i> me to even take Votorola seriously in the first place) Votorola does for 
</I>&gt;<i> instance, with references to Habermas' theory of communicative action. You 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot approach such a tooling and don't build in prejudices easily, so you at 
</I>&gt;<i> least have to frame the terms used and general social concepts behind it with 
</I>&gt;<i> social theory and not some web 2.0 buzzwords and technical concepts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have installed it myself (as my preferred initial solution) and tried it as 
</I>&gt;<i> a basis for my own concepts before I even knew Votorola and LF has many 
</I>&gt;<i> problems in itself already, because it is designed after the model of a 
</I>&gt;<i> political party, which can be argued to be a part of our problem not the 
</I>&gt;<i> solution. I have been to several left and democratic parties here (in Germany) 
</I>&gt;<i> and also watched the PirateParty and participated a bit in Occupy and I think 
</I>&gt;<i> they have no real concept for developping democracy but rather try to demand 
</I>&gt;<i> (from whom?) liberal democracy without a lot of critical reflection. They also 
</I>&gt;<i> depend so much on status quo relations already, that democratic decisions 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be made about the party form itself, but they rather have to do 
</I>&gt;<i> realpolitik and they really do sacrifice democracy by a thousand small cuts in 
</I>&gt;<i> this process. I can name sexist formal decisions to disable quotas by smiling 
</I>&gt;<i> about them with the Green youth or Die Linke as well as the Pirates as one 
</I>&gt;<i> example of their weakness and the lack of insight in the lack of democracy and 
</I>&gt;<i> the problems it always brings in the long run.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They also stick to liberal democracy to demand their rights, but shareholder 
</I>&gt;<i> companies and therefore big banks are the most democratical institutions in 
</I>&gt;<i> the world in a liberal sense (because of the share concept). 
</I>&gt;<i> Also how can you demand democracy against big bank bailouts for Europe without 
</I>&gt;<i> asking all of the world population about the potential collapse of the 
</I>&gt;<i> financial markets or how to restructure the markets? It is this well hidden 
</I>&gt;<i> implicit concept of individual rights, that you still frame the democratic 
</I>&gt;<i> issue around nationalities (or better nation-states) and some sort of original 
</I>&gt;<i> land-ownership (also native initiatives etc.), which is part of the problem 
</I>&gt;<i> and not of the solution. Are you really allowed to decide what happens in 
</I>&gt;<i> North America even if I disagree? How come? Can I demand land there with the 
</I>&gt;<i> same rights you have? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While Occupy people were generally motivated about the concepts proposed, they 
</I>&gt;<i> have brought little insights to the table of what democracy really means to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;them&quot;. The processes they used have been very inspiring though, yet not 
</I>&gt;<i> enough to form a collective engine to drive the process (yet). There is a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> of backyard activity with gardening, open-sourcing and community efforts, so 
</I>&gt;<i> this might be an illusion.
</I>&gt;<i> In LF you also have to categorize proposals and assign them to ressorts 
</I>&gt;<i> beforehand and they are not allowed to be similar to others or span all of 
</I>&gt;<i> society that way or even change over time in this metastructure (categorical) 
</I>&gt;<i> way. (Think about climate change issues moving to an economical debate and 
</I>&gt;<i> vice versa. Same as Wikipedia reproduces a lot of common sense categories 
</I>&gt;<i> about the world.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to take a step back from the discussion here and argue that you assume 
</I>&gt;<i> quite some things, as many people here do about democracy. You assume that the 
</I>&gt;<i> swiss or US voting systems are closer to democracy than other societies with 
</I>&gt;<i> different mechanisms because they are &quot;direct&quot; in some ways. But especially 
</I>&gt;<i> Switzerland has had a big problem with racism lately and is far from being a 
</I>&gt;<i> good society. It is very priviliged by managing the money of mostly criminal 
</I>&gt;<i> or dubious sources (the very banks profiting and partially responsible for the 
</I>&gt;<i> crisis) and this is the major source of its income. Therefore liberal 
</I>&gt;<i> democratical values for Swiss people are high, but Switzerland for example 
</I>&gt;<i> also didn't help Jews trying to escape Germany during the Nazi period. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mobb rule says that the majority decides and that's it, it is very well 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to doom minorities or outsiders. Consent on the other hand has no 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism and is always meant inclusive without borders. It is so fragile that 
</I>&gt;<i> the the problem is the process, not the final decision. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My argument is that you cannot found democracy on some abstract principle, 
</I>&gt;<i> without relying either on private property for the sake of the individuum 
</I>&gt;<i> (voter) and therefore excluding almost all of reality (which is owned 
</I>&gt;<i> privately today, including rights to pollute e.g.) at the same time from the 
</I>&gt;<i> democratic process. You can even decide on privatisation democratically and 
</I>&gt;<i> therefore sacrifice democracy by removing it from deciding over the resource 
</I>&gt;<i> at hand. 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore you have to find a process which generates consent from the inside 
</I>&gt;<i> to find social foundations to drive the structure of the process. The very 
</I>&gt;<i> fragileness of consent and the need to attract people (which you correctly 
</I>&gt;<i> assume are barely interested in investing a lot of time in political issue on 
</I>&gt;<i> an e-dem platform, because politics is pointless for them nowadays), points to 
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that democracy is only appealing to people who already have a sense 
</I>&gt;<i> of individual rights and can use them if they have them, but is not promising 
</I>&gt;<i> any changes to people in economically bad situations, because they cannot 
</I>&gt;<i> realize their rights anyway (look at Afghanistan or the Arab spring e.g.). 
</I>&gt;<i> What does democracy help you if you are unemployed? It is this very dirty 
</I>&gt;<i> economical details we have to solve with these frustrated people to show the 
</I>&gt;<i> true value of democracy and even find out what we mean with it ourselves. And 
</I>&gt;<i> if democracy is really worth all our efforts, it should at least be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> address these issues.
</I>&gt;<i> If it is thought as this collective reflection process to create a better 
</I>&gt;<i> (also material) situation for everybody then you don't have to formalize 
</I>&gt;<i> social relations on private property, but you can if you want to (which is the 
</I>&gt;<i> condition for democracy anyway). The structure itself melts and becomes part 
</I>&gt;<i> of the process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you can point out concrete successes or capabilities of LF we are eager to 
</I>&gt;<i> know them though, because it is not the tooling that is really relevant, but 
</I>&gt;<i> the concepts to push this process forward and work together. Good ideas are 
</I>&gt;<i> always welcome and we (from Votorola) seek cooperation on building the first 
</I>&gt;<i> cross-platform consent.
</I>&gt;<i> In this sense I see new applications of e-democracy, even if it is only for 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;Kommune Friesland&quot; as a progress, but I don't think LF in its current 
</I>&gt;<i> form will be able to leverage the true capacity open for e-democracy and 
</I>&gt;<i> create a lot of further frustration for people heavily involved in the issue. 
</I>&gt;<i> For this reason we (at least from Votorola), propose vote mirroring to allow a 
</I>&gt;<i> total yet decentralized structure with different approaches to consent making 
</I>&gt;<i> and the possibility to &quot;fork&quot; at any time without loss of consent. It is this 
</I>&gt;<i> consent which allows every stakeholder in the Linux kernel to share a common 
</I>&gt;<i> code base, because everybody is profiting and nobody is locked in. Even though 
</I>&gt;<i> Torvalds acts a leader, he is balanced amazingly well by the process, because 
</I>&gt;<i> everybody profits. This doesn't solve all problems automagically, but it gives 
</I>&gt;<i> an idea how important the material possibilities and economical outcomes of 
</I>&gt;<i> process are to its democratical capabilities even if it lacked them in the 
</I>&gt;<i> beginning or explicitly. Linus Torvalds has defended the right to fork and 
</I>&gt;<i> even sees value in it himself.
