<PRE>Subject: Public parties: a Trojan Horse in the party system

Kristofer and Paul,

Kristofer Munsterhjelm said:
&gt;<i> It might be of interest to know that a Norwegian joke party had a
</I>&gt;<i> platform somewhat like this. While it would not put the selection of
</I>&gt;<i> candidates in the hands of the public, all the candidates (both of
</I>&gt;<i> them) pledged to follow the public's will. Now, that might sound
</I>&gt;<i> like what any politician would say, but they had a very precise
</I>&gt;<i> definition in mind: they would put up a web poll about each
</I>&gt;<i> parliamentary decision-to-be and then follow the people's decision
</I>&gt;<i> according to that poll. ...

I can see the joke - a parody of democracy hung on marionette strings.

But there are no such strings in what I proposed.  Aside from what
they're already allowed by law (in elections), the public are given no
mechanism to control the actions of legislators.  Certainly the public
*party* gives them none, because (unlike a political party) it
exercises no control over nominees, candidates or elected officials.

But I value your opinion, Kristofer.  Do you seriously find any fault
in the proposal?  Any reason why it should fail to work?

&gt;<i> Demoex (Norway in Vallentuna a suburb of Stockholm) is indeed

Which way?  Norwegian joke party, or public party?
