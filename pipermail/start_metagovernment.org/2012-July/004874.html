<PRE>Hi Metagov,

I'm helping with the development of an opensource (non-profit status
seeking) platform with the goal of boosting election participation, and
facilitating political information sharing directly between users rather
than relying on centralized media sources. The site will provide a variety
of democracy facilitation tools, but the primary feature is to provide
users with at least basic information on every candidate from every
election ---federal, state, county, local, and others--- that they are
eligible to vote in, all found on a single, easy to browse web page. We
also want to make all candidate data we gather openly accessible for anyone
to use and incorporate into their own projects.

If you'd like more information and example design documents, please check
out this post on /r/opensource <A HREF="http://tiny.cc/ofu7gw.">http://tiny.cc/ofu7gw.</A>

EveryVote.org is still in its infancy, but we think a crowdsourced database
of candidate data would be useful for many projects, so if anyone in the
Metagov community is potentially interested in collaborating for this
purpose, or has any feedback or questions for us, we'd love to hear from
you.

If you'd like more information on the EveryVote.org project in general:

And if you like the crowdsourced candidate data idea, we'd appreciate your
retweet for volunteer outreach:

Thanks very much for your consideration Metagov!
