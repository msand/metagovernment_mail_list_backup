<PRE>In the longer run, it doesn't make sense to have the premiere social media
site on the web run by a for-profit company which can just evaporate data
at will.  So we can figure something will change to make an open-source
facebook possible.

For now, the idea is chiefly an amusing way to generate interest in MG.

</I>&gt;<i> OK, I'll play devil's advocate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are 2.14 billion shares of Facebook. Currently it is at $23.15 per

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not saying it's impossible to get it down that low, nor to raise that
</I>&gt;<i> much money. But for that kind of money, usually people would want something
</I>&gt;<i> in return.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know, there are nearly a billion Facebook users, so all we would need is
</I>&gt;<i> $1 from each one of them (assuming the very optimistic 50 cent price). But
</I>&gt;<i> factor out kids and shell accounts and those for whom $1 is a large amount
</I>&gt;<i> of money. Then factor out the apathetic. In the US, National Public Radio
</I>&gt;<i> is very well respected, and its listenership is generally on the wealthier
</I>&gt;<i> side. I believe one in twelve listeners contribute anything (there is no
</I>&gt;<i> minimum). So what percent of FB users could really be expected to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute even $1?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With all that said, I don't think it can hurt to try. My primary
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion would be one of message. While to me the valuable thing would be
</I>&gt;<i> freeing Facebook for me to use (since I agree with Thomas: now it is just a
</I>&gt;<i> way to give my private data to corporations), for the billion people who do
</I>&gt;<i> use it, that's obviously not an issue. Instead, the message should be:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;remove all ads from Facebook forever.&quot; My guess is that would have *much*
</I>&gt;<i> stronger appeal.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think? Do you foresee any problems? I'm not so familiar with
</I>&gt;<i> facebook, so would a group and a call for membership in it, be the way to
</I>&gt;<i> go or are there better ways for this within facebook?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think a Facebook group makes sense, as it is just too beautiful to run
</I>&gt;<i> the campaign from within Facebook. However, Facebook has the right to close
</I>&gt;<i> down groups whenever it wants. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://techsavvyagent.com/video/facebook-shuts-down-page-with-47000-fans/(and">http://techsavvyagent.com/video/facebook-shuts-down-page-with-47000-fans/(and</A> there are many more).
</I>&gt;<i> If they shut down the group, all data is just evaporated. So there should
</I>&gt;<i> be an external petition such as on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.change.org/">http://www.change.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> What I don't know is if it would be humanly workable to ask people to join
</I>&gt;<i> a group and sign a petition. It's the right approach, but asking for two
</I>&gt;<i> clicks may be a pretty high barrier. I think start the group, but always
</I>&gt;<i> keep the focus on the petition, not the group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, it would make sense to have a coordinating page, again
</I>&gt;<i> outside of Facebook. It gives more flexibility than a petition, and it
</I>&gt;<i> gives a &quot;face&quot; to the petition. A page on the Metagov wiki might work well
</I>&gt;<i> for that. It's in-line with our goals (an open Facebook would provide some
</I>&gt;<i> amazing capabilities for collaborative governance) and it might bring us
</I>&gt;<i> some sidelong publicity. And if we're successful, then how would FB be
</I>&gt;<i> governed? Why, with our tools of course, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or, as a complete alternative, we could look at just starting up a new
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook. Sounds like a much longer road to travel, though. I like the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of at least trying your way first.
