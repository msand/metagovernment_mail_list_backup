<PRE>Hey guys,

I would like to use an open source alternative to Facebook. Mainly 
because I don't want a huge company to mess with my data. But since I 
can't convince my friends it doesn't work. I guess, there is a 
&quot;network-effect&quot; where people go where the others already are and then 
they all stay there. If this is true, open source alternatives will 
never have a chance.

So I was thinking, how can we open source facebook itself then!?

Since all of us here are into e-democracy, I don't have to convince 
anybody of the power of coordinated collaborative online-action. Now if 
we would ask the facebook-users if they want their network to be owned 
by themselves, a non-profit-organization or a big company ... I'm shure 
90% would vote against the company.

So then it's just a question of how to get our will. I propose to buy 
facebook and then make it open source. In order to buy it we ask the 
users something like:

&quot;Join this facebook-group, if you want facebook to become open source! 
The more members/momentum this group gains, the more people will be 
willing to donate some money to the non-profit-organization &quot;XY&quot; to buy 
facebook.

If the money doesn't rise as fast as the wishes for an open source 
network, and the members of this group make already 50% of all 
facebook-users, we will collectivly move over to an open-source 
alternative, like Diaspora, ... &quot;

The nice side-effect of this would be, that as the numbers rise, the 
price of facebook will fall ... until we can afford it.

What do you think? Do you foresee any problems? I'm not so familiar with 
facebook, so would a group and a call for membership in it, be the way 
to go or are there better ways for this within facebook?

Greetings,
Thomas
