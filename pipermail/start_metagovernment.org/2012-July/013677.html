<PRE>Sorry, demoex is active in Sweden (Stockholm) ;-)

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</A>

Demoex, an appellation short for democracy experiment, is a local Swedish 
political party and an experiment with direct democracy in Vallentuna, a 
suburb of Stockholm, Sweden.[1] It uses the Internet to make it possible for 
any member to participate in the local government. Demoex has a 
representative in the municipal council, who votes in the council according 
to a poll that is held beforehand on the website of the party. This is 
unlike traditional representatives, who vote according to their own views or 
their party's views. Every Vallentuna resident older than 16 years can 
register on the website to vote; anyone in the world can take part in the 
debates, if they can write in Swedish. Voters do not have to vote on all 
issues; the fewer votes on an issue, the more weight each vote carries. To 
boost participation, the party allows users to choose someone to advise them 
on a particular topic.

Demoex started 10 years ago.

I can see the joke - a parody of democracy hung on marionette strings.

But there are no such strings in what I proposed.  Aside from what
they're already allowed by law (in elections), the public are given no
mechanism to control the actions of legislators.  Certainly the public
*party* gives them none, because (unlike a political party) it
exercises no control over nominees, candidates or elected officials.

But I value your opinion, Kristofer.  Do you seriously find any fault
in the proposal?  Any reason why it should fail to work?

Which way?  Norwegian joke party, or public party?
