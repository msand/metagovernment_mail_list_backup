&gt;<i> A serious issue that I have with LiquidFeedback and other proxy voting systems is the significant security flaws should they be deployed in the United States. There is no way to prevent sockpuppets from overtaking the system with a naked proxy voting network, and even clique detection or other graph based methods are not always effective.

Speaking of neighborhoods, perhaps this would be of interest:

&gt;<i> On the method of collaboration there needs to be a differentiation between local and global synthesis. At the local group level, for instance my neighborhood, it would be rather simple to amend a document and gather consensus around that amendment. At the global level this becomes impossible. For that reason the communicative deliberation process outlined here, and its counterpart of pyramidal democracy, is the best way to synthesize ideas.

</I>&gt;<i> What that looks like in reality I am unsure.

My feeling is that we just can't know until society as a whole has more experience with collaborative governance. In terms of democracy, we as a society are infants. Governing planetary society in with a fully democratic system is a very grown-up task.

We would be better off forming small collaborative governance systems and learning from their successes and failures how to scale them. At the same time, we will be training the participants to take responsibility for their own governance: something that most people are trained oppositely on now.

&gt;<i> However I am open to including these kind of models in <A HREF="http://openassembly.org.">http://openassembly.org.</A> We are working on a new design for the occupy national gathering that includes a small-world democratic decision model. I will definitely post my experiences here.
</I>
I think what you are talking about is similar to a project Pietro is or had been working on: branching out deliberation into subgroups and then later aggregating them back into a larger whole. Pietro, does that sound right?
