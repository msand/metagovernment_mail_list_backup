<PRE>Sorry for the long delay. Michael, I'm not sure I understand your diagrams clearly, so I'll try to re-state them and see if I get it right.

In the first one, are you saying this system is entirely decentralized because two different vote mirrors are aggregating the votes made in three systems? Thus, there is no single point of failure: one can look at either vote mirror and determine the nature of voting across the three systems. Is that right?

If so, isn't even that still centralized in that the two mirrors would have to be the same software? If they are different, then there is a high likelihood that they would produce different results, wouldn't they? If they are the same, then isn't there a presupposition that the community has already &quot;centralized&quot; into deciding to use that one form of software?

I am not saying that that particular form of centralization is necessarily bad. I am just trying to frame the discussion. It seems to me that no matter how much freedom we try to enable in participation, at some point a community has to decide on a decision mechanism. In my mind, that is what defines them as a community in the first place: they are the group of people who have agreed to govern themselves in the same way.

</I>&gt;<i> True.  We previously discussed how a system, even if it is decentered,
</I>&gt;<i> may nevertheless depend on a center for some aspects of its operation.
</I>&gt;<i> (I think we were speaking of Outcast.)  Imagine three separate systems

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     (c1) (d1) (d2)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The internal designs of these systems are of no consequence for our
</I>&gt;<i> discussion of vote mirroring.  But imagine two external vote mirrors
</I>&gt;<i> (m1, m2):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>          (m1)
</I>&gt;<i>          / \
</I>&gt;<i>         / ^ \      ^
</I>&gt;<i>        /  |  \     |  vote imaging
</I>&gt;<i>       /   |   \
</I>&gt;<i>     (c1) (d1) (d2)
</I>&gt;<i>       \   |   /

</I>&gt;<i>         \ v /      v
</I>&gt;<i>          \ /
</I>&gt;<i>          (m2)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If (m1) and (m2) have no connection aside from the 3 shared vote
</I>&gt;<i> sources, then the whole of the 5 systems/nodes is a purely de-centered
</I>&gt;<i> network.  But if (m1) and (m2) are Outcast mirrors, and if (d2) is an
</I>&gt;<i> Outcast source, then we could draw it like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>          (m1) &lt;---+
</I>&gt;<i>          / \       \
</I>&gt;<i>         / ^ \       \
</I>&gt;<i>        /  |  \       \
</I>&gt;<i>       /   |   \       \
</I>&gt;<i>     (c1) (d1) (d2) &lt;--(p1)
</I>&gt;<i>       \   |   /       /
</I>&gt;<i>        \  |  /       /
</I>&gt;<i>         \ v /       /
</I>&gt;<i>          \ /       /
</I>&gt;<i>          (m2) &lt;---+
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>              &lt;-- reading shared data from (p1)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here it is clear that the Outcast nodes (m1, m2, d2) depend on a
</I>&gt;<i> common pollwiki (p1) for aspects of their operation.  A pollwiki is a
</I>&gt;<i> central facility that cannot be replaced or duplicated in the normal
</I>&gt;<i> course of operation.  Therefore Outcast is not purely decentered.  (We
</I>&gt;<i> want it to be, but it's not there yet.)
