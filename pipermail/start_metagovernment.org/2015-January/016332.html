If by &quot;votes&quot; you mean &quot;power&quot;, yes.  A conflict of interest is a very
specific term, legally speaking.  In most cases it means that someone
personally financially benefits from their actions.  The farther you
get from the one-person-one-vote ideal, the more common these
arrangements become.  In the NY example, I can just see the
dockworkers jumping all over that &quot;tie ships to the electric grid&quot;
thing, and teachers jumping all over the &quot;more money for schools&quot;
thing because both groups will get paid more directly as a result of
pushing those proposals.  There should be no problem with them
proposing these things or arguing for them, but if you use the results
of this first phase to set priorities (which is what anything other
than a direct mass vote requires), you've designed an inherently
corrupt system.

&gt;<i> Most of us live with undisclosed conflicts IMHO, there is a talk by Chomsky
</I>&gt;<i> about it.

I definitely relate to his concerns about intellectuals and this is
partially what inspires me to take my project on.  He calls it
&quot;doublethink&quot; (I usually call it compartmentalization), but the idea
is that people in situations where their prejudices or their
livelihoods are being threatened simply ignore or deny the facts
rather than work through the conflict to find real solutions.  He also
makes a good point that the existing systems work as filters such that
people who would be willing and able to work on these kinds of
conflicts are just weeded out.  I certainly don't expect anyone in
power now, and that includes anybody in an academic position
(particularly political scientists), to pursue anything like this
because they have this kind inherent conflict of interest.  Even if
it's something as mundane as wanting to keep their jobs, or their
ability to speak at partisan or government-sponsored conferences, or
being able to get grants for their research, they're compromised.

&gt;<i> If you can do better brainstorming. There might be limits. Small group might
</I>&gt;<i> be unable to reach the variability of public.
</I>
True, you might miss something, but only very rarely anything really
important.  Given the efficiency tradeoff, again, an imperfect
decision rendered quickly and efficiently is far better than a
decision that considers all the options but that either doesn't get
made or is subject to corruption because the only people willing to
pursue it to the end have those conflicts of interest.  I'm not
proposing 3 or 4 people come up with the ideas that the 10 million
people of NY city will vote on, but you're not going to miss much if
100 people generate and evaluate the ideas. Requiring, or even
allowing, tens of thousands to become involved in the decision at this
level is just very inefficient use of very limited resources (i.e.,
the average citizen's time and attention).  10,000 people contributing
is basically a way of ensuring the status quo because it gives the
*appearance* of &quot;my input really matters&quot; whereas the actual decision
will be made by the same SDAPs that make all the decisions now because
10,000 is not nearly enough to ensure that you're actually assessing
&quot;the will of The People&quot;.

&gt;<i> The problem of noise is not serious in allourideas. More over it can be
</I>&gt;<i> reduced in the future. E.g. You may easily drop some last options after some
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>
Who decides, and using what information?  The only two I see are 1)
having a junta make the decision or 2) using the prioritization
determined in the construction phase pass directly through.  Both are
subject to the same prejudices and conflicts of interests that plague
our current misrepresentative-based systems.  We don't need &quot;fat
tails&quot;, we need organize the information such that *everyone* can take
a few minutes (not hours, but not seconds) to make an informed
decision and then register that decision by casting an vote.
  Regards,
    Scott
