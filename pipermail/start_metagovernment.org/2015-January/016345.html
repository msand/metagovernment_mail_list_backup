i don't see any potential for disruption.
The blockchain is a technology that enables all kinds of services that were
never possible before.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More specific, the best practices of collaboration in the sense which is

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Main problem with proxies is that it's empowering certain individuals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; than others, their vote counts for a greater amount if individuals are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; submitting their voice to others. You argue against this notion at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> times but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; promote it at others I feel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the difference is the context: The main problem with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representative government isn't representation per se, it's that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type of people who *want* to be representatives are generally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inherently unfit to do so (because almost all of them are SDAPs).  So
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we don't need to eliminate representation from our repertoire, we just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to find a way to ensure that those representatives are chosen by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> true merit and representativeness rather than because they crave power
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and know how to game the system to get it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Proxies make people more susceptible to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; corruption, they become the obvious target for bribery if they have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; following. I see this as dangerous and think that individuals should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; be held accountable for their own votes, never passing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responsibility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; off to someone else. While this might lesson the overall votes cast it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ensures that the votes are truly theirs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But by imposing this burden you're right back at the SDAP problem:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Most people are just too busy or are uninterested in the details to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cast an informed vote on most issues, so you end up with government by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the self-selected few.  I actually don't have any data to back up my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> claim that this self-selected sample is highly correlated with SDAP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> characteristics (e.g., no one's done a study I can find on personality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> characteristics of voters vs. non-voters), but I do know that it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correlated with income and that income is highly correlated with SDAP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> characteristics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Don't know if you've read the &quot;Matchism&quot; upgrade of &quot;The Plan&quot;, but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> includes a couple of additional features that address this.  The first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is a two-phase voting process, where the closing date for proxies is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the day before the final tally and everyone who's designated a proxy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gets an email that says &quot;here's the way you're going to vote unless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you go in and manually change it&quot;.  This seems to me solve the &quot;stand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behind your vote&quot; legitimacy problem, and has the additional benefit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that that email will also contain a running tally of the votes up to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that point so that these semi-passive voters will get a clue that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is a tight decision and that it's probably worth their time to do a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little more research to make an informed vote.  The second features is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a weighted list of proxies, which will distribute the load and so make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it harder to game the system by bribing/influencing a few key people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm currently working on the design for selecting proxies.  Certainly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people will be able to pick them directly from posts they've made or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by comparing a potential proxy's voting record with their own, but I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also considering running a mini-Big Five personality test and matching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on that.  I'd use something like the survey on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.politicalcompass.org/">http://www.politicalcompass.org/</A> (which is interesting and I highly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recommend exploring that site), but don't want someone picking a proxy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using a rule like &quot;he's a conservative and I'm a conservative too&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because &quot;representativeness&quot; is a little more nuanced than that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The current version is up now at matchism.org, and the mailing lists
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are even (finally) working and I invite people to join them.  But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unfortunately I'm going back to Taiwan on Wednesday for 3 weeks and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> won't be able to fully participate until I get back...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Priority listings as I understand it. The general public proposes goals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; they would like to see accomplished and rank them in order of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> importance for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; them personally. Can anyone submit a goal? How are they published if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 100,000 asking for things. Then the managers, that the public has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previously
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; hired, come up with solutions to those requests of how to achieve best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; results. Then the public choose which plan they like best by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prioritizing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; again for each goal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right: I'm not exactly sure how the winnowing-down process works, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainly everyone needs to be able to add a goal.  This gets back to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the OP, the problem being that in that system it's all one phase
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (establishing the list and prioritizing it are done at the same time).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My sense is that the refining process will be less important because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it will be done repeatedly and eventually a good set of goals will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventually just emerge regardless of who does the refining or how it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done.  At least at first, though, I'm thinking the Moderators will do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm curious where the discussion aspect comes in? Is there any way for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; public to alter a managers solution, tweak it slightly, or call them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; some oversight? If so how does that process work?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is definitely a two phase process, the first phase being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> review//comment/questioning of the proposal which will be done by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people who are most interested in the area.  The second is a public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote that will *use* that record of commentary to help them make their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Also what happens if two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; solutions to the same problem are presented and gain equal votes, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; do we go with?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure yet how to deal with this &quot;forking&quot; of proposals.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Certainly we don't want to pass more than one per area up to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting phase, but how the best one gets picked and indeed how any of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them are flagged as being ready to pass up to the voting phase I'm not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as clear on yet.  Some of these things I'm sure we won't be able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> firm up completely until I get an actual prototype up and we can start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Seems like you advocate a select group determining solutions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and then letting the public vote on which ever plan they think is best.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; feel this gives more power to the chosen mangers to draft tricky
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solutions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that include or omit select facts that could help direct a particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agenda
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; which the public might not be able to interfere with appropriately. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; associate this to the bills that get passed in our current government
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; are compromises, the bill might solve the initial problem but include
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; stipulations that we have to go along with if we want the initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; solved. How do you intend to counter that?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Smart commentator!  I don't know if you read Slashdot or Reddit but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm regularly amazed at how insightful and persuasive some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comments are.  My hunch and hope is that if a proposer (who, yes, will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usually be the Managers) tries to put something tricky in a proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it will get caught and that it will never even make it out of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evaluation phase.  And if it does, that a highly rated critical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comment or two will cause it to go down in flames at the final vote.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My fear is actually the opposite: Compromise is a necessary component
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of governing and we may find that *nothing* gets passed because the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> criticisms will be so much better than the proposals themselves.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Certainly what does pass will be vastly better that what we have for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> laws/regulations/policies now: I don't know if you've read your state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statutes or municipal codes, but at least here (in Colorado) they're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really bad (poorly and confusingly written (by lawyers), with logical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flaws you could drive a bus through and lots of ambiguity because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they're built on common law with all of its assumptions).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm much more pro public involvement at all levels to ensure no punches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; pulled by people who are setting up the solutions. I also think there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ways to organize effectively, which I can get into later. I'd like to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; understand your vision first though Scott if you would indulge me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm all for the *ability* for the public to participate until the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> final vote, and for making as easy (and even fun, if that's possible)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for them to do so.  I'm pretty set on using professionals for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> execution/implementation, though, because that's the point at which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;too many cooks&quot; becomes a problem and not a benefit.  If they want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change the execution, they need to start back at the beginning and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pass a new law/policy that does a better job of specifying exactly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what they wanted.  I'd like to see your organizing principles, though,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially how they balance time-requirements with SDAP control.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Regards,
