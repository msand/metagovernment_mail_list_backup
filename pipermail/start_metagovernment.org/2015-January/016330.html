<PRE>As I've expressed before, I'm not a big fan of wikis.  Not sure if
this is a philosophical or practical objection, but it has been my
experience that in all cases there are a few &quot;overachievers&quot; that end
up getting their way in the end.  You see this clearly in the &quot;fat
tails&quot; reported in the paper.  The problem of course being that those
&quot;overachievers&quot; sometimes are ideologues (who are often just idiots!)
and sometimes have undisclosed conflicts of interest.

I think Figure 7 is where the rubber hits the road in this paper, and
I think it shows that while there were a handful of ideas the public
came up with that weren't on the &quot;seed&quot; list, the seed stuff on
average was of higher quality.  Seems to me the easier solution is
therefore to have better brainstorming up front (i.e., better &quot;seeds&quot;,
perhaps from pilot studies) and provide an easy way for the public to
just rank them rather than turning the public loose on a wiki.
Participation would therefore end up being much higher overall, and
you'd end up with a much more balanced picture of what The People
really want.

Thanks for posting this as it's actually something I've been thinking
a lot about as part of how to organize the &quot;Goals&quot; section of my
system.  The way I see it there are actually two phases in the
governing process, the first being this sort of &quot;collect and
prioritize everything&quot; and the second being &quot;write and approve the
actual policies/rules/regulations/laws&quot;.  My conclusion is that The
People are really only useful for the second halves of each of those
(they set the priorities and approve the laws) and that there needs to
be a dedicated group (in my system the Moderators and the Managers)
who do the collating of the data and actual writing of the proposals.
Otherwise you end with a huge amount of noise that only the
overachievers will be willing to deal with.  You can see examples of
this in that paper where most of the citizen proposals (and almost all
of the &quot;education&quot; proposals) are fluff with few if any actionable
items.  Allowing people to propose goals (or vote for people who state
they share goals) like &quot;lower taxes&quot; or &quot;more money for education&quot; is
just a bad way to organize a government.  Instead they should have be
specific, as in &quot;taxes should be 28% of GDP&quot; and &quot;Education should get
12% of revenue&quot;.
  Regards,
    Scott
