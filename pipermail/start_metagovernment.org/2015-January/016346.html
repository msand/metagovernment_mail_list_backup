I guess that's evidence for my claim that there's a pretty low threshold
for how much work is too much for people to do.  If we can't even get
people who are presumably highly interested in the subject to read about
it, what chance do we have of getting them to read about truly boring stuff
like tax rates and road improvements?

&gt;<i> Just to let you know one thing. The &quot;system&quot; that enables all the people
</I>to co-govern the world is already being built.
&gt;<i> On a very general level, it's called &quot;the internet&quot;, but more specific
</I>it's in bleeding edge technologies, like:
&gt;<i> - torrents
</I>&gt;<i> - blockchain
</I>&gt;<i>    - namecoin (one example: onename.com)
</I>&gt;<i>    - bitcoin
</I>&gt;<i>    - ethereum (ethereum.org)
</I>&gt;<i> and lots of other p2p techologies, that enable new kinds of
</I>decentralised/distributed applications.
&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't see what any of those things have to do with creating a
government.  None of them have anything to do with decisionmaking...

&gt;<i> More specific, the best practices of collaboration in the sense which is
</I>often discussed here is happening RIGHT NOW in a place called:
&gt;<i> GITHUB.COM
</I>&gt;<i> ...register right now in this VERY AWESOME social network and try it our
</I>yourself :-)

Github is a source code control system, not social media.  Some people use
it for that, but they're software developers, a group that has pretty odd
habits in general.

&gt;<i> No longer hiding behind abstract talk, but instead START USING it to
</I>learn the ways of collaboration.
&gt;<i> The &quot;user interaction&quot; model of github, combined with the new emerging
</I>technologies mentioned above, will create the freedom we need. It's just a
matter of time and its co-created by all the participants.
&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, please explain what any of that has to do with decisionmaking.  Is
there support for voting or rating of proposals? Not AFAIK.
  Regards,
    Scott
