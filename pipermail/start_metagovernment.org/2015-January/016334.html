<PRE>On Sun, Jan 11, 2015 at 10:45 PM, Reid Millerd &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">mrpdublin at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> Main problem with proxies is that it's empowering certain individuals more

</I>&gt;<i> submitting their voice to others. You argue against this notion at times but
</I>&gt;<i> promote it at others I feel.
</I>
I think the difference is the context: The main problem with
representative government isn't representation per se, it's that the
type of people who *want* to be representatives are generally
inherently unfit to do so (because almost all of them are SDAPs).  So
we don't need to eliminate representation from our repertoire, we just
need to find a way to ensure that those representatives are chosen by
true merit and representativeness rather than because they crave power
and know how to game the system to get it.

&gt;<i> Proxies make people more susceptible to
</I>&gt;<i> corruption, they become the obvious target for bribery if they have a large
</I>&gt;<i> following. I see this as dangerous and think that individuals should always
</I>&gt;<i> be held accountable for their own votes, never passing the responsibility
</I>&gt;<i> off to someone else. While this might lesson the overall votes cast it
</I>&gt;<i> ensures that the votes are truly theirs.
</I>
But by imposing this burden you're right back at the SDAP problem:
Most people are just too busy or are uninterested in the details to
cast an informed vote on most issues, so you end up with government by
the self-selected few.  I actually don't have any data to back up my
claim that this self-selected sample is highly correlated with SDAP
characteristics (e.g., no one's done a study I can find on personality
characteristics of voters vs. non-voters), but I do know that it is
correlated with income and that income is highly correlated with SDAP
characteristics.

Don't know if you've read the &quot;Matchism&quot; upgrade of &quot;The Plan&quot;, but it
includes a couple of additional features that address this.  The first
is a two-phase voting process, where the closing date for proxies is
the day before the final tally and everyone who's designated a proxy
gets an email that says &quot;here's the way you're going to vote unless
you go in and manually change it&quot;.  This seems to me solve the &quot;stand
behind your vote&quot; legitimacy problem, and has the additional benefit
that that email will also contain a running tally of the votes up to
that point so that these semi-passive voters will get a clue that it
is a tight decision and that it's probably worth their time to do a
little more research to make an informed vote.  The second features is
a weighted list of proxies, which will distribute the load and so make
it harder to game the system by bribing/influencing a few key people.

I'm currently working on the design for selecting proxies.  Certainly
people will be able to pick them directly from posts they've made or
by comparing a potential proxy's voting record with their own, but I'm
also considering running a mini-Big Five personality test and matching
based on that.  I'd use something like the survey on
<A HREF="http://www.politicalcompass.org/">http://www.politicalcompass.org/</A> (which is interesting and I highly
recommend exploring that site), but don't want someone picking a proxy
using a rule like &quot;he's a conservative and I'm a conservative too&quot;
because &quot;representativeness&quot; is a little more nuanced than that.

The current version is up now at matchism.org, and the mailing lists
are even (finally) working and I invite people to join them.  But
unfortunately I'm going back to Taiwan on Wednesday for 3 weeks and
won't be able to fully participate until I get back...

&gt;<i> Priority listings as I understand it. The general public proposes goals that
</I>&gt;<i> they would like to see accomplished and rank them in order of importance for
</I>&gt;<i> them personally. Can anyone submit a goal? How are they published if you get
</I>&gt;<i> 100,000 asking for things. Then the managers, that the public has previously
</I>&gt;<i> hired, come up with solutions to those requests of how to achieve best
</I>&gt;<i> results. Then the public choose which plan they like best by prioritizing
</I>&gt;<i> again for each goal.
</I>
Right: I'm not exactly sure how the winnowing-down process works, but
certainly everyone needs to be able to add a goal.  This gets back to
the OP, the problem being that in that system it's all one phase
(establishing the list and prioritizing it are done at the same time).
My sense is that the refining process will be less important because
it will be done repeatedly and eventually a good set of goals will
eventually just emerge regardless of who does the refining or how it's
done.  At least at first, though, I'm thinking the Moderators will do
it.

&gt;<i> I'm curious where the discussion aspect comes in? Is there any way for the
</I>&gt;<i> public to alter a managers solution, tweak it slightly, or call them out on
</I>&gt;<i> some oversight? If so how does that process work?
</I>
It is definitely a two phase process, the first phase being
review//comment/questioning of the proposal which will be done by the
people who are most interested in the area.  The second is a public
vote that will *use* that record of commentary to help them make their
decision.

&gt;<i> Also what happens if two
</I>&gt;<i> solutions to the same problem are presented and gain equal votes, which one
</I>&gt;<i> do we go with?
</I>
I'm not sure yet how to deal with this &quot;forking&quot; of proposals.
Certainly we don't want to pass more than one per area up to the
voting phase, but how the best one gets picked and indeed how any of
them are flagged as being ready to pass up to the voting phase I'm not
as clear on yet.  Some of these things I'm sure we won't be able to
firm up completely until I get an actual prototype up and we can start
trying things.

&gt;<i> Seems like you advocate a select group determining solutions
</I>&gt;<i> and then letting the public vote on which ever plan they think is best. I
</I>&gt;<i> feel this gives more power to the chosen mangers to draft tricky solutions
</I>&gt;<i> that include or omit select facts that could help direct a particular agenda
</I>&gt;<i> which the public might not be able to interfere with appropriately. I
</I>&gt;<i> associate this to the bills that get passed in our current government that
</I>&gt;<i> are compromises, the bill might solve the initial problem but include
</I>&gt;<i> stipulations that we have to go along with if we want the initial problem
</I>&gt;<i> solved. How do you intend to counter that?
</I>
Smart commentator!  I don't know if you read Slashdot or Reddit but
I'm regularly amazed at how insightful and persuasive some of the
comments are.  My hunch and hope is that if a proposer (who, yes, will
usually be the Managers) tries to put something tricky in a proposal
that it will get caught and that it will never even make it out of the
evaluation phase.  And if it does, that a highly rated critical
comment or two will cause it to go down in flames at the final vote.

My fear is actually the opposite: Compromise is a necessary component
of governing and we may find that *nothing* gets passed because the
criticisms will be so much better than the proposals themselves.
Certainly what does pass will be vastly better that what we have for
laws/regulations/policies now: I don't know if you've read your state
statutes or municipal codes, but at least here (in Colorado) they're
really bad (poorly and confusingly written (by lawyers), with logical
flaws you could drive a bus through and lots of ambiguity because
they're built on common law with all of its assumptions).

&gt;<i> I'm much more pro public involvement at all levels to ensure no punches are
</I>&gt;<i> pulled by people who are setting up the solutions. I also think there are
</I>&gt;<i> ways to organize effectively, which I can get into later. I'd like to fully
</I>&gt;<i> understand your vision first though Scott if you would indulge me. Cheers
</I>
I'm all for the *ability* for the public to participate until the
final vote, and for making as easy (and even fun, if that's possible)
for them to do so.  I'm pretty set on using professionals for
execution/implementation, though, because that's the point at which
&quot;too many cooks&quot; becomes a problem and not a benefit.  If they want to
change the execution, they need to start back at the beginning and
pass a new law/policy that does a better job of specifying exactly
what they wanted.  I'd like to see your organizing principles, though,
especially how they balance time-requirements with SDAP control.
  Regards,
    Scott
