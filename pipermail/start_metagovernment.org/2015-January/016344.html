<PRE>Hi everybody,

blockchain is good. What do you say to this
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Bank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Bank</A>
?
It is not protected from national governments (it may be, if it grows 
bigger), but it gives the things that is blockchain unable to provide 
for a good price.

Regards
m.

</I>&gt;<i> and lots of other p2p techologies, that enable new kinds of

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Main problem with proxies is that it's empowering certain
</I>&gt;<i>     individuals more
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; than others, their vote counts for a greater amount if
</I>&gt;<i>     individuals are
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; submitting their voice to others. You argue against this notion
</I>&gt;<i>     at times but
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; promote it at others I feel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I think the difference is the context: The main problem with
</I>&gt;<i>     representative government isn't representation per se, it's that the
</I>&gt;<i>     type of people who *want* to be representatives are generally
</I>&gt;<i>     inherently unfit to do so (because almost all of them are SDAPs).  So
</I>&gt;<i>     we don't need to eliminate representation from our repertoire, we just
</I>&gt;<i>     need to find a way to ensure that those representatives are chosen by
</I>&gt;<i>     true merit and representativeness rather than because they crave power
</I>&gt;<i>     and know how to game the system to get it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Proxies make people more susceptible to
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; corruption, they become the obvious target for bribery if they
</I>&gt;<i>     have a large
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; following. I see this as dangerous and think that individuals
</I>&gt;<i>     should always
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; be held accountable for their own votes, never passing the
</I>&gt;<i>     responsibility
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; off to someone else. While this might lesson the overall votes
</I>&gt;<i>     cast it
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; ensures that the votes are truly theirs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     But by imposing this burden you're right back at the SDAP problem:
</I>&gt;<i>     Most people are just too busy or are uninterested in the details to
</I>&gt;<i>     cast an informed vote on most issues, so you end up with government by
</I>&gt;<i>     the self-selected few.  I actually don't have any data to back up my
</I>&gt;<i>     claim that this self-selected sample is highly correlated with SDAP
</I>&gt;<i>     characteristics (e.g., no one's done a study I can find on personality
</I>&gt;<i>     characteristics of voters vs. non-voters), but I do know that it is
</I>&gt;<i>     correlated with income and that income is highly correlated with SDAP
</I>&gt;<i>     characteristics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Don't know if you've read the &quot;Matchism&quot; upgrade of &quot;The Plan&quot;, but it
</I>&gt;<i>     includes a couple of additional features that address this. The first
</I>&gt;<i>     is a two-phase voting process, where the closing date for proxies is
</I>&gt;<i>     the day before the final tally and everyone who's designated a proxy
</I>&gt;<i>     gets an email that says &quot;here's the way you're going to vote unless
</I>&gt;<i>     you go in and manually change it&quot;.  This seems to me solve the &quot;stand
</I>&gt;<i>     behind your vote&quot; legitimacy problem, and has the additional benefit
</I>&gt;<i>     that that email will also contain a running tally of the votes up to
</I>&gt;<i>     that point so that these semi-passive voters will get a clue that it
</I>&gt;<i>     is a tight decision and that it's probably worth their time to do a
</I>&gt;<i>     little more research to make an informed vote.  The second features is
</I>&gt;<i>     a weighted list of proxies, which will distribute the load and so make
</I>&gt;<i>     it harder to game the system by bribing/influencing a few key people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm currently working on the design for selecting proxies. Certainly
</I>&gt;<i>     people will be able to pick them directly from posts they've made or
</I>&gt;<i>     by comparing a potential proxy's voting record with their own, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i>     also considering running a mini-Big Five personality test and matching
</I>&gt;<i>     based on that.  I'd use something like the survey on
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://www.politicalcompass.org/">http://www.politicalcompass.org/</A> (which is interesting and I highly
</I>&gt;<i>     recommend exploring that site), but don't want someone picking a proxy
</I>&gt;<i>     using a rule like &quot;he's a conservative and I'm a conservative too&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     because &quot;representativeness&quot; is a little more nuanced than that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The current version is up now at matchism.org
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;<A HREF="http://matchism.org">http://matchism.org</A>&gt;, and the mailing lists
</I>&gt;<i>     are even (finally) working and I invite people to join them.  But
</I>&gt;<i>     unfortunately I'm going back to Taiwan on Wednesday for 3 weeks and
</I>&gt;<i>     won't be able to fully participate until I get back...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Priority listings as I understand it. The general public
</I>&gt;<i>     proposes goals that
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; they would like to see accomplished and rank them in order of
</I>&gt;<i>     importance for
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; them personally. Can anyone submit a goal? How are they
</I>&gt;<i>     published if you get
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; 100,000 asking for things. Then the managers, that the public
</I>&gt;<i>     has previously
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; hired, come up with solutions to those requests of how to
</I>&gt;<i>     achieve best
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; results. Then the public choose which plan they like best by
</I>&gt;<i>     prioritizing
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; again for each goal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Right: I'm not exactly sure how the winnowing-down process works, but
</I>&gt;<i>     certainly everyone needs to be able to add a goal.  This gets back to
</I>&gt;<i>     the OP, the problem being that in that system it's all one phase
</I>&gt;<i>     (establishing the list and prioritizing it are done at the same time).
</I>&gt;<i>     My sense is that the refining process will be less important because
</I>&gt;<i>     it will be done repeatedly and eventually a good set of goals will
</I>&gt;<i>     eventually just emerge regardless of who does the refining or how it's
</I>&gt;<i>     done.  At least at first, though, I'm thinking the Moderators will do
</I>&gt;<i>     it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; I'm curious where the discussion aspect comes in? Is there any
</I>&gt;<i>     way for the
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; public to alter a managers solution, tweak it slightly, or call
</I>&gt;<i>     them out on
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; some oversight? If so how does that process work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It is definitely a two phase process, the first phase being
</I>&gt;<i>     review//comment/questioning of the proposal which will be done by the
</I>&gt;<i>     people who are most interested in the area.  The second is a public
</I>&gt;<i>     vote that will *use* that record of commentary to help them make their
</I>&gt;<i>     decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Also what happens if two
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; solutions to the same problem are presented and gain equal
</I>&gt;<i>     votes, which one
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; do we go with?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm not sure yet how to deal with this &quot;forking&quot; of proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>     Certainly we don't want to pass more than one per area up to the
</I>&gt;<i>     voting phase, but how the best one gets picked and indeed how any of
</I>&gt;<i>     them are flagged as being ready to pass up to the voting phase I'm not
</I>&gt;<i>     as clear on yet.  Some of these things I'm sure we won't be able to
</I>&gt;<i>     firm up completely until I get an actual prototype up and we can start
</I>&gt;<i>     trying things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Seems like you advocate a select group determining solutions
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; and then letting the public vote on which ever plan they think
</I>&gt;<i>     is best. I
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; feel this gives more power to the chosen mangers to draft tricky
</I>&gt;<i>     solutions
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; that include or omit select facts that could help direct a
</I>&gt;<i>     particular agenda
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; which the public might not be able to interfere with
</I>&gt;<i>     appropriately. I
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; associate this to the bills that get passed in our current
</I>&gt;<i>     government that
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; are compromises, the bill might solve the initial problem but
</I>&gt;<i>     include
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; stipulations that we have to go along with if we want the
</I>&gt;<i>     initial problem
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; solved. How do you intend to counter that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Smart commentator!  I don't know if you read Slashdot or Reddit but
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm regularly amazed at how insightful and persuasive some of the
</I>&gt;<i>     comments are.  My hunch and hope is that if a proposer (who, yes, will
</I>&gt;<i>     usually be the Managers) tries to put something tricky in a proposal
</I>&gt;<i>     that it will get caught and that it will never even make it out of the
</I>&gt;<i>     evaluation phase.  And if it does, that a highly rated critical
</I>&gt;<i>     comment or two will cause it to go down in flames at the final vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My fear is actually the opposite: Compromise is a necessary component
</I>&gt;<i>     of governing and we may find that *nothing* gets passed because the
</I>&gt;<i>     criticisms will be so much better than the proposals themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>     Certainly what does pass will be vastly better that what we have for
</I>&gt;<i>     laws/regulations/policies now: I don't know if you've read your state
</I>&gt;<i>     statutes or municipal codes, but at least here (in Colorado) they're
</I>&gt;<i>     really bad (poorly and confusingly written (by lawyers), with logical
</I>&gt;<i>     flaws you could drive a bus through and lots of ambiguity because
</I>&gt;<i>     they're built on common law with all of its assumptions).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; I'm much more pro public involvement at all levels to ensure no
</I>&gt;<i>     punches are
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; pulled by people who are setting up the solutions. I also think
</I>&gt;<i>     there are
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; ways to organize effectively, which I can get into later. I'd
</I>&gt;<i>     like to fully
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; understand your vision first though Scott if you would indulge
</I>&gt;<i>     me. Cheers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm all for the *ability* for the public to participate until the
</I>&gt;<i>     final vote, and for making as easy (and even fun, if that's possible)
</I>&gt;<i>     for them to do so.  I'm pretty set on using professionals for
</I>&gt;<i>     execution/implementation, though, because that's the point at which
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;too many cooks&quot; becomes a problem and not a benefit.  If they want to
</I>&gt;<i>     change the execution, they need to start back at the beginning and
</I>&gt;<i>     pass a new law/policy that does a better job of specifying exactly
</I>&gt;<i>     what they wanted.  I'd like to see your organizing principles, though,
</I>&gt;<i>     especially how they balance time-requirements with SDAP control.
</I>&gt;<i>       Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>         Scott
