<PRE>I agree that wikis can be hazardous as it enables the most persistent user
to get their way in the end. However I also have issue with the notion of
proxies and priority listings that you Scott seem intent on pursuing. This
could be due to my misunderstanding on the topic so please correct where
ever I veer from truth.

Main problem with proxies is that it's empowering certain individuals more
than others, their vote counts for a greater amount if individuals are
submitting their voice to others. You argue against this notion at times
but promote it at others I feel. Proxies make people more susceptible to
corruption, they become the obvious target for bribery if they have a large
following. I see this as dangerous and think that individuals should always
be held accountable for their own votes, never passing the responsibility
off to someone else. While this might lesson the overall votes cast it
ensures that the votes are truly theirs.

Priority listings as I understand it. The general public proposes goals
that they would like to see accomplished and rank them in order of
importance for them personally. Can anyone submit a goal? How are they
published if you get 100,000 asking for things. Then the managers, that the
public has previously hired, come up with solutions to those requests of
how to achieve best results. Then the public choose which plan they like
best by prioritizing again for each goal.

I'm curious where the discussion aspect comes in? Is there any way for the
public to alter a managers solution, tweak it slightly, or call them out on
some oversight? If so how does that process work? Also what happens if two
solutions to the same problem are presented and gain equal votes, which one
do we go with? Seems like you advocate a select group determining solutions
and then letting the public vote on which ever plan they think is best. I
feel this gives more power to the chosen mangers to draft tricky solutions
that include or omit select facts that could help direct a particular
agenda which the public might not be able to interfere with appropriately.
I associate this to the bills that get passed in our current government
that are compromises, the bill might solve the initial problem but include
stipulations that we have to go along with if we want the initial problem
solved. How do you intend to counter that?

I'm much more pro public involvement at all levels to ensure no punches are
pulled by people who are setting up the solutions. I also think there are
ways to organize effectively, which I can get into later. I'd like to fully
understand your vision first though Scott if you would indulge me. Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not in all cases, why would you write your book then?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I believe that the &quot;fat heads&quot; (or tails) make their opinions in their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allourideas matrix more precise. From what you say I have the notion,
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you think that they have more votes, is it so ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If by &quot;votes&quot; you mean &quot;power&quot;, yes.  A conflict of interest is a very
</I>&gt;<i> specific term, legally speaking.  In most cases it means that someone
</I>&gt;<i> personally financially benefits from their actions.  The farther you
</I>&gt;<i> get from the one-person-one-vote ideal, the more common these
</I>&gt;<i> arrangements become.  In the NY example, I can just see the
</I>&gt;<i> dockworkers jumping all over that &quot;tie ships to the electric grid&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> thing, and teachers jumping all over the &quot;more money for schools&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> thing because both groups will get paid more directly as a result of
</I>&gt;<i> pushing those proposals.  There should be no problem with them
</I>&gt;<i> proposing these things or arguing for them, but if you use the results
</I>&gt;<i> of this first phase to set priorities (which is what anything other
</I>&gt;<i> than a direct mass vote requires), you've designed an inherently
</I>&gt;<i> corrupt system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most of us live with undisclosed conflicts IMHO, there is a talk by
</I>&gt;<i> Chomsky
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about it.

</I>&gt;<i> I definitely relate to his concerns about intellectuals and this is
</I>&gt;<i> partially what inspires me to take my project on.  He calls it
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;doublethink&quot; (I usually call it compartmentalization), but the idea
</I>&gt;<i> is that people in situations where their prejudices or their
</I>&gt;<i> livelihoods are being threatened simply ignore or deny the facts
</I>&gt;<i> rather than work through the conflict to find real solutions.  He also
</I>&gt;<i> makes a good point that the existing systems work as filters such that
</I>&gt;<i> people who would be willing and able to work on these kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> conflicts are just weeded out.  I certainly don't expect anyone in
</I>&gt;<i> power now, and that includes anybody in an academic position
</I>&gt;<i> (particularly political scientists), to pursue anything like this
</I>&gt;<i> because they have this kind inherent conflict of interest.  Even if
</I>&gt;<i> it's something as mundane as wanting to keep their jobs, or their
</I>&gt;<i> ability to speak at partisan or government-sponsored conferences, or
</I>&gt;<i> being able to get grants for their research, they're compromised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you can do better brainstorming. There might be limits. Small group
</I>&gt;<i> might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be unable to reach the variability of public.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True, you might miss something, but only very rarely anything really
</I>&gt;<i> important.  Given the efficiency tradeoff, again, an imperfect
</I>&gt;<i> decision rendered quickly and efficiently is far better than a
</I>&gt;<i> decision that considers all the options but that either doesn't get
</I>&gt;<i> made or is subject to corruption because the only people willing to
</I>&gt;<i> pursue it to the end have those conflicts of interest.  I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> proposing 3 or 4 people come up with the ideas that the 10 million
</I>&gt;<i> people of NY city will vote on, but you're not going to miss much if
</I>&gt;<i> 100 people generate and evaluate the ideas. Requiring, or even
</I>&gt;<i> allowing, tens of thousands to become involved in the decision at this
</I>&gt;<i> level is just very inefficient use of very limited resources (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> the average citizen's time and attention).  10,000 people contributing
</I>&gt;<i> is basically a way of ensuring the status quo because it gives the
</I>&gt;<i> *appearance* of &quot;my input really matters&quot; whereas the actual decision
</I>&gt;<i> will be made by the same SDAPs that make all the decisions now because
</I>&gt;<i> 10,000 is not nearly enough to ensure that you're actually assessing
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the will of The People&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem of noise is not serious in allourideas. More over it can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reduced in the future. E.g. You may easily drop some last options after
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who decides, and using what information?  The only two I see are 1)
</I>&gt;<i> having a junta make the decision or 2) using the prioritization
</I>&gt;<i> determined in the construction phase pass directly through.  Both are
</I>&gt;<i> subject to the same prejudices and conflicts of interests that plague
</I>&gt;<i> our current misrepresentative-based systems.  We don't need &quot;fat
</I>&gt;<i> tails&quot;, we need organize the information such that *everyone* can take
</I>&gt;<i> a few minutes (not hours, but not seconds) to make an informed
</I>&gt;<i> decision and then register that decision by casting an vote.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
