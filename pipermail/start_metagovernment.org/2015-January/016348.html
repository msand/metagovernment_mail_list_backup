Thanks for the reference, but unfortunately I didn't find any of the stuff
on that site very enlightening.   There's lots of handwaving about how
&quot;workers uniting&quot; will solve all of our problems, but almost nothing about
how any of the hard problems (particularly the kinds of income
redistribution that are necessary to provide for schools, the disabled,
retirement pensions, etc.) will be solved.

And it all has a kind of religious feel to it, like you're supposed to take
all these proposals on faith without examining any of the details or
fundamental assumptions very carefully.  There were a few insightful
comments about communism in there, particularly the need to go *through* an
anarchist phase before true communism can be achieved.  But even this was
oddly reminiscent, albeit completely contradictory, to what Trotsky had to
say about the need to go through a bourgeois phase to get from peasant
farmers to communism.  Which is it?

So I'm still stuck with the basic question: How does any form of anarchism
really deal with any sort of wealth inequality other than handwaving about
how it won't ever develop if the participants are truly motivated to
prioritize the enterprise over their individual preferences?
  Regards,
    Scott
