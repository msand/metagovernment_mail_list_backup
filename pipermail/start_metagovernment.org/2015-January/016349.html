Agreed: It's an empirical question.  We'll just have to build the system
first, then see how it gets used, then adjust accordingly.

&gt;<i> Everyone will surely participate at their own level, I think we'd see
</I>interest increase substantially with the realization that there's more
weigh behind their vote now though. Proxies would not be necessary if 80%
of the public was participating. I think the key to getting this number up
is to make it easy to become informed so people only have to dedicate 10
mins of the day towards it. Proposals refined into easily digestible chucks
for voting saves much of the hassle and would increase participation.
&gt;<i>
</I>
A worthy goal, even for those who are fully committed (we surely can't
afford to waste even any of their time).  And maybe eventually we *will* be
able to count on 10 minutes of work from everyone every day.  I'm just
skeptical that we can get the project off the ground in the first place
with this assumption.  Hence the need for proxies.  If they later become
unnecessary, people just won't use them (i.e., it's the better to have them
and not need them, than vice versa).

(big snip)

&gt;<i> The way I envision doing this as well as avoiding granting managers the
</I>ability to exclusively draft proposals. Is to simply allow the public to
draft proposals, individuals that are passionate about a particular subject
can propose their own proposals so it's less an &quot;I want this, make it
happen&quot; mindset but rather a create your own future outlook. I realize this
is a perfect breeding ground for these SDAP's but the process of drafting
would take some work with minimum requirements that would need to be filled
out to address the basic breakdown off the bat, a minor deterrent and tool
to reveal any sinister activity in the process. The dedicated individuals
driven to change will go through the work to fully explain their idea for
the masses though.

But I think your proposal about &quot;passionate individuals&quot; doing the work is
overlooking a fundamental fact: The most passionate source of proposals are
going to be corporations.   Which is who writes a lot of the stuff that at
least the US federal and state congresses ends up rubber stamping far too
often.  Which means the Managers are actually going to be *less* self
interested than the &quot;passionate individuals&quot; and so less likely to try to
game the system (they'll still sometimes try to do it, of course, but their
motivation is more likely to be just something that will make their jobs
easier than the kind of rent-seeking that corporations routinely engage
in).  IMHO the kind of passionate individual you're conceiving of will
rarely play a role, so the system needs to be designed to accommodate them,
but we surely can't count on them to do more than a very small part of the
heavy lifting.

    Scott
