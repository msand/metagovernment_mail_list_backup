invest in the company you work for/in, whereas under corporate capitalism
you are able to invest in any company.  Have I missed something?

~profit belongs to capital, and Marx: ~profit belongs to workers IMHO

I think I understand the pure communist case well enough: In that case
everyone collectively makes the decisions as to what to produce and the
distribution of any profit becomes straightforward because the same
organization (the State) handles that too.

But anarcho-syndicalism is a different kind of animal: In that case there
*is* no state organization responsible for all the investment choices and
distribution of profit.  Instead individuals make these choices.  My
question is, what happens when an individual wants to take the profit from
the venture they're working in and use it as capital to fund a different
venture?  Are laws passed to prevent this, or is it just up to some moral
code (i.e., religion, like the Islamic prohibition against loaning money
with interest due) to prevent it?  How does one reconcile this restriction
with the &quot;freedom&quot; the anarcho part of the philosophy is supposed to
provide?
