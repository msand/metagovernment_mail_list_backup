<PRE>Scott,

I have made some notes to you paragraphs. Still I believe that the main 
importance of AllOurIdeas is that it may be applied in current political 
environment to change it gradually. In other words I do not see the 
usual unresolved loop of conditions and results as in other methods. 
That makes it better IMHO.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;overachievers&quot; sometimes are ideologues (who are often just idiots!)
</I>&gt;<i> and sometimes have undisclosed conflicts of interest.
</I>Not in all cases, why would you write your book then?
  I believe that the &quot;fat heads&quot; (or tails) make their opinions in their 
allourideas matrix more precise. From what you say I have the notion, 
that you think that they have more votes, is it so ?
Most of us live with undisclosed conflicts IMHO, there is a talk by 
Chomsky about it.

</I>&gt;<i> I think Figure 7 is where the rubber hits the road in this paper, and
</I>&gt;<i> I think it shows that while there were a handful of ideas the public
</I>&gt;<i> came up with that weren't on the &quot;seed&quot; list, the seed stuff on
</I>&gt;<i> average was of higher quality.  Seems to me the easier solution is
</I>&gt;<i> therefore to have better brainstorming up front (i.e., better &quot;seeds&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps from pilot studies) and provide an easy way for the public to
</I>&gt;<i> just rank them rather than turning the public loose on a wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> Participation would therefore end up being much higher overall, and
</I>&gt;<i> you'd end up with a much more balanced picture of what The People
</I>&gt;<i> really want.
</I>If you can do better brainstorming. There might be limits. Small group 
might be unable to reach the variability of public.

&gt;<i> Thanks for posting this as it's actually something I've been thinking
</I>&gt;<i> a lot about as part of how to organize the &quot;Goals&quot; section of my
</I>&gt;<i> system.  The way I see it there are actually two phases in the
</I>&gt;<i> governing process, the first being this sort of &quot;collect and
</I>&gt;<i> prioritize everything&quot; and the second being &quot;write and approve the
</I>&gt;<i> actual policies/rules/regulations/laws&quot;.  My conclusion is that The
</I>&gt;<i> People are really only useful for the second halves of each of those
</I>&gt;<i> (they set the priorities and approve the laws) and that there needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be a dedicated group (in my system the Moderators and the Managers)
</I>&gt;<i> who do the collating of the data and actual writing of the proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise you end with a huge amount of noise that only the
</I>&gt;<i> overachievers will be willing to deal with.  You can see examples of
</I>&gt;<i> this in that paper where most of the citizen proposals (and almost all
</I>&gt;<i> of the &quot;education&quot; proposals) are fluff with few if any actionable
</I>&gt;<i> items.  Allowing people to propose goals (or vote for people who state
</I>&gt;<i> they share goals) like &quot;lower taxes&quot; or &quot;more money for education&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> just a bad way to organize a government.  Instead they should have be
</I>&gt;<i> specific, as in &quot;taxes should be 28% of GDP&quot; and &quot;Education should get
</I>&gt;<i> 12% of revenue&quot;.
</I>The problem of noise is not serious in allourideas. More over it can be 
reduced in the future. E.g. You may easily drop some last options after 
some time.

</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
