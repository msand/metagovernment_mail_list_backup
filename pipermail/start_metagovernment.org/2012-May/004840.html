<PRE>Greetings all,

I'm writing to solicit your thoughts and questions on draft amendments to the city charter of New York that aim to take as big a step a first step as we think we can pull off towards creating a modern-day citizen lawmaking process. &#160;This will admittedly fall short of more utopian but achievable ideas often the focus of this list, but we think it's significant nonetheless. &#160;Please note we won't be able to change the drafts once we begin circulating the petitions this summer to place them on the ballot, so now is the time for useful suggestions. &#160;The text of the Citizens' Forum amendment, which is concerned with the implementation of the internet component of our proposals, is accessible on our site

<A HREF="http://lowercased.org">http://lowercased.org</A>

via Real democracy for NYC &gt; Draft Amendnments

I apologize in advance for the density of the legal text. &#160;If you don't have the time to wade through it but have a particular concern that some consideration be included, please feel free to let us know. To spare this list long-winded explanations of legal considerations unique to lowercase d's local effort which addressing some of your comments might require, and because most of the people involved in writing our drafts are not on this list, I encourage you to share your feedback off-list, however you prefer.

Thanks!

Olaf
