<PRE>As I think about it more, Czech language is the first and almost only option here, even if I would advertise it just in English, majority will expect Czech language.(We have small minorities that know Czech, German minority is really small after 1946). I should probably just translate some more materials to Czech...



And yes, if we would have a Metagovernment main page, that would help me.

Just something short that will mention direct democracy and free software (as by fsf.org). That is what persists, I guess. And archive the wiki.



Or get another organization that would like to host the project...



Regards

m.

Well, in my experience it is particularly difficult to make meetings in more than one language. And everybody tries to understand from the beginning if a meeting will be in a language they understand or not. Any time there is some confusion, some people will not go. Said that I really think the main problem has to do with how the discussion have moved on in those ten years from when metagovernment was created.



Regards,

Pietro

Thank you. Do I understand it correctly that I should advertise just in English? Never thought about it...

Hi Michal,

I am sorry nobody came to your event.



I think many things changed in the last years and our approach has been substituted by a different, blockchain based approach. Also I rememeber the event being advertised not in English, which probably did not help.



Hope that helps,

Pietro

Hello,



the event is over, nobody came. It was pure &quot;head against the wall&quot;. And that tells us almost nothing I guess because the event in the village before had participants.



Any ideas where to go?



Cheers

m.
