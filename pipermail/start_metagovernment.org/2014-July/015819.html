I think it is impossible to &quot;UNITE&quot; all people upfront, thus i vote against
the proposal to have a majority of 65% or 80% or something else.
The whole approach is flawed.
My belief is, that oppinions are many and the best which is possible is, to
come up with a proposal and find someone to support that proposal forever,
until he decided to &quot;withdraw&quot; his support it is legit forever.

To give everyone the possibility to maintain an overview over all the
&quot;supported proposals&quot;, one maintains his own profile page, which can be
hosted by METAGOVERNMENT, but also adheres to a certain &quot;data format&quot; which
can be CRAWLED, so everyone is free to close their metagovernment hosted
profile and instead upload their proposals in that &quot;data format&quot; (I propose
a GIT REPOSITORY), to their website or github and afterwards to ADD that
new URL to the CRAWLER.

Therefore consensus can be reached among all supporters of a proposal and
its legit only amongst them.

This process will build many &quot;islands of local consensus&quot; which can then be
grown into bigger islands through discussion, eventually growing into a
planet of consensus.
