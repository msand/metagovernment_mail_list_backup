<PRE>Q - By what steps do you hope to advance the field of participatory
democracy (pd), or otherwise
achieve an outcome that is beneficial to humanity?

A - Is easy to demonstrate the unfitness of the past , recent, current
political establishment, (first step)
Is harder but not impossible to demonstrate that a participatory democracy
is beneficial to humanity, (second step)

Here at MG we discuss the how but i feel that the discussion enter into a
loop and therefore is not producing an outcome. We discuss about overplan
and we, IMHO miss to act in such structured and methodological way that
aloud to* dynamically* change the overplan if deemed necessary.

The perfect participatory democracy must be flexible to adapt to the
contest, what is good in the US may not be appropriate in Italy and the
same for many different countries, The variables are many. Certainly I
believe that as the society evolve and &quot;connect&quot; more and more the
differences will diminish in time and there will be less need of
different methodology here and there.

The set of rules each group (local,regional national etc) will set for
themselves  that can be shared will permit to federalize group to share
decision (third step) so that larger group will participate to the decision
where the interest are shared.

Therefore we can elaborate that certain policies can be elaborated if
certain shared rules are accepted.
(certain here means very little because this will come from the
participatory process and will be defined by the rules that can be shared)

I don't want to bored you with my theories but I have the strongest feeling
that this will happen naturally and automatically. Unfortunately recent
Italian political evidence show that the participatory democracy movement
can be derailed easily if fall under any leadership. Therefore IMHO, ANY pd
model, where is present even the slightest delegated feature or leadership
structure, will eventually fail.




Kind regards
Jacopo

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You have to understand first, what you can already observe in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political arena. Why do representative structures build up? Take a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pen and paper draw some smilies and get an idea how structures of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dominance build up.  Democracy is not a consensual system. It is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; civilized form of war. But besides being stable because of that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fundation, it is economically optimal.  Democracy is not only given
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; naturally. It is free and great ans superb.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Take two of your smilies and draw a circle around them. This first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; group can dominate all others. No proposals needed!! But a program
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on which one of the group acts as a politician and the other as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voter. That is all you need to know to understand democracy. Groups
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can cooperate with a coalition program. There is consensus within
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; groups and competition between them.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Grab yourself a pen and a paper, put up an amount of smilies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voluntarily on the paper, draw a line around two of such smilies to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; form a first group, and ask yourself why such group can dominate all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; others? That is decentralized dominance. Unite et impera. Ask
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yourself, what happens, if such group-buildings goes on. What ideal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structures come up? Work with contracts to get a civilized
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version. And you are fit with democracy.
