<PRE>Hi Marc,

It's interesting that qKonsens would allow that kind of customization.
Usually when a process is formalized into steps, they're hard coded.

&gt;<i>From what I understand, qKonsens &quot;stations&quot; and Metagov &quot;overplans&quot;
</I>are different.  I think stations have these characteristics:

   * The station is a group choice
   * Its steps are executed by the group
   * The scope of action may be large or small
   * The purpose of any two stations may differ; stations are used to
     further any kind of action

Metagov overplans differ as follows:

   * The overplan is an individual choice
   * Its steps are executed by the individual
   * The scope of action is always very large
   * The purpose of any two overplans is the same: to move the entire
     field of participatory democracy forward, or more generally to
     move the whole of humanity forward
     
In your work with AG Meinungsfindungstool and the German Pirates, for
instance, you hope to achieve an outcome that's helpful to humanity.
If you were to name that outcome and list the steps to it, then that
would be an overplan.

The definition was unclear before, so I re-wrote the wiki page to make
it clearer.  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan</A>

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just a short side note on this. I am not sure if I understand the concept of
</I>&gt;<i> overplans correctly, but I think the qKonsens in its final version will
</I>&gt;<i> contain a very simillar concept. The qK methodology uses the term 'Station'
</I>&gt;<i> to specify  a kind of separated steps of execution within the
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making process. This steps can be in paralell or in sequence. But
</I>&gt;<i> instead of fixing the Stations, the qK delegates the definition to each
</I>&gt;<i> discourse. The discourse then passes the defined Stations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There might be a default Station definition that could look like the below:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226;    SITUATION (problem analysis)
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226;    IDEA (possible solutions)
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226;    CONCEPT (how to implement a concrete solution)
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226;    PROGRAM (in the meaning of Program-Management, Portfolio-Management)
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226;    PROJECT (one smaler part of the Program)
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226;    ACTION (executing tasks)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Disclaimer: Because I am not the master mind behind the qKonsens, I might 
</I>&gt;<i> not have found the best explaination here. So please be gentle ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> Marc
