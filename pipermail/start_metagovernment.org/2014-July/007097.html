<PRE>I'm writing to see if we can come to consensus about how to move forward
with new text for the homepage.  It seems there have been a number of
reasonable alternatives put forward, some on Vilfredo, some on Loomio,
perhaps others that I'm not be aware of.  But I don't think there's a
shared understanding about how we'll move from a set of alternatives to one
formulation on the homepage.


A process that I don&#8217;t think works is voting alternatives up or down one at
a time (as has been attempted on Loomio).  This would be similar to asking
a child &#8220;Do you want cake?&#8221; and &#8220;Do you want ice cream?&#8221;.  The more
appropriate question is &#8220;Do you want cake *OR* ice cream?&#8221;.  The child
doesn&#8217;t get two desserts, and we can&#8217;t have more than one description on
the homepage.


So, we&#8217;ll need to decide what how to use to choose between a set of
alternatives.  I personally like the idea of ranked choice voting, and
suggested the possibility of using <A HREF="http://www.opavote.org.">http://www.opavote.org.</A>  Digging into
it, it appears suitable for our purpose, except that it&#8217;s designed for
candidates rather than documents.  To use it we might post links to the
text of all of the alternatives on the homepage, giving each a short,
descriptive name, then below that linking to the voting tool, which would
use the same descriptive names as &#8220;candidates&#8221; in the election.  The
software allows for the election to last 7 days without charge.


If we decide to pursue this approach, I&#8217;d suggest we allow 7 days to gather
all current formulations from Vilfredo, Loomio, etc. and list them on the
homepage.  Then allow 7 days for the election itself.  If we agree to this
approach, we&#8217;d have new text for the homepage within two weeks of our start
date.


What do folks think?


Cheers,
Mark-
