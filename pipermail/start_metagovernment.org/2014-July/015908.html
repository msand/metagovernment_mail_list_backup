<PRE>Hmm.  You are running a modified consensus but very very modified.

If you are a member and the group makes a valid decision then you are
personally liable for the result even if you are not participating in any
reasonable way.  You cannot have members but not be an entity.

The biggest problems I run across are interfaces between statute and custom
assuming you chose to try to limit your personal liability.

Enjoy.

</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m calling it *the Beta Council*.  The &#8220;Organization&quot; currently consists
</I>&gt;<i> of a dozen or so individuals&#8230;and hasn&#8217;t yet formed into any official
</I>&gt;<i> entity. We are just getting started.
</I>&gt;<i> Your questions and feedback are most welcome.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The Organization:*
</I>&gt;<i> This Organization (currently a non-entity) consists of those members who
</I>&gt;<i> are participating in it's development though the process of *the Beta
</I>&gt;<i> Council*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Membership:*
</I>&gt;<i> To become a member of this Organization one must receive an invitation
</I>&gt;<i> (approved by a majority of the existing members of Organization) in order
</I>&gt;<i> to register with *the Beta Council*. One's membership may be revoked at any
</I>&gt;<i> time by a majority vote of the Organization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **the Beta Council*: *
</I>&gt;<i> *the Beta Council* is a proposal introduction and approval *protocol*
</I>&gt;<i> supported by an online decision-making mechanism with a database (currently
</I>&gt;<i> being hosted on Loomio.org).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Proposals:*
</I>&gt;<i> All proposals generated by this Organization will be initiated by a member
</I>&gt;<i> (or a group of members) through *the Beta Council*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposals must be clear, concise, and itemized if lengthy. They may be
</I>&gt;<i> revised or amended [and then re-stated by the original proposer(s)] at any
</I>&gt;<i> point during the discussion phase of the process. Anytime a proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> substantially altered, the revised proposal must be re-initiated through
</I>&gt;<i> *the Beta Council* and a new quorum must then be established. The original
</I>&gt;<i> proposer(s) may revoke their proposal at anytime prior to a binding vote on
</I>&gt;<i> their proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Quorum:*
</I>&gt;<i> The quorum necessary for the passage of a proposal is comprised of all
</I>&gt;<i> members (of the Organization) who are active in the discussion and voting
</I>&gt;<i> process after one week following notification of the proposal. Quorums can
</I>&gt;<i> be established in less than one week if all members of the Organization
</I>&gt;<i> agree to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Notification:*
</I>&gt;<i> Notification of a proposal must be given to all members (of the
</I>&gt;<i> Organization) immediately following introduction of the proposal. This
</I>&gt;<i> notification must be easily verifiable and recorded in an online database
</I>&gt;<i> that is readily accessible to all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Proxy:*
</I>&gt;<i> If a member is unable to participate in the discussion and voting of any
</I>&gt;<i> given proposal, or will be out of reach for any (reasonable) period of
</I>&gt;<i> time, and would like to be represented during their absence, they may
</I>&gt;<i> select any other member to be their proxy. The member selecting a proxy
</I>&gt;<i> must notify the Organization of their choice for proxy, as well as the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, or period of time, for which they will be absent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any member may be a proxy for any other member, or group of members.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Discussion:*
</I>&gt;<i> Discussion of a proposal may begin immediately following notification.
</I>&gt;<i> Once a quorum has been established, the discussion will remain open until
</I>&gt;<i> there are no unresolved objections.  If and when this occurs, any member of
</I>&gt;<i> the quorum may call for a vote of consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Consensus:*
</I>&gt;<i> A proposal will pass with consensus when all members of the quorum either:
</I>&gt;<i> support the proposal (thumbs up)
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> abstain from non-support (thumbs to the side).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Exigency Voting:*
</I>&gt;<i> If a majority of an established quorum decides the proposal is both urgent
</I>&gt;<i> and crucial, they may pass a proposal with an exigency vote.
</I>&gt;<i> Any member may make a claim for an exigency vote following the
</I>&gt;<i> establishment of a quorum for that specific proposal. If a majority of the
</I>&gt;<i> established quorum agrees with the exigency claim, the quorum may then vote
</I>&gt;<i> on the proposal. The proposal will move forward if a majority of the quorum
</I>&gt;<i> agrees to:
</I>&gt;<i> support the proposal (thumbs up)
</I>&gt;<i> and/or
</I>&gt;<i> abstain from non-support (thumbs to the side).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Majority:*
</I>&gt;<i> A majority of the quorum is defined as follows.....
</I>&gt;<i> 2 out of 2 members
</I>&gt;<i> 2 out of 3 members    .66
</I>&gt;<i> 3 out of 4 members    .75
</I>&gt;<i> 4 out of 5 members    .80
</I>&gt;<i> 4 out of 6 members    .66
</I>&gt;<i> 5 out of 7 members    .71
</I>&gt;<i> 6 out of 8 members    .75
</I>&gt;<i> 6 out of 9 members    .66
</I>&gt;<i> 7 out of 10 members  .70
</I>&gt;<i> 8 out of 11 members  .73
</I>&gt;<i> 8 out of 12 members  .66
</I>&gt;<i> and so on....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Blocking:*
</I>&gt;<i> An exigency claim will not move forward by a majority vote if at least (n)
</I>&gt;<i> member(s) of the quorum feel compelled to block it's passage.
</I>&gt;<i> n = (1) member for a quorum of &lt; or = 10 members.
</I>&gt;<i> n = (2) members for a quorum of quorum 11 to 20 members.
</I>&gt;<i> n = (3) members for a quorum of quorum 21 to 30 members.
</I>&gt;<i> and so on...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blocking a proposal is a very serious action and should only be used when
</I>&gt;<i> ones feels their participation in the Organization would be ethically
</I>&gt;<i> compromised should the proposal be accepted through a binding vote.  Any
</I>&gt;<i> member(s) blocking a proposal must present a reasonable and detailed
</I>&gt;<i> account of their rationale for this obstruction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Database:*
</I>&gt;<i> All proposals, together with their notifications, ensuing discussions, and
</I>&gt;<i> resulting decisions are to be recorded in an online database that is
</I>&gt;<i> readily accessible to all current members of the Organization.
