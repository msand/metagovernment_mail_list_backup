My apologies: LPA is Late Pleistocene Appropriate, which is those
remaining (very few) cultures that live much like our ancestors in the
Era of Evolutionary Adaptation lived, which is the time from 250,000
to about 50,000 years ago when human cultures and language and social
customs evolved (although some of the substrate behavior, probably
including language, evolved somewhat earlier than that).  The last
50,000 years is not sufficient time for evolution to have &quot;tuned&quot; us
much, so we're basically living with minds and bodies that were
adapted to live in bands of 20-30 individuals in an environment of
scarce resources. Which I believe explains a lot about why our
societies work so poorly.

A good survey of the field can be found in Christopher Boehm's &quot;Moral
Origins: The Evolution of Virtue, Altruism, and Shame&quot; which I cite
several times in my book.  This research is the basis of my claim that
direct democracy is actually the natural and instinctive political
organization for human beings.

If you're talking about whether you have Internet access and could
participate in a e-vote, the odds are probably 50-50 at this point,
not via computer, but via cell phone.  In 20 years the only people
without this access will be those LPA tribes ;-)

&gt;<i> It seems to me a lot of us on this forum are cephu and I am looking in a
</I>&gt;<i> mirror as I say that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, what community gives you tasty food and what do you do for
</I>&gt;<i> the community in return?
</I>
Don't know about you, but I live in a capitalist economy, which mostly
spares me the trouble of worrying about those things.  I'm inclined to
not toss that out and live like the anarcho-primitivists propose (a
philosophy that, BTW, is actually less in tune with the EEA than
democratic capitalism because it generally excludes even direct
democracy). Instead I'm inclined to tweak both our economic and
political systems to make them work better with our LPA/EEA brains.
  Regards,
    Scott
