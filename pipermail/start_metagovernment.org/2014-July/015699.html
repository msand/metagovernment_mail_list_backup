<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Thanks for answering so thoughtfully, Scott.  It's good if we continue
to talk uncommittedly in this thread, rather than get stuck in a deep
critique of any particular overplan.  I challenged you to that, but it
was only to make a point (counterpoint) that we *are* in a position to
write these overplans, or at least the initial drafts.

&gt;<i> I can't even make it past the first paragraph. ...
</I><A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/c/NxRO">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/c/NxRO</A>

But that's only an introductory paragraph.  It's there to orient the
reader to the steps of the overplan, which are its real substance.  I
think an overplan is viable if all its steps are viable.

&gt;<i> ... The axioms seem well-enough stated, but I see no evidence
</I>&gt;<i> presented that either of the two proposed systems are uniquely
</I>&gt;<i> effective methods of achieving the stated goals. ...
</I>
Each step must be viable, but uniqueness isn't a consideration.
Alternative overplans are expected.

&gt;<i> ... Being a psychologist I find the second particularly problematic:
</I>&gt;<i> There are a *lot* more effective ways to do social engineering than
</I>&gt;<i> via myth building (reinforcement-based conditioning being the most
</I>&gt;<i> obvious of these).
</I>
Okay.  If either of the myth-based steps (RaM, BaM) was unlikely to
work, then the overplan would be invalid.  Or if the overplan could be
improved by substituting steps based on psychological conditioning,
then that too would be a good critique to offer; basically you'd be
offering an alternative overplan.

&gt;<i> &gt; That's your second claim, that we can design good systems with no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea of how they could become useful to anyone.  But are you being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sincere here?  Are you really *unable* to conceive of any possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sequence of events by which a new design for a decision system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might prove useful in structuring a good government?  Or in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; furthering some other good cause?  None whatsoever?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's the problem: I can probably think of a dozen paths, and have
</I>&gt;<i> insufficient skill and information to choose among them. ...
</I>
Any path that looks feasible is okay.  The important thing is to find
at least one.  If we can't find *any* possible path, then the goal is
much more likely to be infeasible, or worse:

&gt;<i> ... Furthermore I am quite sure that no one else can do this either
</I>&gt;<i> other than the inevitable Hitler/Stalin/Mao types who don't have to
</I>&gt;<i> live within the constraints I would impose on the process (i.e., we
</I>&gt;<i> have to implement the new system without killing millions of
</I>&gt;<i> people).
</I>
But we both doubt there's any worthwhile goal to be achieved by that
step.  So if mass murder *does* appear to be necessary (we can see no
other way), then we definitely want to know about that in advance.  In
any case, I think it's always a good idea to talk about the possible
steps from the outset, e.g. whenever discussing or promoting the goal.

&gt;<i> Again, I've no problem with setting Goals.  In fact there's a
</I>&gt;<i> section in my book on this, including some things a lot more
</I>&gt;<i> specific than &quot;good government&quot; that for some inexplicable reason we
</I>&gt;<i> allow current governments to simply skate on.  But what you're
</I>&gt;<i> proposing I believe requires a level of understanding that no one
</I>&gt;<i> has.  This itself may be amenable to research, but we're decades or
</I>&gt;<i> maybe centuries away from the day when social engineering is as
</I>&gt;<i> mature a field as, e.g., structural engineering. ...
</I>
We'll never learn till we try.  You yourself have the same idea:

&gt;<i> ... Until we get a lot closer to that point, you might as well be
</I>&gt;<i> proposing we build a bridge across the East River with popsicle
</I>&gt;<i> sticks for all we know.  My approach is different: We start building
</I>&gt;<i> bridges over ditches and smaller streams, learn what works (and what
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't) with the eventual goal of taking on these bigger projects
</I>&gt;<i> using what we've learned rather than starting off making the
</I>&gt;<i> unfounded assumption that we have any idea what we're doing.
</I>
That doesn't really conflict with having big plans.  I'm reminded of
the entrepreneurs mantra, &quot;Plan big, execute small.&quot;  Both are needed
together.  Small execution alone won't work; people will become bored
(why are we doing this?), or mistrustful of the ultimate intentions
(who's cashing in?).

Likewise big planning alone won't work.  The plans must be executable
by the available people (few initially) with success measured in real
gains at every step.  It's in those small steps of execution (not just
the big planning) that we learn.  For instance, imagine what it'll
mean doing step 1 here: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/a/SoP">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/a/SoP</A>

   (CoP) Compare the overplans

I think it'll mean:

   * Small-scale governance of a collaborative catalogue of overplans
   * Being on top of the field, leading the way to the future

We know there's no reasonable way to move forward in digital democracy
(or whatever we call it) without first doing CoP.  That's step 1.  We
also know that nobody has yet done step 1, or even tried to do it.  So
we'll be the first.  It's a very *small* thing to attempt, but also
very big, because we'll be leading the way for everyone else.

We've already started, of course, and I think we'll keep going.
There's no way for anyone to block this kind of thing.  Even if turns
out to be hugely unpopular at first (as we all expect), then it'll
still be a roaring success.  It's always a roaring success when we
find the only possible pass through the mountains.

Mike
