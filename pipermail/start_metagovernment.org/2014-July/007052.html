<PRE>I've started a new vote on Loomio for my proposed new Home page.  The
previously approved decision rule (simple majority with a minimum of
1/3 of registered voters voting yes) will be used and any &quot;block&quot;
votes will simply be counted as no.  Comments and &quot;forks&quot; of the
proposal are welcome and I'll update the proposal and restart the
voting if I find any of them compelling. Closing date is Wednesday,
July 23rd, which is one week from today.

No votes on this list will count as anyone who's serious about the MG
project should have a Loomio account anyway and there is no way to
integrate the systems.  But if you want to view the proposed text
without or before voting, I've temporarily put it as my &quot;user&quot; page on
the MG site:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Metamerman">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Metamerman</A>

In the process of developing this page I think I've also come up with
a possible compromise on the issue of &quot;collaboration&quot;, which I don't
have any problem with in principle.  My problem with it is in
practice, as was demonstrated by our Vilfredo run: I just don't see
how any of the existing systems that promise that will work to run an
actual government, and I don't have any faith that people working on
them really grok authoritarian and other irrational behavior or have
specifically dealt with it in their designs.

Nevertheless, I'm certainly open to the possibility that deeply
collaborative systems will be implementable in the future.  So the
compromise would be that we publicly acknowledge that we have a two
phase philosophy, the first phase being adoption of a simple direct
democracy along the lines of my proposal or Loomio, and the second
phase being a more fully integrated collaborative system.  This
approach is necessary for two reasons:

1) The science and technology for deep collaboration simply isn't
developed enough yet, whereas that for simpler direct democracy is
already in our hands.

2) It's too big of a leap: The People are just not ready to put their
lives in the hands of something like Blinap (and Ned and I have
already had this conversation), promising though the concepts behind
it might be.  But once they're working in a functioning
direct-democracy system, they might be willing to take that next step.

If you can get behind this two-phase proposal, please vote to approve
my Home Page and we'll work on updating the pages on the web site that
address collaborative development and consensus-building to reflect
this compromise.
  Regards,
    Scott
