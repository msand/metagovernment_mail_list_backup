<PRE>(Alas, I am in a time-crunch that is going to last for several more 
weeks. There are lots of juicy tidbits to discuss at this point, but I 
am going to have to defer addressing them until my time-crunch has 
passed. So, I will make a few too-short comments now, and then try to 
repair any damage that they cause when I have more time.)

Vilfredo is a computer game (like Valve's /Half-Life/). To say that 
people stopped participating because they became &quot;dog-tired&quot; is lazy 
research and analysis. A key part of Valve's design process involves 
intentionally studying individual people who are actually playing the 
game. Rather than make superficial over-generalized guesses, we need to 
be actually, empirically study when and why individual people 
participate in the Vilfredo process. (I know that Pietro does this. 
Various others are content to simply believe their own unexamined, 
untested opinions.)

Since I don't have time right now to fully participate, I will have to 
just watch in horror any attempt to short-circuit and go around the 
Vilfredo process. But it will be OK, the world will (probably) not end 
due to that short-circuiting, and we can always blank the Home Page 
again later. (Remind me why we think that the world will end if the Home 
Page remains blanked a while longer?)

If you are going to go around Vilfredo anyway, then there is no need or 
point to having one &quot;last&quot; Vilfredo round before going around Vilfredo. 
Just put together a ballot of proposal candidates (selecting from any 
generation, or from anywhere), and then propose that as the ballot of 
candidates to be voted on. (Whoever puts together the ballot gets to 
choose what goes on it -- &quot;It's good to be king ...&quot;)

I would suggest including this item on the ballot:

    &quot;I object to making this decision in this manner. Let us first vote
    on a ballot of 'How to Decide&quot; candidates. Once we have decided how
    to decide, then we decide. (We might use the RULE PAGE RULE in
    deciding how to decide, since some seem to suppose that the /Status
    Quo/ is special ...)&quot;


------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pietro&gt; Ned, you maybe could write your idea of the Arena?

Ned&gt; The entire series of &quot;too many words&quot; proposals (2697, 2710=2734, 
2741=2754, 2765) that I have written have been each and all 
presentations of the idea that Metagovernment is a disputation arena. 
Most of those proposals made it into the Pareto Front of their 
generation, but none have been rewritten by anyone other than myself.

How participation (rewriting of Pareto Front proposals) might be 
increased is an _*EMPIRICAL*_ &quot;how to make the game better&quot; question. 
(One mprovement might be to enable the process to &quot;turn on a dime&quot; to 
better follow where the interests of the participants lead. Another 
improvement might be to enable creating integrated, interactive 
sub-processes, to allow tackling big questions through spinning out sets 
of smaller questions, on the fly.)

</I>&gt;<i> I also think the 2712 is a good candidate, but it is incorrect to

</I>&gt;<i> If you think 2712 should be on the table, then propose it.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my suggestion is this:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then we vote on ALL the proposals in the Pareto Front.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Michael, in this vote the &quot;none of the above&quot; would not be there, also 
</I>&gt;<i> because it is not clear what should be done in that case. If you have 
</I>&gt;<i> a specific idea (
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;we remain with the empty homepage&quot;, or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Vilfredo failed, we use Votorola&quot;, or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Vilfredo Failed we continue the discussion on the list&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ), just suggest specifically what we should do. Remember you can write 
</I>&gt;<i> as many proposals as you want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The voting is done among all the proposals in the Pareto Front, using 
</I>&gt;<i> Majority Judgment.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_Judgment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_Judgment</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Which is a REALLY good system.
</I>&gt;<i> (I can write a long post about why we should use that very often)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of asking who supports this, let me ask,
</I>&gt;<i> has anyone strong objections against this? Is anyone putting a veto?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Ned, I know you would rather wait, but Ed is simply too busy,
</I>&gt;<i> and I somehow would rather not see the homepage empty too long)
