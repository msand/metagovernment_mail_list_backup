<PRE>Hi Mike,

You said:
&gt;<i> It's interesting that qKonsens would allow that kind of customization.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually when a process is formalized into steps, they're hard coded.
</I>
Right. But that way qK aligns to whatever process you have and whatever 
steps you need.

&gt;<i> From what I understand, qKonsens &quot;stations&quot; and Metagov &quot;overplans&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> are different.  I think stations have these characteristics:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    * The station is a group choice
</I>&gt;<i>    * Its steps are executed by the group
</I>
Not necessarily. Also a single person could define stations and execute it 
as steps of a process (e.g. the steps to execute the overplan). But IMHO 
that would not make much sense in a cooperative environment.

&gt;<i>    * The scope of action may be large or small
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>    * The purpose of any two stations may differ; stations are used to
</I>&gt;<i>      further any kind of action
</I>
Not sure if I understand what you are saying here. Stations are more like 
different states of a process. Therefore the station represents the current 
state of a process and its current results. After the transition from one 
state to another, the next state could use the results from other stations 
without the need of discussing them again. It's a kind of separation of 
concerns.

&gt;<i> Metagov overplans differ as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>    * The overplan is an individual choice
</I>&gt;<i>    * Its steps are executed by the individual
</I>&gt;<i>    * The scope of action is always very large
</I>&gt;<i>    * The purpose of any two overplans is the same: to move the entire
</I>&gt;<i>      field of participatory democracy forward, or more generally to
</I>&gt;<i>      move the whole of humanity forward
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In your work with AG Meinungsfindungstool and the German Pirates, for
</I>&gt;<i> instance, you hope to achieve an outcome that's helpful to humanity.
</I>&gt;<i> If you were to name that outcome and list the steps to it, then that
</I>&gt;<i> would be an overplan.
</I>
Okay. I focused more on this CoP, SoP, ToP, XoP flow of actions in your 
description (<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/c/NxRO">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/c/NxRO</A>). I thought this 
are the steps to be represented with the qK Station concept. So with qK (in 
its final version) we - as metagovernment - could define those stations 
necessary to compare overplans and then everyone is invited to create her 
own overplan within qK. Of course for each overplan the author (or group) 
could define stations that might represent the steps necessary to execute 
the overplan itself. Those station could then be discussed within a 
discourse of its own.

&gt;<i> The definition was unclear before, so I re-wrote the wiki page to make
</I>&gt;<i> it clearer.  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan</A>
</I>
Not sure if I got it now?

Cheers
Marc
