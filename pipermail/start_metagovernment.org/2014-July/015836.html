&gt;<i> 1. Regarding &quot;some&quot; proposals, like the stuff that you can usually read on

</I>
Right, they are background information.  Which as I pointed out before
shouldn't even be in the documents at all: People have different
reasons for supporting things and we don't have to agree on these
reasons, we just have to agree on the final law/policy/decision.

&gt;<i> 2. Some &quot;not so important&quot; or more &quot;cutting edge issues&quot; are more &quot;islandish
</I>
You've got it backwards: The actual policies *are* the important part,
not the justifications.

&gt;<i> Of course:
</I>&gt;<i> If the method i am proposing would be used by governments TOMORROW, this
</I>&gt;<i> would end up in chaos.
</I>
TOMORROW, or the day after.

&gt;<i> BUT: It will not be used by the general public soon, so it is a useful
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism to build consensus while not being &quot;important&quot; yet.
</I>
But we have a decision to make, NOW, and it is important. So why are
you proposing a system that can't be used to help make that decision,
and worse, obstructing progress that could be made using systems that
can?

&gt;<i> The time, that this proposed method will transition into mainstream is the
</I>&gt;<i> time, when the proposed mechanism has build enough consensus on enough
</I>&gt;<i> proposals
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It can be used in smaller communities right now and those small communities
</I>&gt;<i> can grow into larger following this method.
</I>
As with &quot;consensus&quot; in general it can sometimes be used in highly
homogeneous organizations (religious groups, and apparently food coops
;-) But proposing things that only work in those environments is a
waste of everyone's time because you're trying to solve a problem that
simply doesn't exist!  They already *have* a system that works.

&gt;&gt;<i> But your &quot;islands&quot; unfortunately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are theoretical whereas streets and taxation districts and human
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beings are physical.  Until you can explain how dogs will obey your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theoretical island boundaries, I submit that your proposal is simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unworkable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There will be lots of problems how to scope which kind of issue/proposal and
</I>&gt;<i> it has to be discussed by those involved.
</I>&gt;<i> Thats why the method i am proposing gives the freedom it needs and this &quot;new
</I>&gt;<i> system&quot; doesnt have to be effective over night, but
</I>&gt;<i> it allows us to get started. Otherwise we are stuck.
</I>
We're only stuck because some members of this group are insisting on
following a philosophy that has been proven to be unworkable, at least
with our current technology, and yet simultaneously rejecting tools
(like Loomio) that can work.  It's a classic case of making the good
be the enemy of the great.  We've been working on this MG home page
issue for coming up on 2 months now, and I see no sign that any real
progress has been made.  This is no way to run an organization, and
it's particularly embarrassing when organization is supposed to be
focused developing tools that help run organizations.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If we follow the above mentioned process, we should do two things:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 1. come up with multiple decisions, each of which has 100% consensus,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; means, &quot;worst case&quot; we come up with as many decisions as we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; partcipants
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in this discussion + we need then equally many &quot;metagovernment front
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; pages&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and maybe the frontpage should be nothing more than a LIST of those many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; FRONT PAGES.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Um, I'm thinking this is another example of &quot;unworkable&quot;...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why? Even after reading my above given explanations?
</I>
Because that is not &quot;a decision&quot;, it's a proposal to institutionalize
anarchy and prevent a decision from ever being made.  That's not
&quot;working&quot;, it's just a different failure mode.

&gt;<i> Do we have to create a &quot;single home page&quot; ???
</I>
Yes.  I'd be willing to entertain the alternative if you can come up
with some examples of other public-interest web sites that do this,
but I don't know of any, nor do I consider it likely to be successful.
The most amazing thing about this whole situation is the incredible
irony of it all: The very people who are all about &quot;collaboration&quot; and
&quot;consensus&quot; are the same ones who are refusing to even acknowledge
that consensus is not possible in this situation, which in turn
clearly shows that their core philosophy is invalid!

    Scott
