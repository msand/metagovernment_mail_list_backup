<PRE>Hi Scott,

After my time-crunch is past, you and I are going to have a lot to talk 
about. But (alas), until then, I will generally pass on responding to 
shots such as these, on account of my responding would inevitably lead 
to long exchanges, and I don't have the time for that now. So, 
rain-check ...

</I>&gt;<i> through the trouble spot.  My feeling with Vilfredo, at least for
</I>&gt;<i> open-ended decisions like this Home Page, is that the morass just
</I>&gt;<i> grows and grows.  I'm not tired, I just refuse to waste any more time
</I>&gt;<i> on a process that clearly is not working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A key part of Valve's design process involves intentionally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> studying individual people who are actually playing the game. Rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make superficial over-generalized guesses, we need to be actually,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> empirically study when and why individual people participate in the Vilfredo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process. (I know that Pietro does this. Various others are content to simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe their own unexamined, untested opinions.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> This experience has not been a complete waste of time, as I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro and all of us have learned a lot about this type of system.
</I>&gt;<i> But what I mostly learned is that the domain should be very restricted
</I>&gt;<i> for Vilfredo to be a useful tool.  Perhaps we could try it again with
</I>&gt;<i> the decision-rule question ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since I don't have time right now to fully participate, I will have to just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watch in horror any attempt to short-circuit and go around the Vilfredo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process. But it will be OK, the world will (probably) not end due to that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> short-circuiting, and we can always blank the Home Page again later. (Remind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me why we think that the world will end if the Home Page remains blanked a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while longer?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> It's coming up on two months now, and IMHO we have lost a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> credibility as an &quot;organization&quot; because if we can't even govern
</I>&gt;<i> ourselves, what hope do we have of being instrumental in the
</I>&gt;<i> production of a system that would allow others to do so?  You all seem
</I>&gt;<i> to be perfectly comfortable allowing decisions to take months, as long
</I>&gt;<i> as they're the &quot;right&quot; decisions, and that no decision is better than
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;wrong&quot; decision.  But I submit that you are living in a fantasy
</I>&gt;<i> world because the real world doesn't work this way.  As I said in my
</I>&gt;<i> first post to this list, it's time to put up or shut up: 6 years
</I>&gt;<i> without a viable decision-making system (or even a debate/vote on a
</I>&gt;<i> decision rule) is long enough to conclusively determine that whatever
</I>&gt;<i> you're doing isn't working.  You're occupying valuable real estate and
</I>&gt;<i> mind share and it's time to either make use of it, or admit that your
</I>&gt;<i> approach had serious flaws and then change it.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
