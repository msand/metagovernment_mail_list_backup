</I>&gt;<i> Exactly!

Not exactly: There must be some common beliefs or we wouldn't have all
gravitated here.  What we need to do is identify these common beliefs
and put them on the home page ;-)

&gt;<i> The way I see it, we&#8217;re a disparate group of individuals, each with our individual visions of how to successfully manage the decision making of an enormously (if not infinitely) complex system. Perhaps it&#8217;s a bit idealistic to imagine that any single vision (system or method) will ever sufficiently address the massive diversity of demand encompassed by the whole. Any comprehensive solution to the question &quot;How can we best govern ourselves?&#8221; will very likely include *most of the above*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, we don't have to agree on the details, just on the basic
principles.  I've seen this issue brought up several places on the MG
site yet no one has actually taken the trouble to even do a poll to
enable ranking of these principles by the number of people who support
them.  Perhaps this is something that we could actually use OpaVote
for: Generate a list of facts/principles, then have everyone rank
them.  Sort of an abuse of that system, but it could prove to be a way
to finally solve this problem.  Another thing it would do: Since
OpaVote works differently from the other systems (i.e., you don't
create an account) it would seem to me that we could turn over the
entire list of email addresses to OpaVote and see if some of the
lurkers would participate in that vote who don't participate here or
on the other voting systems.

I've posted my list of principles several times, but here's an even
more abbreviated version:
1) Representative government is inherently corrupt
2) Direct democracy is our natural and instinctive preference
3) Direct democracy works, but only with technological assistance for
large groups
4) Dynamic delegation is a required component of the system
5) Authoritarian behavior needs to be constrained by the system
6) Radical transparency (including open voting) is necessary to
prevent corruption
7) Radical transparency (including open voting) is required to
constrain authoritarians

Things that I see to be secondary, not important, or impossible that I
know some people came here for that I therefore think should also be
on the list:
8) Consensus in an important goal
9) Deep collaboration among all the electorate is an important goal
10) &quot;mob rule&quot; and &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; are significant problems
in democratic systems
11) Flapping/cycling is a serious problem in democratic systems
12) Vote secrecy is necessary
13) Different voting systems can be used at different levels
14) Voting data and apps can be distributed rather than centralized
15) Interoperability among voting systems is necessary

I think we should stay away from these because they are not central to
the role of the MG site, but I think they represent core divisions in
our ranks:
16) The new government will gradually replace the existing one by
rendering it irrelevant vs. complete replacement when the new system
is ready
17) One must work within the system to improve it vs. simply replacing
it in a single vote

&gt;<i> On a similar note...I personally don&#8217;t think our coming to *agreement* is either crucial or significant for what is actually developing within our group. In my mind, this list is a crucible. We discuss, challenge, argue, and debate in order to continually refine our individual visions with the feedback that comes from the unending brawl of 'justifiable' opinion. I think it&#8217;s futile to imagine that we will ever agree on anything substantial.  Or that we will ever really need to.   Maybe someday&#8230;..it&#8217;s a nice thought anyway.  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Until then, let&#8217;s put the *fun* back in &#8216;dysfunctional' and continue on with the &#8220;I&#8217;m right vs. No, I&#8217;m right&#8221; method.   I think it has potential&#8230;.as long as we don&#8217;t take ourselves (and our strategies to save democracy) too seriously.
</I>&gt;<i> _______________________________________________

Agreed: the list is working fine for me.  Our problem is just with the
MG home page decision.
  Regards,
    Scott
