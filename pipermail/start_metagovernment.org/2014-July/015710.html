<PRE>Hi Mike,

You said:
&gt;<i> In this thread, we're discussing overplans (step-wise ways forward)
</I>&gt;<i> and the idea of comparing them.  So basically this thread is about:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   (1) Overplans and comparative overplanning
</I>
That was just a side note, because I saw history repeating in your 
discussion.
My intention was not to hijack the thread.

&gt;<i> Mark, you bring up two additional topics:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   (2) qKonsens, a new tool your team is developing
</I>
The qK is better referred to as a methodology rather than an implementation 
of a concrete tool.

&gt;<i>   (3) How qKonsens might be used in overplanning
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could we discuss those in separate threads?  We should probably wait
</I>&gt;<i> till someone has a clear understanding of both (1) and (2) before we
</I>&gt;<i> open thread (3), in which we discuss the combination.
</I>
Sure.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In your work with AG Meinungsfindungstool and the German Pirates,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for instance, you hope to achieve an outcome that's helpful to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; humanity.  If you were to name that outcome and list the steps to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it, then that would be an overplan.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Okay...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So now I guess you roughly understand what overplans are.
</I>
Hope so ;o)

&gt;&gt;<i> ... So with qK (in its final version) we - as metagovernment - could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> define those stations necessary to compare overplans and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone is invited to create her own overplan within qK. ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Technically we might do that.  I assume qKonsens can host a catalogue
</I>&gt;<i> of texts, because overplans are texts.
</I>
Not qK is hosting this, but the d!sco network is. The d!sco network is a P2P 
network based on the Discussion Ontology.

&gt;<i> But politically I think it would fail.
</I>&gt;<i> We'd never get competitors (like you and me) to work from
</I>&gt;<i> an overplan catalogue that's hosted by a rival competitor.  Even if
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov deploys its own instance of qKonsens independently of the
</I>&gt;<i> German Pirate Party and AG Meinungsfindungstool, it would still be
</I>&gt;<i> tied to those two.  It wouldn't be neutral.
</I>
That's a very old fashioned perception. I hope we are already in the 
beginning to overcome this ancient view on competition. Einstein once has 
said that problems that emerge from a specific mindset could not be solved 
by applying the same mindset again.

Hence we may need to change our habits first. Therefore let us encourage 
different platforms and tools to act more towards cooperation rather than 
competition.

&gt;<i> The Metagov wiki, however, is feasible on both technical and political
</I>&gt;<i> grounds.  Ideally qKonsens could still be used in the context of the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki by whoever chooses to use it, and I hope we can work together to
</I>&gt;<i> make that choice possible.  We've already installed a device in the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki for this purpose: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Toolset_switch">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Toolset_switch</A>
</I>
But how I understand metagovernment.org it is more towards the academical 
view of the theoratical issues - that's nothing that would help users to 
participate in online deliberation. So I see metagov as a melting pot for 
tool developers and theoreticians to discuss their ideologies.

We at the working group AG MFT would like to overcome this by practicing out 
our theories.

&gt;<i> Please let's discuss these technical topics in separate threads.  This
</I>&gt;<i> thread I hope to reserve for basic discussion of overplans, if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> still has questions, etc, about what they are.
</I>
Ideally speaking what is needed to reach the next level of online 
deliberation IMHO is to agree on the least common denominator first. This is 
what are the basic needs for a corruption-, hierarchy- and authority- free 
online deliberation.

Cheers
Marc
