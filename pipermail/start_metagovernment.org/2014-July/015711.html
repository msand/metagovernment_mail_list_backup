<PRE>Hi Marc,

&gt;<i> That was just a side note, because I saw history repeating in your
</I>&gt;<i> discussion.  My intention was not to hijack the thread.
</I>
No, I didn't think so.  I was concerned only to avoid confusion.
Thanks for replying so candidly.  You raise several points that I
can't easily reply to at the moment, but also this one, which I hope
we can discuss immediately:

&gt;<i> Ideally speaking what is needed to reach the next level of online
</I>&gt;<i> deliberation IMHO is to agree on the least common denominator
</I>&gt;<i> first. This is what are the basic needs for a corruption-,
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy- and authority- free online deliberation.
</I>
You and I seem to have different views on the current state of online
deliberation.  But leaving that aside for the moment, what practical
steps do you intend on taking in order to move forward?  You claim
that agreement on basic needs is necessary, for example.  Then what
steps do you plan in order to make that agreement happen?

I'm asking you an entirely practical question, you see.

Mike
