<PRE>I suppose &quot;voting&quot; is the last exit strategy if no consensus could be reach 
by deliberation, right? If there is consensus, no voting is needed anymore. 
And consensus is reached by the &quot;no unresolved objection&quot; rule. Or we might 
differentiate here between several available consensus processes. But all 
those are using ratings instead of voting.

Hence I would like to propose to NOT VOTE at all!

@Mike: But for this proposal, as it would made the situation even worse from 
my point of view, please put me on the Against list.

Subject: [MG] (proposal 6) Reduce the majority for constitutional decisions 
from 80 to 65 percent?

I think the 80% majority required to change the decision rule is too
high and threatens the integrity of the community.  As we grow, the
difficulty of changing our own decision process will increase to the
point where it becomes next to impossible, leading eventually to the
break up of the community.  I propose that a 65% majority is enough.


   PROPOSAL 6
   ----------
   To amend the decision rule:
   <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules?oldid=3545">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules?oldid=3545</A>

   Replace all instances of &quot;80%&quot; with &quot;65%&quot;.

   Replace all instances of &quot;0.8&quot; with &quot;0.65&quot;.


   CURRENT VOTES
   -------------
       For: Mike
   Against: (nobody)


Turnout matters here, so please vote.  The threshold is higher when
fewer of us vote.  If less than 8 vote, then *all* must vote 'yes'.
