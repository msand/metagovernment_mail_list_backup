<PRE>Hi Mike,

Just a short side note on this. I am not sure if I understand the concept of
overplans correctly, but I think the qKonsens in its final version will
contain a very simillar concept. The qK methodology uses the term 'Station'
to specify  a kind of separated steps of execution within the
decision-making process. This steps can be in paralell or in sequence. But
instead of fixing the Stations, the qK delegates the definition to each
discourse. The discourse then passes the defined Stations.

There might be a default Station definition that could look like the below:

&#8226;    SITUATION (problem analysis)
&#8226;    IDEA (possible solutions)
&#8226;    CONCEPT (how to implement a concrete solution)
&#8226;    PROGRAM (in the meaning of Program-Management, Portfolio-Management)
&#8226;    PROJECT (one smaler part of the Program)
&#8226;    ACTION (executing tasks)

Disclaimer: Because I am not the master mind behind the qKonsens, I might 
not have found the best explaination here. So please be gentle ;o)

Cheers
Marc

I make a logical claim and challenge you to refute it.  Then I suggest
there's an immediate governance task here for Metagov.

   <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxR">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxR</A>

Abstract overplan NxR tells how to eliminate existential risk.  It
builds on overplan SoP with the addition of steps for existential
underplanning.  The rationale behind existential underplanning is that
we can reasonably concern ourselves with important things in the
present and future, such as the difference between right and wrong
action, and the choice of the best possible future, only if we plan on
being around in the future.  The added steps are designed to make sure
of that.

   CoP
    |
   SoP
    |
   ToP
    |
   XoP
    |
   CeP   Compare the existential plans
    |
   SeP   Select the best existential plans
    .
    .

   XeP   Execute the existential plans
    |
   NxR   Eliminate existential risk


I claim that humanity has no other way forward.  The only overplans
that can possibly make sense are those that build on NxR, ultimately
filling in its hotspot (SeP . . XeP) with concrete steps.  In other
words, any proposal for moving forward that fails to include the steps
summarized above is irrational.  (Follow the links at top for details
of the steps.)

Is this claim true?  If yes, then I suggest it illustrates how Metagov
can contribute to the future of humanity, by acting as the neutral
custodian for these overplans.  There'll be many of them and people
everywhere will use them to structure their discussions.  There's just
no other way forward.  Supporting that all-important structure is a
small (initially) governance task that we can tackle immediately with
a fair chance of success.  It's also more interesting (and arguably a
higher priority) than the home page.

That's just to say there's something immediate and concrete at stake.
So please try hard to refute my claim above (show that I'm wrong).
