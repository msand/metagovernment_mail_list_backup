</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a request for feedback.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#8217;m associated with a small group of locals who have recently purchased
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several hundred acres with the intention of developing  a *Sustainability
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Research and Education Village*. I&#8217;m inspired to help this group with their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision process or protocol. Below is a draft I&#8217;ve put together towards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that end.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would very much appreciate some friendly critique from any of you who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have the time to read it through. (I&#8217;m guessing it may take more than one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pass to fully grok it.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#8217;m calling it *the Beta Council*.  The &#8220;Organization&quot; currently consists
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of a dozen or so individuals&#8230;and hasn&#8217;t yet formed into any official
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entity. We are just getting started.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Your questions and feedback are most welcome.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TIA,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Steve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *The Organization:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This Organization (currently a non-entity) consists of those members who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are participating in it's development though the process of *the Beta
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Council*.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Membership:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To become a member of this Organization one must receive an invitation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (approved by a majority of the existing members of Organization) in order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to register with *the Beta Council*. One's membership may be revoked at any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time by a majority vote of the Organization.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> **the Beta Council*: *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *the Beta Council* is a proposal introduction and approval *protocol*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supported by an online decision-making mechanism with a database (currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being hosted on Loomio.org).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Proposals:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All proposals generated by this Organization will be initiated by a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> member (or a group of members) through *the Beta Council*.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Proposals must be clear, concise, and itemized if lengthy. They may be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revised or amended [and then re-stated by the original proposer(s)] at any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point during the discussion phase of the process. Anytime a proposal is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> substantially altered, the revised proposal must be re-initiated through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *the Beta Council* and a new quorum must then be established. The original
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposer(s) may revoke their proposal at anytime prior to a binding vote on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Quorum:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The quorum necessary for the passage of a proposal is comprised of all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> members (of the Organization) who are active in the discussion and voting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process after one week following notification of the proposal. Quorums can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be established in less than one week if all members of the Organization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agree to do so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Notification:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Notification of a proposal must be given to all members (of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Organization) immediately following introduction of the proposal. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notification must be easily verifiable and recorded in an online database
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is readily accessible to all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Proxy:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If a member is unable to participate in the discussion and voting of any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> given proposal, or will be out of reach for any (reasonable) period of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time, and would like to be represented during their absence, they may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> select any other member to be their proxy. The member selecting a proxy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> must notify the Organization of their choice for proxy, as well as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal, or period of time, for which they will be absent.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any member may be a proxy for any other member, or group of members.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Discussion:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Discussion of a proposal may begin immediately following notification.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once a quorum has been established, the discussion will remain open until
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are no unresolved objections.  If and when this occurs, any member of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the quorum may call for a vote of consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Consensus:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A proposal will pass with consensus when all members of the quorum either:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support the proposal (thumbs up)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abstain from non-support (thumbs to the side).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Exigency Voting:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If a majority of an established quorum decides the proposal is both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> urgent and crucial, they may pass a proposal with an exigency vote.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any member may make a claim for an exigency vote following the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> establishment of a quorum for that specific proposal. If a majority of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> established quorum agrees with the exigency claim, the quorum may then vote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the proposal. The proposal will move forward if a majority of the quorum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agrees to:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support the proposal (thumbs up)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and/or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abstain from non-support (thumbs to the side).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Majority:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A majority of the quorum is defined as follows.....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2 out of 2 members
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2 out of 3 members    .66
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3 out of 4 members    .75
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4 out of 5 members    .80
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4 out of 6 members    .66
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5 out of 7 members    .71
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6 out of 8 members    .75
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6 out of 9 members    .66
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7 out of 10 members  .70
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 8 out of 11 members  .73
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 8 out of 12 members  .66
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and so on....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Blocking:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An exigency claim will not move forward by a majority vote if at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (n) member(s) of the quorum feel compelled to block it's passage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> n = (1) member for a quorum of &lt; or = 10 members.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> n = (2) members for a quorum of quorum 11 to 20 members.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> n = (3) members for a quorum of quorum 21 to 30 members.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and so on...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blocking a proposal is a very serious action and should only be used when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ones feels their participation in the Organization would be ethically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compromised should the proposal be accepted through a binding vote.  Any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> member(s) blocking a proposal must present a reasonable and detailed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> account of their rationale for this obstruction.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Database:*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All proposals, together with their notifications, ensuing discussions,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and resulting decisions are to be recorded in an online database that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> readily accessible to all current members of the Organization.
