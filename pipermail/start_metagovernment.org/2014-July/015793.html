<PRE>Sorry, I didn't see any post so far, that might sanctify moderation for this 
list!
But this does not mean, that I don't use local filters on this list ;o)

Please check me in for Against.

Subject: Re: [MG] (proposal 7) Elect a moderator for the mailing list?

The red line for me was the first threat of violence I received in
this list (no names).  It's not so much that I'm physically frightened
by that kind of thing, or even just &quot;offended&quot; by it, as you put it.
I'm more worried about the effects of us tolerating it.  If we don't
aim at a minimal level of civilized behaviour, but accept whatever is
thrown at us, then we'll lose the best people, attract the worst, and
slowly sink into a shithole.  I think that's pretty much guaranteed.
