<PRE>I was able to Google on anthropology lpa and get a gloss earlier.  In that
gloss ceptu was a character and a net was a lpa tool for catching animals
via community cooperation.

I am detached enough recently to look at humans and sit back and wait to
enjoy the ensuing hilarity.   But looking into the kind of mirrors I use
there is quite a bit of hilarity there too.  So I will offer you a bit of
food.

US urban areas have about a 3 day food supply.  In case of a problem the
local emergency people are not there and it will be three days before
outside help is available.  If that is not going to arrive in a timely
fashion then your fiat money will not buy food.  And then who will feed you
and why?

Some food is rotten.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm.  It took a bit to track down the anthropological references.  Those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acronyms do not Google well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My apologies: LPA is Late Pleistocene Appropriate, which is those
</I>&gt;<i> remaining (very few) cultures that live much like our ancestors in the
</I>&gt;<i> Era of Evolutionary Adaptation lived, which is the time from 250,000
</I>&gt;<i> to about 50,000 years ago when human cultures and language and social
</I>&gt;<i> customs evolved (although some of the substrate behavior, probably
</I>&gt;<i> including language, evolved somewhat earlier than that).  The last
</I>&gt;<i> 50,000 years is not sufficient time for evolution to have &quot;tuned&quot; us
</I>&gt;<i> much, so we're basically living with minds and bodies that were
</I>&gt;<i> adapted to live in bands of 20-30 individuals in an environment of
</I>&gt;<i> scarce resources. Which I believe explains a lot about why our
</I>&gt;<i> societies work so poorly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A good survey of the field can be found in Christopher Boehm's &quot;Moral
</I>&gt;<i> Origins: The Evolution of Virtue, Altruism, and Shame&quot; which I cite
</I>&gt;<i> several times in my book.  This research is the basis of my claim that
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy is actually the natural and instinctive political
</I>&gt;<i> organization for human beings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose i play in a small rural community with nets as a tool and i am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cephu.  What do you say to me?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're talking about whether you have Internet access and could
</I>&gt;<i> participate in a e-vote, the odds are probably 50-50 at this point,
</I>&gt;<i> not via computer, but via cell phone.  In 20 years the only people
</I>&gt;<i> without this access will be those LPA tribes ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems to me a lot of us on this forum are cephu and I am looking in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mirror as I say that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alternatively, what community gives you tasty food and what do you do for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the community in return?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't know about you, but I live in a capitalist economy, which mostly
</I>&gt;<i> spares me the trouble of worrying about those things.  I'm inclined to
</I>&gt;<i> not toss that out and live like the anarcho-primitivists propose (a
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy that, BTW, is actually less in tune with the EEA than
</I>&gt;<i> democratic capitalism because it generally excludes even direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy). Instead I'm inclined to tweak both our economic and
</I>&gt;<i> political systems to make them work better with our LPA/EEA brains.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
