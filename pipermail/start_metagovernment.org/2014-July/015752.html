I agree with the issues of leadership, whether it's our existing
representative governments or a new direct democracy-based system: As
explained in my book, inherent flaws in the mindsets of those who
would take on these positions of power prevent them from making the
right decisions for the majority of the people.

HOWEVER, the MG home page I think is a good counterargument to my (and
your) position: Because there is no leadership, nothing is getting
done.  I'd be happy if someone showed some *initiative* (which I
consider to be different from leadership) and just put the top
contender up on Loomio for a plain-old up-or-down vote.  I'd do it
myself, but I'm the new guy and apparently can be ignored (e.g., my
claim that the decision rule has been changed by popular vote was not
supported over Ed's contention that a change of governing policy
requires operating under the existing rules, nevermind that IMHO Ed's
policy renders the entire MG project nothing more than a waste of time
and mindshare because nothing will ever change if you have to work
within the system to change it).
  Regards,
    Scott
