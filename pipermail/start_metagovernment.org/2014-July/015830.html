</I>
OK, that sounds not so much like &quot;gridlock&quot; as it does &quot;anarchy&quot;.
Certainly &quot;gridlock&quot; and long-term preservation of the status quo are
part of it, but you're apparently proposing an even less effective
government than that.  I can just see applying this philosophy to the
question of whether you need to leash your dog when walking on a
public street: The petless &quot;hardliners&quot; will insist that no dogs be
allowed on public streets at all and the pitbull owners will just let
their dogs run at large with no supervision whatsoever because that's
just the kind of hairpins they are.  And there's no one to stop them
because it will take 20 or 30 years to make a decision that's binding
on everyone.

&gt;&gt;<i> Again, the purpose of government is to enable collective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisionmaking.  Without decisionmaking, there is no government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Decisionmaking is meaningless without &quot;Scope&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> What is the scope of the decision? This is what i wanted to question with
</I>&gt;<i> above example...
</I>
The &quot;scope&quot; is obviously physical: You can't make a decision about
whether dogs must be leashed on *my* street unless you also live on
(or maybe have to use) that street.  But your &quot;islands&quot; unfortunately
are theoretical whereas streets and taxation districts and human
beings are physical.  Until you can explain how dogs will obey your
theoretical island boundaries, I submit that your proposal is simply
unworkable.

&gt;&gt;<i> Now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that this home page project has clearly shown that this is the case,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can we get back to the business of government by making a decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about what to put on it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we follow the above mentioned process, we should do two things:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. come up with multiple decisions, each of which has 100% consensus, which
</I>&gt;<i> means, &quot;worst case&quot; we come up with as many decisions as we are partcipants
</I>&gt;<i> in this discussion + we need then equally many &quot;metagovernment front pages&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe the frontpage should be nothing more than a LIST of those many
</I>&gt;<i> FRONT PAGES.
</I>
Um, I'm thinking this is another example of &quot;unworkable&quot;...

&gt;<i> Maybe if one &quot;FRONT PAGE&quot; has more support, it shows up further on top of
</I>&gt;<i> that list of &quot;FRONT PAGES&quot; which would give motivation to continue the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion to &quot;unite&quot; the &quot;FRONT PAGES&quot; :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...so each of us could or could not participate in the discussion and nobody
</I>&gt;<i> could block anyone else by not participating or being against a proposal...
</I>&gt;<i> what do you think?
</I>
Hey, I like visionaries and idealists as much as anyone, but at some
point &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot; and &quot;the rubber hits the road&quot;.
When you get a little closer to that point in your design by all means
bring this idea up again.  Mean time, we've got an actual *single*
home page to develop.
  Regards,
     Scott
