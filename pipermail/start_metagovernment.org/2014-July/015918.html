<PRE>Closely held always had a way to control the shares.

Fiduciary duty is largely a case law definition recently (last century or
so)

Benefit corporations override the case law.

SCOTUS as in hobby lobby is in the process of overriding the case law for
all closely held  and part of the reasoning is from benefit corporations.
Yah.  I am liberal religious and i want to scream except some of the
plaintiffs are friends but in any case i am unable to say even to myself
that SCOTUS is wrong on this.

So i think your concerns about fiduciary duty needs more context.  But
fiduciary duty needs to be on check off list.

Thanks for the analysis.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My sense is that proposal development is ideally a collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process&#8230;.kinda like we&#8217;re doing here.  (Yeah, I know you don&#8217;t like that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; word :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I actually don't have a problem with that one, it's &quot;consensus&quot; that
</I>&gt;<i> causes me to roll my eyes ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Collaboration definitely has a place during the process, especially
</I>&gt;<i> early on.  But there are lots of tools that support that and it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't need to be in the main voting/governing system since the
</I>&gt;<i> majority of the population won't be collaborating, just voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe when the group increases in size, though it&#8217;s difficult to imagine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ever turning that determination over to a &quot;special interest group&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My belief is that collaboration isn't necessary or indeed probably
</I>&gt;<i> won't even work when you get more than dozen or so actors involved
</I>&gt;<i> (though some of those actors may be other special interest groups
</I>&gt;<i> composed of multiple individuals).  And that you *have* to assume that
</I>&gt;<i> that's the way things will get started because these special interest
</I>&gt;<i> groups are where all the energy required to shape a proposal will be
</I>&gt;<i> found.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I still like my &quot;25% yes votes&quot; quorum rule.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don&#8217;t understand. How does that work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At least 25% of the registered voters have to vote yes.  This weeds
</I>&gt;<i> out proposals that a large majority just don't see the need to even
</I>&gt;<i> inform themselves on (and so couldn't cast an informed vote on), and
</I>&gt;<i> also tactics where a small minority try to get something passed by
</I>&gt;<i> deception or other tricks (the example in my book is authoritarians,
</I>&gt;<i> who make up roughly 25% of the general population yet are the source
</I>&gt;<i> of most of the prejudiced and unethical behavior, doing something like
</I>&gt;<i> holding a vote during a holiday or trying to hide something nasty in
</I>&gt;<i> an otherwise harmless-looking proposal).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Grin.  yes.  such pessimism Scott!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Though to some extent I agree. So much depends on the nature of the
</I>group
&gt;<i> &gt; (their coherence)...and their willingness to collaborate (or get beyond
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; individual ego).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I&#8217;ve experienced this and it&#8217;s quite empowering. I suspect it&#8217;s a
</I>phenomenon
&gt;<i> &gt; we are evolving into as a culture&#8230;maybe as a species. I&#8217;m holding the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; optimistic realm.  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the evolving part, but we need to help that along by
</I>&gt;<i> creating systems that *support* this evolved conception.  As for
</I>&gt;<i> whether consensus is a reasonable goal, you've got your food coop,
</I>&gt;<i> I've got a list of HOA Board failures a mile long (some of which have
</I>&gt;<i> cost me personally a lot of time and money).  HOAs IMHO being a lot
</I>&gt;<i> more representative of how the general population behaves than more
</I>&gt;<i> specialized organizations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, if your goal is to preserve that land as open space, allowing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blocks is a great way to achieve it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My thinking is that allowing &#8220;blocks&#8221;...along side the ability of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; membership to expel someone who uses them irresponsibly should limit
</I>their
&gt;<i> &gt; abuse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, this does open up a whole 'nother range of options.  I'm actually
</I>&gt;<i> a big fan of this architecture, and even included the option for
</I>&gt;<i> Localities in my book: Some authoritarians in a city/county/state want
</I>&gt;<i> to act like ass hats?  Fine, let them do it without the benefit of the
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation/funding/infrastructure of the non-ass-hat majority.  I
</I>&gt;<i> wish we in the US had this option for Mississippi ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This kind of thing is difficult to structure legally, however,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if there are financial interests involved (i.e., you have
</I>&gt;<i> to have a well structured way to buy out the offenders, since you
</I>&gt;<i> can't just deprive them of the ability to perform their fiduciary duty
</I>&gt;<i> to their investments).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
