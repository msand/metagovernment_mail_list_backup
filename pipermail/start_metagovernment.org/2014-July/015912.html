<PRE>Is the universe a toad?

Toad Words

ursulavernon:

            Frogs fall out of my mouth when I talk. Toads, too.

            It used to be a problem.

            There was an incident when I was young and cross and fed up
with parental expectations. My sister, who is the Good One, has gold fall
from her lips, and since I could not be her, I had to go a different way.

            So I got frogs. It happens.

            &#8220;You&#8217;ll grow into it,&#8221; the fairy godmother said. &#8220;Some curses
have cloth-of-gold linings.&#8221; She considered this, and her finger drifted to
her lower lip, the way it did when she was forgetting things. &#8220;Mind you,
some curses just grind you down and leave you broken. Some blessings do
that too, though. Hmm. What was I saying?&#8221;

            I spent a lot of time not talking. I got a slate and wrote
things down. It was hard at first, but I hated to drop the frogs in the
middle of the road. They got hit by cars, or dried out, miles away from
their damp little homes.

            Toads were easier. Toads are tough. After awhile, I learned to
feel when a word was a toad and not a frog. I could roll the word around on
my tongue and get the flavor before I spoke it. Toad words were
drier. Desiccated is a toad word. So iscrisp and crisis and obligation. So
are elegant and matchstick.

            Frog words were a bit more varied. Murky. Purple. Swinging.
Jazz.

I practiced in the field behind the house, speaking words over and over,
sending small creatures hopping into the evening.  I learned to speak some
words as either toads or frogs. It&#8217;s all in the delivery.

            Love is a frog word, if spoken earnestly, and a toad word if
spoken sarcastically. Frogs are not good at sarcasm.

            Toads are masters of it.

            I learned one day that the amphibians are going extinct all
over the world, that some of them are vanishing. You go to ponds that
should be full of frogs and find them silent. There are a hundred things
responsible&#8212;fungus and pesticides and acid rain.

            When I heard this, I cried &#8220;What!?&#8221; so loudly that an adult
African bullfrog fell from my lips and I had to catch it. It weighed as
much as a small cat. I took it to the pet store and spun them a lie in
writing about my cousin going off to college and leaving the frog behind.

            I brooded about frogs for weeks after that, and then
eventually, I decided to do something about it.

            I cannot fix the things that kill them. It would take an army
of fairy godmothers, and mine retired long ago. Now she goes on long
cruises and spreads her wings out across the deck chairs.

            But I can make more.

            I had to get a field guide at first. It was a long process. Say
a word and catch it, check the field marks. Most words turn to bronze frogs
if I am not paying attention.

            Poison arrow frogs make my lips go numb. I can only do a few of
those a day. I go through a lot of chapstick.

            It is a holding action I am fighting, nothing more. I go to
vernal pools and whisper sonnets that turn into wood frogs. I say the words
squeak and squill and spring peepers skitter away into the trees. They
begin singing almost the moment they emerge.

            I read long legal documents to a growing audience of Fowler&#8217;s
toads, who blink their goggling eyes up at me. (I wish I could do
salamanders. I would read Clive Barker novels aloud and seed the streams
with efts and hellbenders. I would fly to Mexico and read love poems in
another language to restore the axolotl. Alas, it&#8217;s frogs and toads and
nothing more. We make do.)

            The woods behind my house are full of singing. The neighbors
either learn to love it or move away.

            My sister&#8212;the one who speaks gold and diamonds&#8212;funds my
travels. She speaks less than I do, but for me and my amphibian friends,
she will vomit rubies and sapphires. I am grateful.

            I am practicing reading modernist revolutionary poetry aloud.
My accent is atrocious. Still, a day will come when the Panamanian golden
frog will tumble from my lips, and I will catch it and hold it, and
whatever word I spoke, I&#8217;ll say again and again, until I stand at the
center of a sea of yellow skins, and make from my curse at last a cloth of
gold.

Terri Windling posted recently about the old fairy tale of frogs falling
from a girl&#8217;s lips, and I started thinking about what I&#8217;d do if that
happened to me, and&#8230;well&#8230;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I suppose you could. The only alternative I see to would be to go
</I>&gt;<i> with an unmodified consensus model.
</I>&gt;<i> In a small group I&#8217;m not sure how one would *split the difference* between
</I>&gt;<i> the two.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd recommend leaving any mention of specific technology out of this
</I>&gt;<i> document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, I&#8217;m just in the initial draft phase of things.
</I>&gt;<i> I put in the Loomio reference as suggestive of where we will likely begin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still thinking two-phase for this process: The proposal gets rated
</I>&gt;<i> and approved by a special interest group during which the proposer can
</I>&gt;<i> change it at any time (sparing making the determination of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;substantially altered&quot; and consequent squabbling about whether a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal is valid or not, and the issue of quorum).  Once that group
</I>&gt;<i> somehow decides it's ready (and I would leave that to the group and
</I>&gt;<i> primarily the original proposer), they submit it to a vote of the full
</I>&gt;<i> membership during which it can't be altered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My sense is that proposal development is ideally a collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> process&#8230;.kinda like we&#8217;re doing here.  (Yeah, I know you don&#8217;t like that
</I>&gt;<i> word :)
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe when the group increases in size, though it&#8217;s difficult to imagine
</I>&gt;<i> ever turning that determination over to a &quot;special interest group&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still like my &quot;25% yes votes&quot; quorum rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t understand. How does *that *work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With your proposed policy, I predict people trying to game the system by
</I>&gt;<i> holding a vote
</I>&gt;<i> between Christmas and New Year's or during a power outage (or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever), and passing something with a tiny fraction of the
</I>&gt;<i> membership.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm. I suppose any system can be gamed, one way or the other. Trying to
</I>&gt;<i> find the middle ground.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notification:
</I>&gt;<i> Notification of a proposal must be given to all members (of the
</I>&gt;<i> Organization) immediately following introduction of the proposal. This
</I>&gt;<i> notification must be easily verifiable and recorded in an online database
</I>&gt;<i> that is readily accessible to all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This one's tough.  Would simply sending an email be sufficient?  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> inclined to use time in my system.  Maybe have all votes close on the
</I>&gt;<i> 1st of the month.  Send an email to remind people, but if that email
</I>&gt;<i> gets spam filtered or whatever you still have a binding vote because
</I>&gt;<i> they should *know* to log in and check if something is running (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> thinking Sunday evening closing, but then I'm anticipating a much
</I>&gt;<i> busier government system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A quorum isn&#8217;t possible until after one week following notification.
</I>&gt;<i> (unless the entire membership agrees.)
</I>&gt;<i> And most notifications will be automatic using Loomio.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proxy:
</I>&gt;<i> If a member is unable to participate in the discussion and voting of any
</I>&gt;<i> given proposal, or will be out of reach for any (reasonable) period of
</I>&gt;<i> time,
</I>&gt;<i> and would like to be represented during their absence, they may select any
</I>&gt;<i> other member to be their proxy. The member selecting a proxy must notify
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> Organization of their choice for proxy, as well as the proposal, or period
</I>&gt;<i> of time, for which they will be absent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good, although Loomio doesn't support this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not yet. One of Loomio&#8217;s best features (IMO) is their openness to adding
</I>&gt;<i> features requested by their users.
</I>&gt;<i> They are about to add *modifiable* buttons.  I&#8217;m thinking one could
</I>&gt;<i> possibly be used to track the *quorum* and maybe *proxies* as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Discussion:
</I>&gt;<i> Discussion of a proposal may begin immediately following notification. Once
</I>&gt;<i> a quorum has been established, the discussion will remain open until there
</I>&gt;<i> are no unresolved objections.  If and when this occurs, any member of the
</I>&gt;<i> quorum may call for a vote of consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You know my position on this one: If your (or really anyone's) purpose
</I>&gt;<i> is to preserve the target property as undeveloped open space, this is
</I>&gt;<i> the way to achieve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Grin.  yes.  such pessimism Scott!
</I>&gt;<i> Though to some extent I agree. So much depends on the nature of the group
</I>&gt;<i> (their coherence)...and their willingness to collaborate (or get beyond the
</I>&gt;<i> individual ego).
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve experienced this and it&#8217;s quite empowering. I suspect it&#8217;s a
</I>&gt;<i> phenomenon we are evolving into as a culture&#8230;maybe as a species. I&#8217;m
</I>&gt;<i> holding the optimistic realm.  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exigency Voting:
</I>&gt;<i> If a majority of an established quorum decides the proposal is both urgent
</I>&gt;<i> and crucial, they may pass a proposal with an exigency vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This I predict would be the default operating mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe so. Again, looking for the middle ground. Perhaps there needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> some distinctive definition of &#8220;urgent and crucial&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, if your goal is to preserve that land as open space, allowing
</I>&gt;<i> blocks is a great way to achieve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My thinking is that allowing &#8220;blocks&#8221;...along side the ability of the
</I>&gt;<i> membership to expel someone who uses them irresponsibly should limit their
</I>&gt;<i> abuse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing I see missing is some mention of the &quot;executive
</I>&gt;<i> branch&quot;.  As you may know from my book, I consider how Managers are
</I>&gt;<i> chosen and an enumeration of their powers to be a key feature of how
</I>&gt;<i> successful organizations actually operate.  They have to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> make and implement the small decisions themselves, but there there has
</I>&gt;<i> to be built-in authority for the group to override and even replace
</I>&gt;<i> them if the need arises.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, our Food Coop has a store manager who answers to the BOD.
</I>&gt;<i> The hybrid seems to be working pretty well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do keep us posted as to the progress of this proposal, if only to
</I>&gt;<i> inform us when they decide to follow some lawyer's advice to structure
</I>&gt;<i> it like any other HOA ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Grin. There it is again.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your feedback Scott, I do appreciate it.
