<PRE>Hi Scott,
my proposal was not to just use Vilfredo, but when I presented it, it also
included HOW to actually write something in the Home Page at each
generation. If we did follow my proposal we would not be in this situation.
The proposal was turned down, but we kept on using Vilfredo with the hope
that it would bring us to a consensus. Vilfredo does not always reach a
consensus (as Condorcet, by the way. Some Condorcet system do, but not all
of them), but please do not accuse Vilfredo for the result. It is a tool,
you need to know how to use it. And if you do not reach a consensus you
need to know beforehand what will you do.

Yes, in this group we all share the dream of building some tool that permit
a democratic discussion. So the merging of discussions and voting. You
might not share this dream. Fine. But do not protest if we do not feel like
following you into applying just a simple majority voting. Why would we be
voting for this proposal on Loomio instead than another? Who writes the
option to vote have a lot of power. You have not addressed that, and
instead insist that people here would vote for metamerman proposal.

I think the really good decision is:
we all suggest a decision system, we then vote using an ordered ballot and
counting using a Condorcet system, and then we do what we have voted.

You want to use Loomio, suggest that. I want to use Vilfredo in a specific
way? I will suggest that. Ned wants to use Vilfredo in another way. Fine.
Jacopo will suggest Airesis. And Michal will suggest his groups and or a
delphi system.

It seemed to me that we were slowly achieving a consensus on this idea,
which is why I will right now vote against any other process that will try
to shortcut this. So I voted No both on Loomio and to Michael groups.

&gt;<i> Groups No!  Looks to me like you're just kicking the can down the road.
</I>&gt;<i>  Assuming you can even get multiple groups (which I doubt), how would you
</I>&gt;<i> integrate the results?  It'd end up just like the Vilfredo experiment: Lots
</I>&gt;<i> of candidate material, no decision.  Process rather than results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking of which, for those who aren't on Loomio, the Loomio vote for my
</I>&gt;<i> Home Page proposal failed 3 to 2.  None of the 3 no votes made any comment
</I>&gt;<i> about *why* they voted no other than a vague claim that it wasn't proper
</I>&gt;<i> procedure to even hold a vote.  Which puzzles me.  I've read thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> pages of the research in this area over the last few months and yet never
</I>&gt;<i> came across a single case like we have here where people insist on voting
</I>&gt;<i> on the voting method before they vote on any particular issue.  Voting
</I>&gt;<i> systems like Condorcet and Borda are *optimizations*, and will not
</I>&gt;<i> fundamentally alter the decisionmaking process.  Indeed, I'd be willing to
</I>&gt;<i> bet that we'd come up with the same decision voting on each proposal
</I>&gt;<i> separately on Loomio and just picking the one with the most yes votes.
</I>&gt;<i>  Especially considering the main benefit of these other voting algorithms
</I>&gt;<i> is to thwart people trying to game the system by appealing to a subset of
</I>&gt;<i> the voters and relying on &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; to deal with the rest
</I>&gt;<i> (none of us are trying to game this Home Page decision, are we?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since none of them will deign to explain the justification for their
</I>&gt;<i> behavior I have very little to go on, but my gut tells me that the main
</I>&gt;<i> problem is still the fantasy about collaborative government and consensus,
</I>&gt;<i> disagreement about which is the very reason why the Home page was taken
</I>&gt;<i> down.  It also explains why Loomio gets such short shrift because it just
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't even claim to support either even though it would work fine (albeit
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat inefficiently) for any decision we have to make.  As I see it our
</I>&gt;<i> main problem is not choosing a voting method, it's that members of this
</I>&gt;<i> group can't even agree on what it means to make a group decision.  A
</I>&gt;<i> secondary problem being that those members who insist on
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration/consensus *also* refuse to debate that issue (e.g., *why*
</I>&gt;<i> isn't a vote on Loomio binding?) or indeed the issue of whether or not the
</I>&gt;<i> old decision rule (80% majority according to Ed) is even still in effect.
</I>&gt;<i>  Propose all the clever things you want, but if you're not willing to face
</I>&gt;<i> the facts about human behavior (even *our* behavior) this group will
</I>&gt;<i> continue to shed members who actually value getting things done over
</I>&gt;<i> handwaving, in which case we might as well ask Ed to just take down the
</I>&gt;<i> site and sell the domain to somebody who actually wants to use it for
</I>&gt;<i> something productive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for Airesis, I'm willing to give that a try, but as I told Jacopo
</I>&gt;<i> previously, it didn't seem to be working correctly last time I tried it,
</I>&gt;<i> and the language barrier goes both ways (certainly his English is vastly
</I>&gt;<i> superior to my Italian!)  If he wants to run a full beta-test of the
</I>&gt;<i> software, count me in, but *he* will have to organize it and lead us
</I>&gt;<i> through the process or it just isn't going to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another proposal: It occurs to me that another one of our problems a sort
</I>&gt;<i> of reverse Luddism, where we seem to be expecting some fancy new software
</I>&gt;<i> to magically reach inside each of our brains and extract (or worse,
</I>&gt;<i> manufacture) consensus.  Ain't going to happen.  There are few enough
</I>&gt;<i> people involved now we could collaboratively design the Home Page using
</I>&gt;<i> just this mailing list, each of us just posting our requirements (as I have
</I>&gt;<i> done *twice* now) and any one of us integrating the result to be confirmed
</I>&gt;<i> with another mailing-list vote.  If you agree, please post your list and
</I>&gt;<i> I'll volunteer to integrate with the understanding that anyone who
</I>&gt;<i> *doesn't* post their list has exercised their right to not vote and so we
</I>&gt;<i> therefore have a mandate to make a binding decision without them.  The only
</I>&gt;<i> remaining issue would be to establish quorum, which I'd propose to use a
</I>&gt;<i> majority of the people who have posted to the list in the last 2 months
</I>&gt;<i> (since the Home Page decision came up).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
