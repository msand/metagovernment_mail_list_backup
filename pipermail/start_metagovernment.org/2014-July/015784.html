Yeah, that's the thing isn't it?  I never voted for the 80% rule
either, and hope that I was never naive enough to even do such a
thing.  But now Ed says we're stuck with it, like it or not.  Is that
democracy?

&gt;<i> Counting votes transforms popularity into power, without reason/discourse
</I>&gt;<i> playing any formal part in the process: mob rule.
</I>
This applies to representative democracy, sure, but it's hard to see
how people voting directly for a law that affects them too is an
example of &quot;mob rule&quot;.  Voting is a necessary part of the process of
reaching, or at least verifying, a decision.  Without it, we're left
with a bunch of unfinished business (Exhibit A being the MG Home
Page).  You can join Ed in the category &quot;more interested in process
than in results&quot;.  I'll occupy the other category, thank you very
much, and we'll just see which of the two philosophies results in the
Home Page getting redone.
  Regards,
    Scott
