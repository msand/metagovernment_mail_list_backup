<PRE>Vilfredo 2.0 will return a ranked order of the proposals. It is already
planned and all the necessary math elements to make this possible are in
place.

Speaking about the irony, I think it is not just an irony, but a sign of
our work. In normal systems one persone decides the system to use. Or
people fight a bit and someone imposes a decision by authority. We are a
group, where each of us has his own idea of how we should proceed. How can
we possibly agree?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dunno about the better system.  A google search returned this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.openstv.org/,">http://www.openstv.org/,</A> which seems to allow us to create a web based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instant runoff vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nice system.  We should definitely run an election on it sometime to
</I>&gt;<i> put it through its paces.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think this would be preferable to voting on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; competing proposals yes/no one at a time, which doesn't properly frame
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree, at least for this particular vote.  Evaluating
</I>&gt;<i> proposal-by-proposal is definitely less efficient than being able to
</I>&gt;<i> rank order them (something I suggested earlier as a feature for
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo) but this is the *only* method that is guaranteed to provide
</I>&gt;<i> a decision acceptable to the majority.  The problem with rank ordering
</I>&gt;<i> is that the top vote getter will be installed even if everyone thinks
</I>&gt;<i> it sucks.  Better to be able to just reject the proposal outright, and
</I>&gt;<i> modify it or start over if that happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Concerning the irony, I agree, it's delicious.  Reinforcing a past
</I>&gt;<i> point, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think deliberation and decision are separate steps in a process, and
</I>&gt;<i> we're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; muddling them together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, which is what my system will do: During the creation phase
</I>&gt;<i> only the most interested parties will rate and comment on a proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> which may be modified to improve it.  During the vote phase, the
</I>&gt;<i> previous ratings and comments can be used by the majority of the
</I>&gt;<i> population to evaluate the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I request that you and Ned redo your votes: If you object to the
</I>&gt;<i> *process* and don't want to legitimize it, change your vote to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;abstain&quot; (since there is no way to &quot;unvote&quot; on Loomio).  If you
</I>&gt;<i> object to particular features of my proposal, please follow the
</I>&gt;<i> instructions in the proposal and in the announcement letter and vote
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;no&quot; and include a comment as to why.  The idea of updating a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> while it's being voted on is kind of wiggly, but it's the system I
</I>&gt;<i> (and Loomio) defined and you'll just have to trust that I won't pull a
</I>&gt;<i> fast one and totally replace the content one second before the vote
</I>&gt;<i> closes (and if I do, I'd expect someone to immediately make another
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to replace it, which would be an example of cycling or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;flapping&quot;, but that is a superior mode to be operating in than the
</I>&gt;<i> current &quot;noop&quot; mode).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
