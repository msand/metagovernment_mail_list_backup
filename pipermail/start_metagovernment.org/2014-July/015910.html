Here's mine!

(snip)

&gt;<i> To become a member of this Organization one must receive an invitation
</I>&gt;<i> (approved by a majority of the existing members of Organization) in order to
</I>&gt;<i> register with *the Beta Council*. One's membership may be revoked at any
</I>&gt;<i> time by a majority vote of the Organization.
</I>
Simple majority?  So if I have a majority for my position I can game
the system by accumulating the other (roughly) 16% by adding shills?

&gt;<i> *the Beta Council*:
</I>&gt;<i> *the Beta Council* is a proposal introduction and approval *protocol*
</I>&gt;<i> supported by an online decision-making mechanism with a database (currently
</I>&gt;<i> being hosted on Loomio.org).
</I>
I'd recommend leaving any mention of specific technology out of this
document.  You need to be able to run a meeting face to face with
&quot;raise of hands&quot; votes.  Anything beyond that is an optimization that
you need to be able to change easily depending on future developments
(like Loomio goes under and the nearest replacement you can find
doesn't have some feature you've written in).

&gt;<i> Proposals must be clear, concise, and itemized if lengthy. They may be
</I>&gt;<i> revised or amended [and then re-stated by the original proposer(s)] at any
</I>&gt;<i> point during the discussion phase of the process. Anytime a proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> substantially altered, the revised proposal must be re-initiated through
</I>&gt;<i> *the Beta Council* and a new quorum must then be established. The original
</I>&gt;<i> proposer(s) may revoke their proposal at anytime prior to a binding vote on
</I>&gt;<i> their proposal.
</I>
I'm still thinking two-phase for this process: The proposal gets rated
and approved by a special interest group during which the proposer can
change it at any time (sparing making the determination of
&quot;substantially altered&quot; and consequent squabbling about whether a
proposal is valid or not, and the issue of quorum).  Once that group
somehow decides it's ready (and I would leave that to the group and
primarily the original proposer), they submit it to a vote of the full
membership during which it can't be altered.

&gt;<i> Quorum:
</I>&gt;<i> The quorum necessary for the passage of a proposal is comprised of all
</I>&gt;<i> members (of the Organization) who are active in the discussion and voting
</I>&gt;<i> process after one week following notification of the proposal. Quorums can
</I>&gt;<i> be established in less than one week if all members of the Organization
</I>&gt;<i> agree to do so.
</I>
I still like my &quot;25% yes votes&quot; quorum rule.  With your proposed
policy, I predict people trying to game the system by holding a vote
between Christmas and New Year's or during a power outage (or
whatever), and passing something with a tiny fraction of the
membership.

&gt;<i> Notification:
</I>&gt;<i> Notification of a proposal must be given to all members (of the
</I>&gt;<i> Organization) immediately following introduction of the proposal. This
</I>&gt;<i> notification must be easily verifiable and recorded in an online database
</I>&gt;<i> that is readily accessible to all.
</I>
This one's tough.  Would simply sending an email be sufficient?  I'm
inclined to use time in my system.  Maybe have all votes close on the
1st of the month.  Send an email to remind people, but if that email
gets spam filtered or whatever you still have a binding vote because
they should *know* to log in and check if something is running (I'm
thinking Sunday evening closing, but then I'm anticipating a much
busier government system).

&gt;<i> Proxy:
</I>&gt;<i> If a member is unable to participate in the discussion and voting of any
</I>&gt;<i> given proposal, or will be out of reach for any (reasonable) period of time,
</I>&gt;<i> and would like to be represented during their absence, they may select any
</I>&gt;<i> other member to be their proxy. The member selecting a proxy must notify the
</I>&gt;<i> Organization of their choice for proxy, as well as the proposal, or period
</I>&gt;<i> of time, for which they will be absent.
</I>
Good, although Loomio doesn't support this.  And I'd change
&quot;organization&quot; to &quot;other members&quot;.  I.e., there should be a &quot;proxies
given&quot; section on the voting site so that everyone knows who's done
what.

&gt;<i> Discussion:
</I>&gt;<i> Discussion of a proposal may begin immediately following notification. Once
</I>&gt;<i> a quorum has been established, the discussion will remain open until there
</I>&gt;<i> are no unresolved objections.  If and when this occurs, any member of the
</I>&gt;<i> quorum may call for a vote of consensus.
</I>
You know my position on this one: If your (or really anyone's) purpose
is to preserve the target property as undeveloped open space, this is
the way to achieve it.

&gt;<i> Exigency Voting:
</I>&gt;<i> If a majority of an established quorum decides the proposal is both urgent
</I>&gt;<i> and crucial, they may pass a proposal with an exigency vote.
</I>&gt;<i> Any member may make a claim for an exigency vote following the establishment
</I>&gt;<i> of a quorum for that specific proposal. If a majority of the established
</I>&gt;<i> quorum agrees with the exigency claim, the quorum may then vote on the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal. The proposal will move forward if a majority of the quorum agrees
</I>&gt;<i> to:
</I>&gt;<i> support the proposal (thumbs up)
</I>&gt;<i> and/or
</I>&gt;<i> abstain from non-support (thumbs to the side).
</I>
This I predict would be the default operating mode.  If a vote made
this way is binding, why even bring up consensus?  While there would
theoretically be some benefit for enforcement/compliance in proposals
passing by large majorities (i.e., people are more likely to follow
laws that they themselves voted for), I see no benefit to your
organization.

&gt;<i> Blocking:
</I>&gt;<i> An exigency claim will not move forward by a majority vote if at least (n)
</I>&gt;<i> member(s) of the quorum feel compelled to block it's passage.
</I>&gt;<i> n = (1) member for a quorum of &lt; or = 10 members.
</I>&gt;<i> n = (2) members for a quorum of quorum 11 to 20 members.
</I>&gt;<i> n = (3) members for a quorum of quorum 21 to 30 members.
</I>&gt;<i> and so on...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blocking a proposal is a very serious action and should only be used when
</I>&gt;<i> ones feels their participation in the Organization would be ethically
</I>&gt;<i> compromised should the proposal be accepted through a binding vote.  Any
</I>&gt;<i> member(s) blocking a proposal must present a reasonable and detailed account
</I>&gt;<i> of their rationale for this obstruction.
</I>
Has anyone done a statistical analysis of the percentage of votes that
fail on Loomio due to blocking?  Although maybe we can't even tell
because some users may simply count blocks as &quot;no&quot; votes (as I set out
in the rules for my last proposal there).

Again, if your goal is to preserve that land as open space, allowing
blocks is a great way to achieve it.

The only thing I see missing is some mention of the &quot;executive
branch&quot;.  As you may know from my book, I consider how Managers are
chosen and an enumeration of their powers to be a key feature of how
successful organizations actually operate.  They have to be able to
make and implement the small decisions themselves, but there there has
to be built-in authority for the group to override and even replace
them if the need arises.

Do keep us posted as to the progress of this proposal, if only to
inform us when they decide to follow some lawyer's advice to structure
it like any other HOA ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
