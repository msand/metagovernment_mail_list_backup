<PRE>Thanks for the response Ned.

I changed the subject line, so we don't discuss on that thread which is
used for that one proposal.

&gt;<i>From you mail I understand you say that each question is different. And
</I>there is no algorithmic way around human evaluation of the case by case. I
can agree with that (notice how Vilfredo does not employ any natural
language processing technique). But still there is a need to create a
dialogue between Vilfredo and the community, so the community communicates
to Vilfredo if they wish to go on, or have the final result. And when.

I now suspect that people should be allowed to say when they would like to
see the results if no proposals appear. And then we take the median. In all
this how we administer a question is a simpler problem than how we answer
it. So once it is written, it should be possible for the community to self
administer it (even thought you did an egregious job).

And it IS necessary to send reminders from time to time. Vilfredo
participation really changed when we set that up correctly. The problem is
how and how much. But some are inevitable. Some questions don't need it,
but most questions do.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Interesting position, Ned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I have two questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1) How would you make sure that the people participating do not forget a
</I>&gt;<i> question?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each question has its own context. In this case, what makes sure that this
</I>&gt;<i> particular question will not be forgotten is that the Home Page is still
</I>&gt;<i> blank.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Should Vilfredo send them weekly reminders?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For this particular question, I think that the best sort of &quot;reminder
</I>&gt;<i> method&quot; is what just happened: Mike made inquiry, and now everyone
</I>&gt;<i> monitoring the list is aware that Proposal 2 is &quot;still kicking&quot; on Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also, I think that neither Vilfredo nor any other software system can
</I>&gt;<i> do the thinking and the writing of synthesis for us. We still need to sit
</I>&gt;<i> down and think, and write. (Voting and writing are two entirely different
</I>&gt;<i> things.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   How could this be done without it becoming a spam abuse?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though there may be exceptions, in general I don't think that Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> should &quot;remind&quot;. The actual motivations for most questions are extrinsic to
</I>&gt;<i> the Vilfredo process (as is the case with the Home Page). People will work
</I>&gt;<i> when they have time, and are otherwise motivated to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Obviously you understand that not every question will always have a
</I>&gt;<i> consensual answer on which everybody agrees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do. And in that case, a win would be to have a clear understanding of
</I>&gt;<i> exactly what the irreconcilable differences are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of Proposal 2, we have two different introductions at odds
</I>&gt;<i> (2712 vs. 2753), and we have &quot;introduction only&quot; at odds with &quot;introduction
</I>&gt;<i> plus&quot;. (Neither of those differences seem terminal to me -- we'll see ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Sometimes Vilfredo's work is successful in finding the set of best
</I>&gt;<i> candidates representing the participants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this case, I don't think that we are there yet. We need some more
</I>&gt;<i> proposals that attempt synthesis, and that go beyond the comfortable safety
</I>&gt;<i> of the introduction and &quot;jump into metagovernment&quot;: discussing what we are
</I>&gt;<i> and what we do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   In Vilfredo2.0 Vilfredo will take the hint that no one has anything to
</I>&gt;<i> add, to take all the information it has gathered so far, and use it to
</I>&gt;<i> provide a final ordering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the Forces of Mordor are attacking the Northern Frontier, the
</I>&gt;<i> decision system cannot afford to dither around. But the question of what
</I>&gt;<i> should go on the Home Page is not seated in that sort of context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, the context is arguably of an opposite type: through the process
</I>&gt;<i> of reaching agreement on the Home Page content, we reach agreement
</I>&gt;<i> regarding what sort of group we are, and what our work is. The specific
</I>&gt;<i> question serves a broader end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have recently had two (to me) really great articles posted to the list:
</I>&gt;<i> The Valve Cabal:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131815/the_cabal_valves_design_process_.php">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131815/the_cabal_valves_design_process_.php</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Disputation Arenas:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html">http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, it seems that Metagovernment has in fact become a very general
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;disputation arena&quot; for the e-democracy field, mainly because the term
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;metagovernment&quot; is so darned expansive. (If the group were named
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;community voting systems&quot;, it would not have been nearly so effective at
</I>&gt;<i> attracting people looking to test their outlandish ideas through
</I>&gt;<i> far-ranging discourse with peers.) And, I see that as a Very Good Thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Home Page is where we own that reality, or not. (Disputation Arena, or
</I>&gt;<i> not?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also, the process through which we decide the Home Page question is
</I>&gt;<i> where we &quot;walk our talk&quot;, or not. (Valve-Cabal, or not? Consensus through
</I>&gt;<i> Synthesis, or not?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   But it looks like you probably would not like this solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In some cases: yes, in other cases: no. Specifically with respect to the
</I>&gt;<i> Home Page question, definitely not. I would see it as wasting the valuable
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity that blanking the Home Page has created.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   How would you rather see the questions end up?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each question has its own context. One size does not fit all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   How should Vilfredo distinguish when the community just is sleeping,
</I>&gt;<i> and when the search has ended?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that there is an algorithmic way to make that distinction.
</I>&gt;<i> In each case, we will need to look and see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this particular case, my view is that the community is not sleeping,
</I>&gt;<i> and that the search has not ended, and that we are going to need to &quot;step
</I>&gt;<i> up our game&quot; to resolve the matter. Maybe we will, maybe not.
</I>&gt;<i>
