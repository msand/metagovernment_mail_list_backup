I guess you're suggesting a database facility that relates people to
the issues (causes and such) they support.  I don't understand what
you mean by &quot;requirement set&quot;, however.

&gt;<i> Notice however that I am not in a step mode here.  I am more looking
</I>&gt;<i> at potential resources to pull into a collaboration.
</I>
We'd look in the database for common issues and there discover
possibilities for collaboration.

You're not in a step mode, but we're looking for a way forward.  Do
you think this database is something we immediately need in order to
move forward in democracy, etc.?

</I>&gt;<i> I think you did very well here and in the last sort of catalog post.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought of something to say.  Potentially multiple somethings.
</I>&gt;<i> I clicked on the link you provided.
</I>&gt;<i> I got to the list of names of participants.
</I>&gt;<i> I came back here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What i would like to see is a linkage such that i can get to multiple page
</I>&gt;<i> from my name.  Each page would have a &quot;good thing&quot; I would be supportive
</I>&gt;<i> of.  And why.  With the way it relates to your requirement set.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let us then see what we get after a bit.  I am thinking of a few words for
</I>&gt;<i> each page title and maybe these can eventually be linked from a list of
</I>&gt;<i> titles.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the first thing that came to mind for an example
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Support libraries
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Provide Internet connectivity to 30% of USA population
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Provide research facilities to many people
</I>
