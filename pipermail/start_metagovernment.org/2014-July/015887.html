I'm confused: Aren't those two things contradictory?

As for the decision method, I don't really care and believe that any
of them will work with the obvious exception of Vilfredo which simply
isn't designed to render *a* decision.  Certainly voting on them
individually is less efficient, but it takes, what, 5 seconds to vote
on Loomio?  So I don't see the problem with just running through them
in any order on Loomio.  The only problem I see is if we tried to run
through them simultaneously or in parallel with an email vote instead
of sequentially.

But I also support the proposal to use Opavote, particularly if you
can get access to the entire mailing list, the only caveat being that
I'm not willing to organize it.  The only downside I see to Opavote is
that it is not designed to allow updating the proposals on the fly,
which could have worked on my proposal on Loomio except for the fact
that no one bothered to actually comment on the merits of the proposal
itself...
  Regards,
    Scott
