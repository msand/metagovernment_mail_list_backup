<PRE>One more&#8230;.then I seriously have to get away from this hungry beast and go camping for a few days.

The debate is still thumping along as to whether there's any real *choosing*&#8230;.and science seems to be saying that  &quot;physical reality&#8221; is merely a complex [manifestation] of vibrating song lines&#8230;.and the stories we tell about them.
I prefer to move from my heart. The world doesn&#8217;t really need saving. But the contemporary cultural memes of homo rapiens seriously disturb my &#8220;aesthetic&#8221; sensibilities.
So I put on my clever monkey hat, and move as if the dance I do makes a difference.  (In my mind, the juries still out on that.)
But that doesn&#8217;t much matter.  As long as I&#8217;m showing up in this dimension of tension opposition  + - + - + -  I  might as well tell a good story about it and get on with making fun and beauty and love, when and wherever possible.
In my (heart) mind, it&#8217;s all cosmological manifestation.   
My assignment is to get really good at it.  :)
