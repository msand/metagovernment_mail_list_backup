Ah, the light bulb comes on!  For one of you anyway. This is exactly
what I've been talking about for the last couple of months: A way to
provide feedback so that the Cephu's of this world feel the social
pressure, whether it be a rating system applied to their posts, or the
feedback that comes when they simply see during a real-time vote that
their position is outside the mainstream.  Both of these things will
cause them to modify their positions (or perhaps just self-censor)
allowing the Neurotypicals to run the show.  The great thing about
this being that it is self-reinforcing: When there is a lower level of
fear (brought about by everyone's increased confidence that the
Neurotypicals *do* in fact know what they're doing) research has shown
that even the authoritarians will start to act more rationally (so,
fewer trolls!)

That article is a good summary of the anthropological work in this
area, but I think really needs to be integrated with Altemeyer's work
on authoritarianism to get the complete picture: The influence of
inter-band competition is simply omitted from Boehm's book, yet I
believe it has had a profound influence on our evolution and explains
why Cephu has simply not been bred out of us.
