<PRE>Hi Henri,

&gt;<i> ... But I will succeed to open the BIG door for humanity. That is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty sure. ...
</I>
If you think of practical steps for opening that door, then please
come back and share them.

&gt;<i> ... And as we talk about assuredness.  What do you think makes me
</I>&gt;<i> able to know I found the democracy?
</I>
Maybe your assurance comes from theory, like mine.  Not many people
understand theory, however, so it can be difficult to communicate.

Mike

&gt;<i> Hi Mike.
</I>&gt;<i> As I just said to Paul I should fastly leave this list. I dont know what
</I>&gt;<i> you mean with participatory democracy. Democracy is already very much about
</I>&gt;<i> participation. I spent ten years to search an ideal form and understanding
</I>&gt;<i> of democracy. And I found it. What pretty much renders me as a genius. I am
</I>&gt;<i> not too good in working with people. But I will succeed to open the BIG
</I>&gt;<i> door for humanity. That is pretty sure. And as we talk about assuredness.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think makes me able to know I found the democracy?
</I>&gt;<i> Take care.
</I>&gt;<i> Henri
