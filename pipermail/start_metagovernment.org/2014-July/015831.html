Where I live in Ashland Oregon we have a very successful food co-op with an elected Board of Directors. (Sales for 2013 were well over $28 million.) The Board of Directors uses consensus with a  clause in their bi-laws which permits them to resort to a 3/4 majority *emergency* vote should they not be able to reach consensus on a timely and critical matter. I spoke with the president of the Board several months ago and she said that (up to that date) the BOD had not found it necessary to resort to a 3/4 majority emergency vote.   We recently had our 40th anniversary.

Even though I believe this to be exemplary, I am not suggesting in sharing this that I&#8217;m a proponent of the consensus model for every situation. I think the success of any decision making process depends solely on the level of *coherence* a group can rise to in order to achieve a productive working agreement. The greater the polarity within any given group, the less likely they are to find the requisite unity (or coherence) for consensus. And as I see it, without the possibility of consensus, democracy becomes *political*, and some form of majority voting is then employed (just to get the job done) so the group can move on.

In my mind, the preponderant question is: *What creates coherence?*

The Ashland Food Coop has a very clear vision/mission that&#8217;s passionately shared by it's general membership. There is a very high level of unified orientation and I would imagine decision making for the BOD is relatively simple, quick, and easy. 

It seems to me that with [MG], (as with many organizations), our level of coherence is relatively low. Any shared vision we may have is vague, dissembled, and amorphous. It&#8217;s striking to me that after so many years we are still trying to create a home page that resonates with even a minority of those on the list. I wonder if it&#8217;s necessary, (or even possible), for [MG] to have a mission other than, very simply, &#8220;to provide a forum to discuss, challenge, and debate various systems and practices of (e)democracy&#8221;. 

The fact that we cannot even agree on how we are going to agree is remarkable to me. I&#8217;m beginning to conclude that this list just isn't the venue for that. 

I wonder if maybe our (implicit) agreement is to continually (and relentlessly) *disagree*&#8230;..and in so doing, to force the most fundamental or primary elements of some *as yet unknown and emergent* democracy towards the surface of our contemporary human governance.  

I think I could be ok with that. However disjointed and dysfunctional our deliberations appear to be&#8230;..it seems to be working on some deeper level for me.  ;-)
