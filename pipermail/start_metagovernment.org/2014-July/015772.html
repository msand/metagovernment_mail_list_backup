<PRE>Hi Michael,
I also think the 2712 is a good candidate, but it is incorrect to recover
something from a past generation and ignore everything that happened after.
Also the last generations did not have so many people voting, so we do not
know how many people would have voted for those proposals. People simply
is, as you said, &quot;dog-tired&quot; :-) .

If you think 2712 should be on the table, then propose it.
If you look 2712 was not supported by Ed, but 2712 rewrite: 2753 is very
similar to 2712, but is also supported by Ed. (Ed is not special person, it
is in this case just representative of the few people that did not like
2712.

So my suggestion is this:

we do one last round. You repropose 2712, and through voting we make sure
that 2712 is in the Pareto Front. Ned, you maybe could write your idea of
the Arena? That sounds interesting, but never got accepted.

And then we vote on ALL the proposals in the Pareto Front.

Michael, in this vote the &quot;none of the above&quot; would not be there, also
because it is not clear what should be done in that case. If you have a
specific idea (
&quot;we remain with the empty homepage&quot;, or
&quot;Vilfredo failed, we use Votorola&quot;, or
&quot;Vilfredo Failed we continue the discussion on the list&quot;
), just suggest specifically what we should do. Remember you can write as
many proposals as you want.

The voting is done among all the proposals in the Pareto Front, using
Majority Judgment.
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_Judgment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_Judgment</A>
Which is a REALLY good system.
(I can write a long post about why we should use that very often)

Instead of asking who supports this, let me ask,
has anyone strong objections against this? Is anyone putting a veto?

(Ned, I know you would rather wait, but Ed is simply too busy,
and I somehow would rather not see the homepage empty too long)

Pietro
