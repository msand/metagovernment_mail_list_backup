While I've got Ned on the ropes here, I'll get a few more shots in ;-)

This is exactly my point: A process that involves endless debate is
IMHO simply unworkable because the whole *point* of government is
making decisions.  The fact that you don't have time for the debate on
the Home page (or the MG decision rule) is just a microcosm of what
it's like for real people out in the real world.  By requiring massive
time investment, these consensus-seeking systems just either fail to
deliver a decision, or at best delegate the decision to those who
simply have time to debate, regardless of their skill in whatever
domain the decision lies in.  It's time to give up on this fantasy
that a real government can operate on consensus and start using Loomio
or other simpler tools to make a decision because only they can
*guarantee* that some decision will be made.  Until you and Ed (and
whoever else wants to be in the &quot;process over results&quot; camp) realize
(and admit) that, I'm thinking we should at least leave the Home page
blank if not replace it with statement that this project has failed
and that people should look elsewhere for information on alternative
forms of government.
  Regards,
    Scott
