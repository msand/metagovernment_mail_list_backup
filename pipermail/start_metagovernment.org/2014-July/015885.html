<PRE>I regret that I am still too busy to come out and play, so this will 
have to be just a quick note with no followup:  as a &quot;necessary&quot; 
precursor, could we list and ranked-choice vote on all of the ways that 
we might potentially go about bringing the Home Page project to 
fruition? My preference would be that we continue in Vilfredo. Scott's 
preference is that we up/down vote on one text at a time on Loomio until 
one wins. Mark's preference is that we gather the texts that we have and 
then ranked-choice vote on them. Jacopo's preference is that we use 
Airesis, and so on.

I for one would find the list and the outcome of that ranked-choice vote 
(on how to decide) of more interest that the vote on home page texts. 
(We demonstrate our competence as a governance research/discussion group 
through HOW we decide, not through WHAT we decide, as far as the Home 
Page text.)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A process that I don&#8217;t think works is voting alternatives up or down 
</I>&gt;<i> one at a time (as has been attempted on Loomio). This would be similar 
</I>&gt;<i> to asking a child &#8220;Do you want cake?&#8221; and &#8220;Do you want ice cream?&#8221;. 
</I>&gt;<i> The more appropriate question is &#8220;Do you want cake _OR_ ice cream?&#8221;. 
</I>&gt;<i> The child doesn&#8217;t get two desserts, and we can&#8217;t have more than one 
</I>&gt;<i> description on the homepage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, we&#8217;ll need to decide what how to use to choose between a set of 
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives. I personally like the idea of ranked choice voting, and 
</I>&gt;<i> suggested the possibility of using <A HREF="http://www.opavote.org.">http://www.opavote.org.</A> Digging 
</I>&gt;<i> into it, it appears suitable for our purpose, except that it&#8217;s 
</I>&gt;<i> designed for candidates rather than documents. To use it we might post 
</I>&gt;<i> links to the text of all of the alternatives on the homepage, giving 
</I>&gt;<i> each a short, descriptive name, then below that linking to the voting 
</I>&gt;<i> tool, which would use the same descriptive names as &#8220;candidates&#8221; in 
</I>&gt;<i> the election. The software allows for the election to last 7 days 
</I>&gt;<i> without charge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we decide to pursue this approach, I&#8217;d suggest we allow 7 days to 
</I>&gt;<i> gather all current formulations from Vilfredo, Loomio, etc. and list 
</I>&gt;<i> them on the homepage. Then allow 7 days for the election itself. If we 
</I>&gt;<i> agree to this approach, we&#8217;d have new text for the homepage within two 
</I>&gt;<i> weeks of our start date.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do folks think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
