&gt;<i> I'm confused: Which of these &quot;islands&quot; is shown on the Home page?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

If a proposal is created and 5 people support it. The &quot;island&quot; consists of
5 people and the rule can be binding for them.
(contract law) or it could also be seen as &quot;moraly binding&quot;.
If 10 proposals pop into existance, each supported by 5 people, that
translates then into 10 &quot;islands&quot; each with 5 people.
If 2 &quot;islands&quot; decide to work an a proposal which is then supported by all
people on those islands, then the 10 &quot;islands&quot; are ideally reduced to 9
islands, where one of the 9 islands has now 10 supporters, because 2
islands merged into 1.

Of course, maybe the &quot;proposal&quot; that merged 2 islands into one, reducing
the total amount of islands from 10 to 9, doesnt manage to do so, but
instead convinced 4 people of island A and 3 people of island B, then
afterwards, its 11 islands, but now one of those 11 islands has 7
supporters and two others have 2 and 1 supporters.

Maybe those remaining supporters are hardliners or maybe they start attract
new supporters or refine their proposal ...to something more specific, that
caters more to their needs then what was possible when they were still 5...


Who knows what this all grows into.
what do you mean with &quot;gridlock&quot; or &quot;status quo&quot; in the above described
context?





&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, the purpose of government is to enable collective
</I>&gt;<i> decisionmaking.  Without decisionmaking, there is no government.
</I>


Decisionmaking is meaningless without &quot;Scope&quot;.
What is the scope of the decision? This is what i wanted to question with
above example...



&gt;<i> Now
</I>&gt;<i> that this home page project has clearly shown that this is the case,
</I>&gt;<i> can we get back to the business of government by making a decision
</I>&gt;<i> about what to put on it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

If we follow the above mentioned process, we should do two things:
1. come up with multiple decisions, each of which has 100% consensus, which
means, &quot;worst case&quot; we come up with as many decisions as we are partcipants
in this discussion + we need then equally many &quot;metagovernment front pages&quot;
and maybe the frontpage should be nothing more than a LIST of those many
FRONT PAGES.

Maybe if one &quot;FRONT PAGE&quot; has more support, it shows up further on top of
that list of &quot;FRONT PAGES&quot; which would give motivation to continue the
discussion to &quot;unite&quot; the &quot;FRONT PAGES&quot; :-)

...so each of us could or could not participate in the discussion and
nobody could block anyone else by not participating or being against a
proposal... what do you think?




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't do any revisions during the Vilfredo experiment (for fear of
</I>&gt;<i> sending it even farther afield), but I'll now volunteer to do one of
</I>&gt;<i> my own and will set up a vote on Loomio to get it approved. Look for
</I>&gt;<i> it in a day or two.  We'll use the decision rule (simple majority plus
</I>&gt;<i> at least 1/3 of registered voters vote yes) that was previously
</I>&gt;<i> approved on Loomio because I believe it will work not only on
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarians but also on the &quot;consensus&quot; contingent of this group.
</I>&gt;<i> Both groups are unreasonable to the point of being irrational and it
</I>&gt;<i> will be a good test of the decision rule to see if a decision can be
</I>&gt;<i> reached despite these types of disruptive influences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mean time, I welcome any debate on the terms &quot;collaboration&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consensus&quot;: I've made my position clear many times but have yet to
</I>&gt;<i> see a coherent response to my claim that these are simply unreachable
</I>&gt;<i> goals for government at any level.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it is impossible to &quot;UNITE&quot; all people upfront, thus i vote

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the proposal to have a majority of 65% or 80% or something else.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The whole approach is flawed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My belief is, that oppinions are many and the best which is possible is,
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; come up with a proposal and find someone to support that proposal
</I>&gt;<i> forever,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; until he decided to &quot;withdraw&quot; his support it is legit forever.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To give everyone the possibility to maintain an overview over all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;supported proposals&quot;, one maintains his own profile page, which can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hosted by METAGOVERNMENT, but also adheres to a certain &quot;data format&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be CRAWLED, so everyone is free to close their metagovernment hosted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; profile and instead upload their proposals in that &quot;data format&quot; (I
</I>&gt;<i> propose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a GIT REPOSITORY), to their website or github and afterwards to ADD that
</I>&gt;<i> new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; URL to the CRAWLER.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Therefore consensus can be reached among all supporters of a proposal and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its legit only amongst them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This process will build many &quot;islands of local consensus&quot; which can then
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grown into bigger islands through discussion, eventually growing into a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; planet of consensus.
