<PRE>(Please reply to this thread, not the other.  I forgot the mandatory
proposal number in the subject of the other.)

The text proposed here was written by Ned based on a previous text by
Bentley.  It came from Vilfredo.  Of all the texts in Vilfredo, it
attracted the most support; 8 people in generation four: (see 2712)

   PROPOSAL 8
   ----------
   Replace the content of the home page with the following:

      *Better Lives Through Better Decisions*

      Globally, tens of millions of public-matter decisions are made
      each year.  Those decisions affect the quality of our lives, the
      health of our biosphere, and the welfare of future generations.

        * We want those decisions to be of the highest quality.
        * We want to have the option of being directly involved in
          making them.
        * We want to use technology to work on issues together when it
          is convenient for us.
        * We want to explore new ways of having society work together.

      Metagovernment is a group of people coming together to discuss
      and work on ideas and technologies for new governance systems
      that will satisfy these desires.  We welcome you to [join us] in
      these efforts.

   Where:

      *bold text is marked thus*

      [join us] is a link to the archive of this discussion list
