<PRE>I'm confused: Which of these &quot;islands&quot; is shown on the Home page?
What happens if these &quot;islands&quot; *don't* grow into consensus?
Gridlock?  Status quo?

Again, the purpose of government is to enable collective
decisionmaking.  Without decisionmaking, there is no government.  Now
that this home page project has clearly shown that this is the case,
can we get back to the business of government by making a decision
about what to put on it?

I didn't do any revisions during the Vilfredo experiment (for fear of
sending it even farther afield), but I'll now volunteer to do one of
my own and will set up a vote on Loomio to get it approved. Look for
it in a day or two.  We'll use the decision rule (simple majority plus
at least 1/3 of registered voters vote yes) that was previously
approved on Loomio because I believe it will work not only on
authoritarians but also on the &quot;consensus&quot; contingent of this group.
Both groups are unreasonable to the point of being irrational and it
will be a good test of the decision rule to see if a decision can be
reached despite these types of disruptive influences.

Mean time, I welcome any debate on the terms &quot;collaboration&quot; and
&quot;consensus&quot;: I've made my position clear many times but have yet to
see a coherent response to my claim that these are simply unreachable
goals for government at any level.
  Regards,
    Scott
