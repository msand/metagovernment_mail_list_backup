<PRE>Hi Marc,

&gt;<i> Does this make sense?
</I>
Yes, I think so.  I wrote it up and probably made some mistakes.
Please check: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/c/WtG">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/c/WtG</A>

   CoP
    |
   SoP
    |     (CoP) Compare the overplans
   ToP    (SoP) Select the best overplan
    |     (ToP) Track discussion of the overplan
   XoP    (XoP) Execute the overplan
    |
   CtD    (CtD) Compare the technical designs
    |     (IdG) Identify the common ground
   IdG    (WtG) Work together on the common ground
    |     (LeG) Leverage the common ground
   WtG
    |
   LeG

Do you want ToP in there?  (See link for details.)  I figure that's
the most doubtful one because we never talked about it specifically.
I'm not 100% sure about *any* of the CoP-XoP steps, so please look
carefully at those.  Are there any you'd remove?  Or add, or re-order?

I'll help with WtG, of course.  And I'll help with the preceding steps
(CtD, IdG) where I reasonably can.  But I'm doubtful we'll get much
help there from other designers.  It's hard to get anyone to take
seriously the idea of cooperation.

Mike

&gt;<i> Mike said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Exactly.  If two technical designs specify the same overplan, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; common ground between them is at least *indicated*.  But whether
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;overplan&quot; belongs in your definition of &quot;common ground&quot;, I can't say.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe it's better to leave it out for now.  So here's our latest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; summary of the way forward, as I think you see it:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Compare the technical designs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      |
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      V
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Identify the common ground.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        * Here &quot;ground&quot; means a design pattern that's employed; or a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          requirement that must be met in order to implement a design;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          or a problem that the design would solve.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      |
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      V
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Focus on the common ground
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I would like to proceed like this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (a) What does &quot;focus&quot; mean here, Marc?  Suppose the previous step has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; identified the common ground between two designs as being (say) a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shared requirement.  Wouldn't both teams of designers *already* be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; focused on that shared requirement?  After all, by definition, their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; designs cannot run without it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think all designers are already focused on *all* their design
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grounds, which includes their *common* design grounds.  Maybe you mean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like &quot;work together&quot; here, instead of &quot;focus&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I mean work together towards or based on this common ground. We might 
</I>&gt;<i> find out a common ground between all designs that is very very generic like 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Make the World a Better Place&quot; or &quot;Improve Online Deliberation&quot;, but we 
</I>&gt;<i> might also have more detailed common ground between just a few of the 
</I>&gt;<i> designs that could also collaborate to join forces in their special area.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point here is, that currently there is less to no cooperation between the 
</I>&gt;<i> designs. IMHO that is wast of resources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (b) Then what?  After the design teams work together (or whatever) on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their common ground, what's the next step forward, if any?  Or is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; next step unknown at this stage, i.e. something to be filled in later?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next step might be to write down our epic story to base some marketing 
</I>&gt;<i> strategy on it to get more attention from the people outside of 
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment. Working together based on the common ground also would give 
</I>&gt;<i> us more power towards potential groups of interests. We would no longer be 
</I>&gt;<i> lone fighters, but we would be a community sharing the same &quot;defined&quot; goals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If we could agree on this [way forward], a next step might be to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; discuss the questionnaire for the survey that we are currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; drafting at AG MFT?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (c) Before agreeing and moving forward in this way, would it make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sense to look at other, alternative ways of moving forward?  Or is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that unnecessary?  Or would it come later?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course. What I outlined here (with your invaluable help) is just a 
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to be discussed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the end my intention is to get more cooperation between the different 
</I>&gt;<i> designs rather than rivalry, because I hope that with more cooperation we 
</I>&gt;<i> could move on much faster. For example, within AG MFT it was a big success 
</I>&gt;<i> to focus on the common ground by defining the least common denominator. 
</I>&gt;<i> After we did this, we had much more progress than before.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this make sense?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> Marc
</I>
