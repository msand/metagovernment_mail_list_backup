<PRE>I notice that when I am being professional I have a hard time telling &quot;I&quot;
stories.  I experience professionalism as not sane.

It can be really hard to reframe an abstract into a personal.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was able to Google on anthropology lpa and get a gloss earlier.  In
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gloss ceptu was a character and a net was a lpa tool for catching animals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; via community cooperation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That story, and several like it, are covered in Boehm's book too.
</I>&gt;<i> Although those groups are very egalitarian and show a remarkable
</I>&gt;<i> degree of compassion and sharing when times are tough they are also
</I>&gt;<i> quite brutal when it comes to dealing with free-riders and other
</I>&gt;<i> problematic individuals.  They'll basically give them a break a few
</I>&gt;<i> times, then either banish them (which drastically reduces that
</I>&gt;<i> individual's chances of survival) or just take a democratic vote and
</I>&gt;<i> then kill them outright (there were no jails or mental hospitals in
</I>&gt;<i> the Pleistocene ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am detached enough recently to look at humans and sit back and wait to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enjoy the ensuing hilarity.   But looking into the kind of mirrors I use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is quite a bit of hilarity there too.  So I will offer you a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; food.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Humans are a strange bunch, to be sure.  But speaking from an
</I>&gt;<i> engineering perspective I've found Evolutionary Psychology to be a
</I>&gt;<i> very useful microscope for examining and  understanding their behavior
</I>&gt;<i> (this after getting a PhD in Cognitive Psychology and having been
</I>&gt;<i> raised in an extended family of psychologists, including both of my
</I>&gt;<i> parents).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; US urban areas have about a 3 day food supply.  In case of a problem the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; local emergency people are not there and it will be three days before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; outside help is available.  If that is not going to arrive in a timely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fashion then your fiat money will not buy food.  And then who will feed
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and why?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I certainly agree that we're a lot closer to the abyss than most
</I>&gt;<i> people believe.  And it won't even have to be anything dramatic like a
</I>&gt;<i> major disruption in the food supply to push us over the edge: Even the
</I>&gt;<i> *threat* of resource shortages can quickly lead to people giving up
</I>&gt;<i> their liberty to a totalitarian leader who promises to provide for
</I>&gt;<i> them.  It's what got Hitler elected as dictator, for example, on a
</I>&gt;<i> platform of increasing &quot;living space&quot;, the invasion of Poland being
</I>&gt;<i> him delivering on that promise.  I still think the best way to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> this would be to replace history with psychology in elementary school
</I>&gt;<i> education (i.e., it doesn't matter what happened, what matters is
</I>&gt;<i> understanding which psychological flaws *cause* things to happen), but
</I>&gt;<i> the next best thing is providing an alternative outlet for their
</I>&gt;<i> tendency to act out of fear. For example in a real direct democracy
</I>&gt;<i> fearmongering is going to be a lot less effective, the result being
</I>&gt;<i> that people will be far more likely to vote to banish or incarcerate
</I>&gt;<i> someone like Hitler than elect him dictator.  And other than that 25%
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian contingent, they simply won't vote to invade Poland
</I>&gt;<i> themselves (as Altemeyer's Global Change Game experiments clearly
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrated).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some food is rotten.
