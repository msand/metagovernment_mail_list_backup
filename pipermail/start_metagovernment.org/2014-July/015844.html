Nice system.  We should definitely run an election on it sometime to
put it through its paces.

I disagree, at least for this particular vote.  Evaluating
proposal-by-proposal is definitely less efficient than being able to
rank order them (something I suggested earlier as a feature for
Vilfredo) but this is the *only* method that is guaranteed to provide
a decision acceptable to the majority.  The problem with rank ordering
is that the top vote getter will be installed even if everyone thinks
it sucks.  Better to be able to just reject the proposal outright, and
modify it or start over if that happens.

&gt;<i> Concerning the irony, I agree, it's delicious.  Reinforcing a past point, I
</I>&gt;<i> think deliberation and decision are separate steps in a process, and we're
</I>&gt;<i> muddling them together.
</I>
Agreed, which is what my system will do: During the creation phase
only the most interested parties will rate and comment on a proposal,
which may be modified to improve it.  During the vote phase, the
previous ratings and comments can be used by the majority of the
population to evaluate the proposal.

So, I request that you and Ned redo your votes: If you object to the
*process* and don't want to legitimize it, change your vote to
&quot;abstain&quot; (since there is no way to &quot;unvote&quot; on Loomio).  If you
object to particular features of my proposal, please follow the
instructions in the proposal and in the announcement letter and vote
&quot;no&quot; and include a comment as to why.  The idea of updating a proposal
while it's being voted on is kind of wiggly, but it's the system I
(and Loomio) defined and you'll just have to trust that I won't pull a
fast one and totally replace the content one second before the vote
closes (and if I do, I'd expect someone to immediately make another
proposal to replace it, which would be an example of cycling or
&quot;flapping&quot;, but that is a superior mode to be operating in than the
current &quot;noop&quot; mode).
  Regards,
    Scott
