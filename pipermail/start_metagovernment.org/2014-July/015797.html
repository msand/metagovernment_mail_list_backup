<PRE>The decision rule is not really in force.  It never went to a vote in
the entire community to begin with.  Only the sub-group of Votorola
users had a vote.  See 'Metaquestion':
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-April/thread.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-April/thread.html</A>
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-May/thread.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-May/thread.html</A>

The reason we currently follow the decision rule is because we have no
other formal rule to follow, *not* because we're forced to follow it.
We follow it freely.

That means we're not forced to obey the supermajority of 80%, either.
When we (all of us, not just Votorola users) decide on a decision
rule, then it'll be our first *binding* decision rule.


I'll back-link to this clarification discussion from:

In proposal, I said:
&gt;<i> I won't report further updates here unless there's a significant
</I>&gt;<i> change in the votes.  It's now almost impossible for this to pass.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    CURRENT VOTES
</I>&gt;<i>    -------------
</I>&gt;<i>        For: Mike, Scott
</I>&gt;<i>    Against: Marc, Ned
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the decision rule really were in force, then we'd have difficulty
</I>&gt;<i> making the slightest change to it.  We'd probably have to throw away
</I>&gt;<i> the wiki first.  The rule would then become meaningless, because it
</I>&gt;<i> applies only to wiki pages: <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we just demonstrated the foolishness of that decision rule.
