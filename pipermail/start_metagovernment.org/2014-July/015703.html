<PRE>We can treat the concept of fixing as a traditional male approach to
treating not-machines that do not function as expected.

I trust that was clear.  I also note that you managed to ignore deep issues
around rationality that perhaps cannot be addressed by you.

Candidly I feel no need to try to be clear about concepts that sit outside
of consensual reality and I thought I was clear enough in my statement to
the effect that I was not going to try.  I gave you some support and gave
you a warning about rationality to think a bit about.

If you want something to do as opposed to think then work with the fellow
who introduced parallalism into the conversation.  You have a rich compiler
design experience laying around to work with and understand and apply.
That area is very difficult but it has a strong axiom basis.

So to tease you.  I am not trying to mitigate the risk that I will not be
in existence in a petrasecond.  And humanity should be trying to mitigate
the risk that it will not be in existence in a petrasecond because?  Please
be clear about this.
