</I>
I actually don't have a problem with that one, it's &quot;consensus&quot; that
causes me to roll my eyes ;-)

Collaboration definitely has a place during the process, especially
early on.  But there are lots of tools that support that and it
doesn't need to be in the main voting/governing system since the
majority of the population won't be collaborating, just voting.

&gt;<i> Maybe when the group increases in size, though it&#8217;s difficult to imagine
</I>&gt;<i> ever turning that determination over to a &quot;special interest group&#8221;.
</I>
My belief is that collaboration isn't necessary or indeed probably
won't even work when you get more than dozen or so actors involved
(though some of those actors may be other special interest groups
composed of multiple individuals).  And that you *have* to assume that
that's the way things will get started because these special interest
groups are where all the energy required to shape a proposal will be
found.

&gt;<i> &gt; I still like my &quot;25% yes votes&quot; quorum rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t understand. How does that work?
</I>
At least 25% of the registered voters have to vote yes.  This weeds
out proposals that a large majority just don't see the need to even
inform themselves on (and so couldn't cast an informed vote on), and
also tactics where a small minority try to get something passed by
deception or other tricks (the example in my book is authoritarians,
who make up roughly 25% of the general population yet are the source
of most of the prejudiced and unethical behavior, doing something like
holding a vote during a holiday or trying to hide something nasty in
an otherwise harmless-looking proposal).

&gt;<i> Grin.  yes.  such pessimism Scott!
</I>&gt;<i> Though to some extent I agree. So much depends on the nature of the group
</I>&gt;<i> (their coherence)...and their willingness to collaborate (or get beyond the
</I>&gt;<i> individual ego).
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve experienced this and it&#8217;s quite empowering. I suspect it&#8217;s a phenomenon
</I>&gt;<i> we are evolving into as a culture&#8230;maybe as a species. I&#8217;m holding the
</I>&gt;<i> optimistic realm.  ;)
</I>
I agree with the evolving part, but we need to help that along by
creating systems that *support* this evolved conception.  As for
whether consensus is a reasonable goal, you've got your food coop,
I've got a list of HOA Board failures a mile long (some of which have
cost me personally a lot of time and money).  HOAs IMHO being a lot
more representative of how the general population behaves than more
specialized organizations.

&gt;<i> Again, if your goal is to preserve that land as open space, allowing
</I>&gt;<i> blocks is a great way to achieve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My thinking is that allowing &#8220;blocks&#8221;...along side the ability of the
</I>&gt;<i> membership to expel someone who uses them irresponsibly should limit their
</I>&gt;<i> abuse.
</I>
Ah, this does open up a whole 'nother range of options.  I'm actually
a big fan of this architecture, and even included the option for
Localities in my book: Some authoritarians in a city/county/state want
to act like ass hats?  Fine, let them do it without the benefit of the
cooperation/funding/infrastructure of the non-ass-hat majority.  I
wish we in the US had this option for Mississippi ;-)

This kind of thing is difficult to structure legally, however,
especially if there are financial interests involved (i.e., you have
to have a well structured way to buy out the offenders, since you
can't just deprive them of the ability to perform their fiduciary duty
to their investments).
  Regards,
    Scott
