<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now think this further. As we have the house &#8216;application&#8217; anyway making
</I>&gt;<i> sure the house is maintained why couldn&#8217;t it do other things as well?
</I>&gt;<i> Technically it&#8217;s not hard to imagine that there may be a sensor that
</I>&gt;<i> notices when a light bulb reached its end of life. Now the improved
</I>&gt;<i> House-OS could check online what a new light bulb cost and hire a
</I>&gt;<i> contractor to exchange it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I think of &quot;DAO&quot; (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation)
The second thing I think of falls under &quot;Home Automation&quot; or &quot;Smart Homes&quot;
... and of course, those &quot;devices&quot; can have &quot;rights&quot; in an &quot;ethereum
contract&quot; and &quot;trigger&quot; some &quot;contract behavior&quot;, right?




Nobody would noticed that the light bulb went out except the House-OS, in
&gt;<i> real time. It can simply query 2000 houses in the neighborhood and find out
</I>&gt;<i> what the most efficient course of action would be to fix it. Once done, it
</I>&gt;<i> pays the contractor with a little allowance of Bitcoin that it keeps in
</I>&gt;<i> escrow and notifies it&#8217;s inhabitant about the expense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Yes, but this is now a whole emerging industry you are talking of.



Think even further, light is energy, it&#8217;s already easily measured. The
&gt;<i> house could read the meter. What would be the trouble to find out how
</I>&gt;<i> inhabitants made use of the light bulb? Their smartphone would indicate
</I>&gt;<i> their presence in the room and so the bill would be split accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe one particular person used the lamp 80% of the time to study and so
</I>&gt;<i> others wouldn&#8217;t have to pay for something they didn&#8217;t use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, this could also be used by services like &quot;Airbnb&quot;




&gt;<i> Thinking this even further drives also the message home that this couldn&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> be done by some central authority because trust would have to be proxied to
</I>&gt;<i> so many people that hardly anybody would want to life in an iHouse made by
</I>&gt;<i> Apple. The implications would be too severe. Not even to mention the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that you&#8217;d have the NSA as flat mate as well. But on a blockchain it&#8217;d be
</I>&gt;<i> trustless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Different people, different philosophies...
...but even if you do not go for &quot;home automation&quot;, but just use the
&quot;voting&quot; and &quot;ethereum contracts&quot; and &quot;bitcoins&quot; and build a DAO that fits
your personal taste might be nice enough. You could use it for whatever
without connecting any kind of &quot;home automation stuff&quot; to it.





&gt;<i> No authority could interfere. There is only you. Your house stays your
</I>&gt;<i> castle. It doesn&#8217;t need to push advertisements into your living room or try
</I>&gt;<i> to up-sell you because it adheres only to the open source algorithm that
</I>&gt;<i> life&#8217;s on the blockchain and no corporate finance scheme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
whatever you like :-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could be even abstracted further, to bring up another example, a guy
</I>&gt;<i> at google proposed a self-driving car that could own itself!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129553.700-bitcoin-how-its-core-technology-will-change-the-world.html#null">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129553.700-bitcoin-how-its-core-technology-will-change-the-world.html#null</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

A car that could own itself is thinkable, but not very likely, because
there will probably always be an owner.
Why would anyone release a car into the wild and not get any profit from
it???
Maybe in the future those &quot;self organized cars&quot; which go and earn money for
their owners and take care of themselves might exist, but that will be very
far in the future. :-)






And it goes further! The car is just a smart property and the algorithm
&gt;<i> could just be some &#8220;Mobility&#8221; or &#8220;Transportation&#8221; App that runs on your
</I>&gt;<i> Personal Operating System. It would just organize a way of transportation
</I>&gt;<i> according to your priorities of speed, price or comfort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only think about trust and all of a sudden it becomes clear how
</I>&gt;<i> Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are better stewards then
</I>&gt;<i> centralized organizations driven by agency, human self-interest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you wonder what all of that has to do with voting and liquid democracy?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

To me it is clear, that for me is a nice bottom-up-approach, but the &quot;home
automation&quot; or &quot;smart homes&quot; and whether or not &quot;cars which own themselves&quot;
will exist or not, is not related to it. Especially the last thing is
something, that for some reasons might happen or maybe it wont. BUT:
Even if you put aside the science fiction story of &quot;self owned smart
homes&quot;, then your story comes much closer to &quot;tomorrow&quot; than the story that
includes all this smart home stuff...




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *2. How would it look like?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me bring up another example that may hit closer to home. Let me
</I>&gt;<i> introduce you to Johanna Doe. Let her life in the previous mentioned house
</I>&gt;<i> and assume that she is mid-aged, tired of her 9 to 5 job and eager to
</I>&gt;<i> fulfill her life dream of opening a restaurant. She is a gifted chef and
</I>&gt;<i> all her friends know it, but she has been working as a Consultant and has
</I>&gt;<i> also 2 dependable children which force her to stay put. She couldn&#8217;t take
</I>&gt;<i> any risk, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course under current conditions she could go to a bank, mortgage off
</I>&gt;<i> her few belongings and her kids&#8217; future and give it a try. Never mind that
</I>&gt;<i> she couldn&#8217;t return to the the save job she has and her future would be
</I>&gt;<i> shattered if that didn&#8217;t work out. - Clearly, she wouldn&#8217;t take the risk to
</I>&gt;<i> open the restaurant today.
</I>&gt;<i> But after implementing the blockchain technology at home she figures that
</I>&gt;<i> with it she doesn&#8217;t need a bank! She can just run her own IPO and limit her
</I>&gt;<i> exposure by substituting it with the trust that all her friends put into
</I>&gt;<i> her.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

... or just bootstrap it slowly :-) ...there is zillions of ways to get
something started.



Instead, she puts up 25k of her savings as upfront investment and uses
&gt;<i> another blockchain-contract on the trustless layer to issue a new token.
</I>&gt;<i> It&#8217;s Johana&#8217;s Restaurant-Share-Token and she issues 100 of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> She can only back it with 25k but she needs 250k to get off the ground.
</I>&gt;<i> Under current conditions &#8216;investing&#8217; in her would be a crazy complicated
</I>&gt;<i> task because it would involve so many layers of trust like lawyers working
</I>&gt;<i> out agreements, banks, rating agencies, accountants and all the government
</I>&gt;<i> regulation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Yes, thats what this crypto technology does. it cuts out the middlemen and
opens new ways of doing things, but this kind of stuff happens to lots of
things. Building a business these days is more like creating a &quot;mashup&quot; of
existing products and services and i dont think any upfront investments are
necessary anymore.
At least they are way less than in the past and this trend will continue...
...so maybe the problem u describe above is more or less imaginary :-)




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the blockchain she can simply issue the token and give the trustless
</I>&gt;<i> application the ability to distribute her initial investment equally to
</I>&gt;<i> everybody who bought a token in the event of insolvency. She can also
</I>&gt;<i> attach the business to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not only that is possible but Johanna is smart so she also tabs into a
</I>&gt;<i> broader market. She issues a second token that allows its owners to have a
</I>&gt;<i> dinner of their choice + a drink. She structures the trustless contract so
</I>&gt;<i> that these token are valid for 3 years after the official opening. Here we
</I>&gt;<i> witness the birth of Johana&#8217;s Restaurant-EAT-Token.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of that is super frictionless and basically just requires the exchange
</I>&gt;<i> of 2 hash codes for anybody to join in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to raise awareness she starts organizing dinner parties and
</I>&gt;<i> advertises it to friends, family her community and also some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> Kickstarter online.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It&#8217;s easy to see that for example Herbert who just attends one of her
</I>&gt;<i> dinner parties and is enchanted by the delicious feast just procures with a
</I>&gt;<i> tap on his smartphone 25 Restaurant-Eat-Tokens for 250 and also one
</I>&gt;<i> Restaurant-Share-Token.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No 3rd party is involved, he can trust everything because the
</I>&gt;<i> Contract-Applications are open source, peer reviewed and operate on a
</I>&gt;<i> trustless layer. Nobody can interfere with it, neither Johana nor any
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary trust-monopolist who would like to coherence a profit out of
</I>&gt;<i> either party.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Does somebody PAY you for advertising? :-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now Herbert&#8217;s ledger would look like below:
</I>&gt;<i> 25 Restaurant-Eat-Tokens -&gt; He paid 250
</I>&gt;<i> // The value of a future menu is estimated to be 20; implied value = 500
</I>&gt;<i> 1 Restaurant-Share-Token -&gt; He paid 250k/100= 2.5k
</I>&gt;<i> // 2.5k is the initial value but Johana has provided only 25k/100=250 as
</I>&gt;<i> collateral
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; In addition he assumes the liquidation value of the enterprise if it
</I>&gt;<i> fails would be at least 100k (average for Restaurants).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> His value at Risk is 2500-250(Collateral)-1000(Liquidation value)= 1250,
</I>&gt;<i> this is additionally offset with the spread between cost and price of
</I>&gt;<i> Restaurant-Eat-Tokens of 250.
</I>&gt;<i> Final value at risk: 1000.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - He believes that Johanna is a great chef and even if he lost 1000 he is
</I>&gt;<i> really proud of supporting this endeavor (important he is not an anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> shareholder!)
</I>&gt;<i> And if it succeeds, his investment may even pay out handsomely. He is part
</I>&gt;<i> of the story because he will bring his friends to the place and spent his
</I>&gt;<i> Restaurant-Eat-Tokens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously due to the frictionless, secure and easy to use of the
</I>&gt;<i> blockchain implementation Johanna manages to sell 50 Restaurant-Share-Token
</I>&gt;<i> for 125k and another 2500 Restaurant-Eat-Tokens because all her friends on
</I>&gt;<i> the trustless implementation of a social-network just buy some like they
</I>&gt;<i> would have done with a click on &#8220;like&#8221; in the old days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, after the money is raised and she got the lease for the place
</I>&gt;<i> she can quit her job and get going. Important: No interest payments, no
</I>&gt;<i> debt service, no mortgage, no hassle!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Meet Maria, a smart venture capitalist with special taste-buds notices
</I>&gt;<i> Johanna&#8217;s potential and buys on the open market 25 Restaurant-SHARE-Token
</I>&gt;<i> for 500k because she sees an opportunity to bring her expertise into the
</I>&gt;<i> business and create a franchises later on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One Restaurant-SHARE-Token is now valued at 10k (2.5k at issuance). The
</I>&gt;<i> total business is now valued at 1Mio.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

You are definitely advertising :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I can't seem to find it, can you provide a link?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There's been some initial talk in the Metagov list.  That's where I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first posted about the idea of comparing these step-wise plans.  That
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was just before I posted it to you, Martin.  Here's the thread:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-June/006807.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-June/006807.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (so I cc them, also because I moot the idea of using their wiki)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The basic idea of comparing overplans (if that's a good name for them)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is itself a kind of overplan.  I drafted it up and posted it to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Metagov wiki: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's mostly what the above thread is about.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ... I think my [specific] proposal and also yours Mike is in essence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; really a bit away from the other approaches ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also wrote up a full, specific overplan (my own), which shows what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one might look like: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's a lot more than the single step (DvI) that I first suggested to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you, Martin.  If anyone wants to discuss it, then it would probably be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a topic for a separate thread.  Here I hope we can talk about the much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simpler, basic idea of &quot;one step at a time&quot; (as Martin puts it), and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the idea of comparing the various step-wise plans that would emerge.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ... and during many recent Brunch and Lunch discussions I found that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it is really hard to drive the idea of trustless architecture
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; home. Never mind opinion aggregation, as far as I understood it, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it is less applicable outside of a narrow scope.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Driving ideas...  I've been involved in attempts to drive the idea of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something or other into someone or other in this field for 7 years
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with little to show for it.  We made progress as a small team.  We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spawned several good inventions in tight discussions by Skype or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> email.  But we never made much progress communicating with rival
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> teams, or with a general audience, or uncommitted individuals (as in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lists), despite huge efforts.  Often the idea we wanted to communicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was nothing but, &quot;Hey, let's cooperate on something (anything) at a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minimal level, and mature this field a little.&quot; *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So... One thing to like about this approach of comparing overplans (or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whatever we call them) is it seems to be unstoppable.  We don't really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to convince anyone of the approach up front, or even explain it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (though probably we should try).  Instead it'll be enough to start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing it.  Others will get sucked in willee nillee, because there's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just no reasonable alternative.  Or am I wrong?  Is there a reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative to the steps below?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    CoP    Compare the overplans (or whatever we call them)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    SoP    Select the best overplan
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    ToP    Track discussion of the overplan
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    XoP    Execute the overplan
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another thing to like about this approach is that you can never get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seriously stuck or lost.  You just keep following the steps of your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chosen overplan.  At worst, you'll have to cycle back to earlier steps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (like SoP) more often than you hoped.  But eventually you'll succeed,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guaranteed.  Or again, am I wrong?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * One exception is Metagov where we hammered away for over 5 years.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    They were always a very open, democratic community, but now they're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    a neutral one, too.  They take no sides.  (I imagine that's partly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    because of Thomas and me, and our efforts there.)  So I figure the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Metagov wiki is a good place to start posting overplans.
