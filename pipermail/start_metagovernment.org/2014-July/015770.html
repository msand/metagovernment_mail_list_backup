&gt;<i> Interesting position, Ned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have two questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) How would you make sure that the people participating do not forget 
</I>&gt;<i> a question?
</I>
Each question has its own context. In this case, what makes sure that 
this particular question will not be forgotten is that the Home Page is 
still blank.

&gt;<i> Do you think Ed will remember this in a fortnight?
</I>
I think that Ed will (still) prefer in a fortnight that the Home Page 
have actual content, and will (still) prefer that the content be 
determined through the process of collaborative synthesis (that Vilfredo 
excels at facilitating).

&gt;<i> Should Vilfredo send them weekly reminders?
</I>
For this particular question, I think that the best sort of &quot;reminder 
method&quot; is what just happened: Mike made inquiry, and now everyone 
monitoring the list is aware that Proposal 2 is &quot;still kicking&quot; on Vilfredo.
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164</A>

And also, I think that neither Vilfredo nor any other software system 
can do the thinking and the writing of synthesis for us. We still need 
to sit down and think, and write. (Voting and writing are two entirely 
different things.)

&gt;<i> How could this be done without it becoming a spam abuse?
</I>
Though there may be exceptions, in general I don't think that Vilfredo 
should &quot;remind&quot;. The actual motivations for most questions are extrinsic 
to the Vilfredo process (as is the case with the Home Page). People will 
work when they have time, and are otherwise motivated to do so.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Obviously you understand that not every question will always have a 
</I>&gt;<i> consensual answer on which everybody agrees.
</I>
I do. And in that case, a win would be to have a clear understanding of 
exactly what the irreconcilable differences are.

In the case of Proposal 2, we have two different introductions at odds 
(2712 vs. 2753), and we have &quot;introduction only&quot; at odds with 
&quot;introduction plus&quot;. (Neither of those differences seem terminal to me 
-- we'll see ...)

&gt;<i> Sometimes Vilfredo's work is successful in finding the set of best 
</I>&gt;<i> candidates representing the participants.
</I>
In this case, I don't think that we are there yet. We need some more 
proposals that attempt synthesis, and that go beyond the comfortable 
safety of the introduction and &quot;jump into metagovernment&quot;: discussing 
what we are and what we do.

&gt;<i> In Vilfredo2.0 Vilfredo will take the hint that no one has anything to 
</I>&gt;<i> add, to take all the information it has gathered so far, and use it to 
</I>&gt;<i> provide a final ordering.
</I>
When the Forces of Mordor are attacking the Northern Frontier, the 
decision system cannot afford to dither around. But the question of what 
should go on the Home Page is not seated in that sort of context.

In fact, the context is arguably of an opposite type: through the 
process of reaching agreement on the Home Page content, we reach 
agreement regarding what sort of group we are, and what our work is. The 
specific question serves a broader end.

We have recently had two (to me) really great articles posted to the list:
The Valve Cabal:
<A HREF="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131815/the_cabal_valves_design_process_.php">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131815/the_cabal_valves_design_process_.php</A>
Disputation Arenas:
<A HREF="http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html">http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html</A>

To me, it seems that Metagovernment has in fact become a very general 
&quot;disputation arena&quot; for the e-democracy field, mainly because the term 
&quot;metagovernment&quot; is so darned expansive. (If the group were named 
&quot;community voting systems&quot;, it would not have been nearly so effective 
at attracting people looking to test their outlandish ideas through 
far-ranging discourse with peers.) And, I see that as a Very Good Thing.

The Home Page is where we own that reality, or not. (Disputation Arena, 
or not?)

And also, the process through which we decide the Home Page question is 
where we &quot;walk our talk&quot;, or not. (Valve-Cabal, or not? Consensus 
through Synthesis, or not?)

&gt;<i> But it looks like you probably would not like this solution.
</I>
In some cases: yes, in other cases: no. Specifically with respect to the 
Home Page question, definitely not. I would see it as wasting the 
valuable opportunity that blanking the Home Page has created.

&gt;<i> How would you rather see the questions end up?
</I>
Each question has its own context. One size does not fit all.

&gt;<i> How should Vilfredo distinguish when the community just is sleeping, 
</I>&gt;<i> and when the search has ended?
</I>
I don't think that there is an algorithmic way to make that distinction. 
In each case, we will need to look and see.

In this particular case, my view is that the community is not sleeping, 
and that the search has not ended, and that we are going to need to 
&quot;step up our game&quot; to resolve the matter. Maybe we will, maybe not.
