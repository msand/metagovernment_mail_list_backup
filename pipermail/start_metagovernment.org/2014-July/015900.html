&gt;<i> Hi Scott,

</I>
Agreed, although part of that was just impedance mismatch (the tool
didn't facilitate going the route the users apparently wanted to
take).

&gt;<i> The proposal was turned down, but we kept on using Vilfredo with the hope
</I>&gt;<i> that it would bring us to a consensus. Vilfredo does not always reach a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus (as Condorcet, by the way. Some Condorcet system do, but not all
</I>&gt;<i> of them), but please do not accuse Vilfredo for the result. It is a tool,
</I>&gt;<i> you need to know how to use it. And if you do not reach a consensus you need
</I>&gt;<i> to know beforehand what will you do.
</I>
Agreed, although I predict that &quot;not reaching consensus&quot; is going to
be the most common outcome and so the tool itself should provide
choices for that final step.

&gt;<i> Yes, in this group we all share the dream of building some tool that permit
</I>&gt;<i> a democratic discussion. So the merging of discussions and voting. You might
</I>&gt;<i> not share this dream. Fine. But do not protest if we do not feel like
</I>&gt;<i> following you into applying just a simple majority voting. Why would we be
</I>&gt;<i> voting for this proposal on Loomio instead than another? Who writes the
</I>&gt;<i> option to vote have a lot of power. You have not addressed that, and instead
</I>&gt;<i> insist that people here would vote for metamerman proposal.
</I>
Hence the &quot;herding cats&quot; metaphor, and my frequent observation that
you all are more interested in process than in results.  I don't
object to using any other tool than Loomio, I disagree with the
philosophy that it is impossible to make a valid and binding decision
without having everyone put their 2 cents in during the proposal
development phase.  It's simply an impractical position to take,
clearly demonstrated by this failure with a small group of
(supposedly) like-minded individuals.  With thousands or millions of
voters, it's a completely ridiculous position to take.  I've seen the
same thing happen in every attempt to use Google Docs to generate
policy documents that I've been involved with and the failure mode is
the same: A few persistent individuals end up getting their way
because everyone else either burns out or simply refuses to
participate.  Wikipedia (and most Wikis) face the same problem, but
the problem there is usually much more manageable merely because there
is at least theoretically a &quot;truth&quot; that everyone is supposedly
working toward.  There is no such underlying truth in government-level
decisionmaking.

Which is why my philosophy (and my system) is based on simply having
the interested party or parties write the proposal and the voters then
just give it an up or down vote.  There is no &quot;bias&quot; with this system
as you claim so long as no limits are placed on revisiting a decision.
If you don't like my proposal after it succeeds, make another proposal
to replace it!  Flapping like this, again, is surely inefficient but
not anywhere near as bad as simply failing to make a decision at all.
The latter being the &quot;decision&quot; that you (and Ed, and others) are
imposing on the rest of us (i.e., it's a &quot;tyranny of the minority&quot;).

&gt;<i> I think the really good decision is:
</I>&gt;<i> we all suggest a decision system, we then vote using an ordered ballot and
</I>&gt;<i> counting using a Condorcet system, and then we do what we have voted.
</I>
And I'm sure this is a waste of time because:
a) We really don't have any viable options other than Loomio for even
making the final decision.  It would be helpful to have another tool
to prioritize the individual bullet items (which is a
resource-allocation or redistribution issue, more like approving a
budget than voting for a representative), but, again, that's an
optimization that we don't really need so long as people are willing
to put their cards on the table and *STATE* what they want (something
I've repeatedly asked for yet which I notice was conspicuously missing
from your reply).

b) You're all deluded if you think any options would result in
significantly different outcomes in the final voting, at least for the
Home Page content.  The problems we're facing just aren't the kinds of
problems Condorcet or Borda are even designed to address.  I'm
assuming none of you are interested in voting on a slate of
*representatives*, right? If that's the case, we don't even need to
consider those fancy systems because in the end there *will* only be
one decision to make (approve a proposal or not).  In that case, a
simple majority decision rule *is* the only appropriate possibility.

&gt;<i> You want to use Loomio, suggest that. I want to use Vilfredo in a specific
</I>&gt;<i> way? I will suggest that. Ned wants to use Vilfredo in another way. Fine.
</I>&gt;<i> Jacopo will suggest Airesis. And Michal will suggest his groups and or a
</I>&gt;<i> delphi system.
</I>
Right, herding cats.

&gt;<i> It seemed to me that we were slowly achieving a consensus on this idea,
</I>&gt;<i> which is why I will right now vote against any other process that will try
</I>&gt;<i> to shortcut this. So I voted No both on Loomio and to Michael groups.
</I>
Hey, it's already been two months now, and if you think we're any
closer to a decision here (on the Home Page or even on the decision
rule), you're not seeing the same process I am.
  Regards,
    Scott
