<PRE>Thanks for including the AmericanQuorum ranked choice straw poll project in your list. My request is that you reframe its listing as the Indaba Application Network (indaba.org). That is the overarching&#160;container for AmericanQuorum and several related projects, including Sygnol, ChoiceRanker, and WeVote.

Hi Mike,

That is a very good idea!

In the following I would like to refer to current approaches regarding your 
list (<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/soc/des-22">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/soc/des-22</A>) as &quot;designs&quot;.

We at AG MFT currently prepare a questionnaire to follow up with a survey 
where any of this designs could give their feedback in a quite structured 
form.

For this purpose we are customizing an existing tool called &quot;PM Delta&quot; to 
contain our specific set of questions. This tool is able to analyse the 
survey and provide some sophisticated reports.

To be honest, til now we just thought about rough categorizations of the 
designs, but maybe we could enhance this with a structure that makes it 
easier to compare the different overplans? But for the beginning we think it 
might be easier to give specific categories to choose from.

Maybe we could proceed as following:

(1) AG MFT is close to finish a first draft of the questionary for the 
survey.

(2) As soon as we have completed our proposal, we are going to put it for 
discussion on the metagov list. Here we could shape the categories and 
questions together.

(3) After gaining a specific degree of agreement, we try to get as many 
designs as possible to participate.

(4) Then we analyse this with PM Delta. The outcome of the analysis should 
be a better understanding of how the different designs are related to each 
other. How big or small the common ground is, to build upon. What are the 
aspects that separate and connect us.

(5) Then we focus on the things that connect us rather than separate us!

What do you think?

Cheers
Marc

Here's a list of 77 technical designs for participatory democracy.
These are all of the novel (or radical) practices, techniques, tools,
systems and other facilities that we know of (please add any that are
missing): <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/soc/des-22">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/soc/des-22</A>

I was thinking we could ask each of the designers, &quot;By what steps
could your design advance the field of participatory democracy, or
otherwise achieve an outcome that is beneficial to humanity?&quot;&#160; We
could record the answers (the steps they foresee) and then get a feel
for the different possibilities of moving forward.

That's just one idea.&#160; I don't mean we should necessarily jump in and
do that right now.&#160; I'm more interested in what others think.
