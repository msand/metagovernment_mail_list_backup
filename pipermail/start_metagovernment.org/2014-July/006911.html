Alex replied:
&gt;<i> ok, still confusing what exactly a &quot;selective overplan&quot; should be...
</I>
A selective overplan (to answer) is one with *at least* this sequence
of four steps: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP</A>

   CoP    Compare the overplans
    |
   SoP    Select the best overplan
    |
   ToP    Track discussion of the overplan
    |
   XoP    Execute the overplan
    .                               
    .

I think probably every rational overplan is a selective overplan (has
this sequence of steps).  Therefore it is never top-down in the sense
of being imposed by force, but always bottom-up in the sense of being
written and chosen (SoP) by individuals at the grass roots.

We currently have just three overplans in our catalogue to choose from
and all are selective: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d</A>

Only one (NxRO) is actually executable, however, because the other two
are only abstract (they have holes, or &quot;hotspots&quot;).

I'll try to discover and catalogue some more executable overplans
soon.  Then we (each of us) will be able to start making a rational
choice of how to proceed; i.e. selecting which overplan to execute.
