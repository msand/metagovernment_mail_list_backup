<PRE>Hi Martin,
i stumbled upon ethereum and maidsafe a while ago and posted it already to
the mailinglist.
The idea behind ethereum i like a lot, even though it doesnt have to be
&quot;ethereum&quot;, but something similar.
The idea behind maidsafe is yet a bit blurry to me, but it catched my
attention. can you explain and tell me the differences?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

i have, but i lack some knowledge about &quot;Maidsafe&quot; :-)
i read a bit about it, but it's hard for me to grasp what its really
about...



*1. The basics*
&gt;<i> I came across the hippy commune house management software, it&#8217;s basically
</I>&gt;<i> a perfect starting ground. Think of the commune as people who have to trust
</I>&gt;<i> each other to fulfill certain tasks. In essence the house may need 10h of
</I>&gt;<i> attention every week, cleaning, taking the garbage out, sweeping the porch,
</I>&gt;<i> washing the dishes etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Everybody who had flat mates knows this problem and it gets more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated as more people live together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

It sounds to me like something that could be achieved with a &quot;ethereum
contract&quot;.



A trustless implementation would be that we issue a token that represents
&gt;<i> 1h of community work. They are created on a linear curve, say every week 10
</I>&gt;<i> token. The number of token issued may raise or fall with the number of
</I>&gt;<i> people currently occupying the building.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everybody gets a token and the idea is to get rid of them because they
</I>&gt;<i> present the obligation to do something. If you have too many token it&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> obvious that you are the lazy bum. Think of it like a bitcoin that is
</I>&gt;<i> returned to the wallet of the &#8216;house&#8217;. The &#8216;house&#8217; is an autonomous agent,
</I>&gt;<i> let&#8217;s say a fork of Bitcoin with a few tweaks. It can easily life on
</I>&gt;<i> Ethereum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>



*I'm not sure if i can follow your proposed mechanics, but maybe the house
can be an &quot;ethereum contract&quot; and members can be invited to the &quot;house
contract&quot; or not. Every month, a membership fee of &quot;x&quot; is required and you
just display how may of your &quot;negative coins&quot; people have, that means, how
much hours they &quot;owe&quot;... if everyone did their job, the contract pays out
those 10 bitcoins to them.So all that is required to get started is to give
every member 10 BITCOINS, which will be recycled forever if everyone does
his job.If some new member doesnt have 10 BITCOINS, just use a &quot;Bitcoin
Exchange&quot; and order him 10 Bitcoins which he pays for with EUR or USD or
whatever...*




A simple implementation would for example mean that we have a trigger in
&gt;<i> order to acknowledge a token as spent. For that 2 people would have to
</I>&gt;<i> confirm that a 3rd person has attended to a certain task. Like cleaning the
</I>&gt;<i> bathroom and the transaction of on House-Token from this person back to
</I>&gt;<i> house wallet is confirmed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

You can do that in the &quot;ethereum contract&quot;, that means, u can members give
&quot;rights&quot; to agree/vote/whatever on something, to trigger the execution of
some payments according to the contract mechanics...
In &quot;theory&quot;, you could make &quot;sensors&quot; (like webcams, or measuring dust in
the air or the &quot;smell of soap&quot; ...or whatever) members of the contract and
they say yes/no and execute the contract, but that would also mean, people
could start to &quot;game&quot; those sensors, which you might not want. ...but maybe
you can do some sort of combination between sensor and people... who knows
:<i>-)
</I>



&gt;<i> For that, a person proposes to do a certain task and if accomplished 2
</I>&gt;<i> others acknowledge it and one token is spent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that each of the 10 people in the house is presented with the
</I>&gt;<i> challenge to find a task every week to get his balance to 0. If one person
</I>&gt;<i> doesn&#8217;t do something for a while he would obviously accumulate a number of
</I>&gt;<i> token. As such, pressure mounts to contribute. It makes maintaining the
</I>&gt;<i> house very orderly and straight forward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Outside of the house there would be no purpose for this specific
</I>&gt;<i> house-token (currency?) but for the inhabitants it&#8217;s an important metric.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of that could be created for example with a &#8216;contract&#8217; on Ethereum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

yes, it could and u could use bitcoin, or some whatever coin probably...
...but would also be interesting to use &quot;real bitcoins&quot; :-)
