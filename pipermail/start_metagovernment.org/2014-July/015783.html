I've played Half-life.  Vilfredo is nothing like Half-life ;-)  The
main difference is that even when you die in HL and have to replay a
section, you can have complete confidence that there *is* a way
through the trouble spot.  My feeling with Vilfredo, at least for
open-ended decisions like this Home Page, is that the morass just
grows and grows.  I'm not tired, I just refuse to waste any more time
on a process that clearly is not working.

&gt;<i> A key part of Valve's design process involves intentionally
</I>&gt;<i> studying individual people who are actually playing the game. Rather than
</I>&gt;<i> make superficial over-generalized guesses, we need to be actually,
</I>&gt;<i> empirically study when and why individual people participate in the Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> process. (I know that Pietro does this. Various others are content to simply
</I>&gt;<i> believe their own unexamined, untested opinions.)
</I>
This experience has not been a complete waste of time, as I'm sure
Pietro and all of us have learned a lot about this type of system.
But what I mostly learned is that the domain should be very restricted
for Vilfredo to be a useful tool.  Perhaps we could try it again with
the decision-rule question ;-)

&gt;<i> Since I don't have time right now to fully participate, I will have to just
</I>&gt;<i> watch in horror any attempt to short-circuit and go around the Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> process. But it will be OK, the world will (probably) not end due to that
</I>&gt;<i> short-circuiting, and we can always blank the Home Page again later. (Remind
</I>&gt;<i> me why we think that the world will end if the Home Page remains blanked a
</I>&gt;<i> while longer?)
</I>
It's coming up on two months now, and IMHO we have lost a lot of
credibility as an &quot;organization&quot; because if we can't even govern
ourselves, what hope do we have of being instrumental in the
production of a system that would allow others to do so?  You all seem
to be perfectly comfortable allowing decisions to take months, as long
as they're the &quot;right&quot; decisions, and that no decision is better than
a &quot;wrong&quot; decision.  But I submit that you are living in a fantasy
world because the real world doesn't work this way.  As I said in my
first post to this list, it's time to put up or shut up: 6 years
without a viable decision-making system (or even a debate/vote on a
decision rule) is long enough to conclusively determine that whatever
you're doing isn't working.  You're occupying valuable real estate and
mind share and it's time to either make use of it, or admit that your
approach had serious flaws and then change it.
  Regards,
    Scott
