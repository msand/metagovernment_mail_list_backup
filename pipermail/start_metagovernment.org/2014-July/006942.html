<PRE>And you, Henri?  Maybe you can answer our question.  By what steps do
you hope to advance the field of participatory democracy, or otherwise
achieve an outcome that is beneficial to humanity?

Henri Nathanson said to Marc in the AG Meinungsfindungstool list:
&gt;<i> Oh lol.
</I>&gt;<i> You are so pathetic. Do you expect to find democracy by building a common
</I>&gt;<i> ground for that list of bullshit? Really?? Haha. This is so very funny.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry guys, but you cannot exchange reasoning with anything you are doing
</I>&gt;<i> here. Not as you claim to go for participatory or whatever you silly name
</I>&gt;<i> democracy. The latter sits right on my very lap so beautifully. And you
</I>&gt;<i> wont get anything from her besides what you get from me. I put her up for
</I>&gt;<i> you here in pirate world. But you brilliantly brightly did not even get a
</I>&gt;<i> glimpse as you are so busy digging in mud. I am really wondering how long
</I>&gt;<i> you will go on with your kids mud games? It took me ten years to understand
</I>&gt;<i> democracy. You will likely not get it in a much longer period of time. And
</I>&gt;<i> for the case you envy me. I dont really care. If you dont share. My
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of democracy. As I stay king as long as you dont dare.
</I>&gt;<i> Gute Nacht&gt; 
</I>

Michael Allan said in the Metagovernment list:
&gt;<i> Scott suggests that we should start small, and Alex agrees.  So maybe
</I>&gt;<i> we should start by experimenting on ourselves.  Here's all the people
</I>&gt;<i> (28) who have posted to the mailing list in the last 6 months:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Allan, Michael
</I>&gt;<i>     Coffman, Steve
</I>&gt;<i>     Conner, Ned
</I>&gt;<i>     Davis, Bentley
</I>&gt;<i>     Driver, Phil
</I>&gt;<i>     Eaton, Roger
</I>&gt;<i>     Elvira, Eduardo Robles
</I>&gt;<i>     Fenizio, Pietro Speroni di
</I>&gt;<i>     Franks, Richard
</I>&gt;<i>     Frischmuth, Mark
</I>&gt;<i>     Giza, Mark
</I>&gt;<i>     Hancock, James
</I>&gt;<i>     Hinke, Oliver
</I>&gt;<i>     Malina, Will
</I>&gt;<i>     Menezes, Gustavo
</I>&gt;<i>     Millerd, Reid
</I>&gt;<i>     Nollen, Paul
</I>&gt;<i>     Owen, Jo
</I>&gt;<i>     Pastore, Ed
</I>&gt;<i>     Pilling, Michael
</I>&gt;<i>     Piwecki, Marc
</I>&gt;<i>     Praetorius, Alexander
</I>&gt;<i>     Raney, Scott
</I>&gt;<i>     Reichert, Paul
</I>&gt;<i>     Simon, Craig
</I>&gt;<i>     Stalnaker, Max
</I>&gt;<i>     Stottle, Harry
</I>&gt;<i>     Tolja, Jacopo
</I>&gt;<i>     Yaron, Tal
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose we ask each, &quot;By what steps do you hope to advance democracy
</I>&gt;<i> or otherwise achieve a beneficial outcome?&quot; - and record the answers:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/soc/person-22">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/soc/person-22</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a tough technique.  Looking at it, there's probably no way it
</I>&gt;<i> could fail to move things forward.  I think the most likely outcome is
</I>&gt;<i> that everyone agrees on the first few steps without difficulty, and we
</I>&gt;<i> move forward by taking them.  No matter what the outcome, however,
</I>&gt;<i> it's hard to see how it could fail to give us useful information on
</I>&gt;<i> the question of moving forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So we could try this.  Or does anyone have an alternative suggestion?
</I>
