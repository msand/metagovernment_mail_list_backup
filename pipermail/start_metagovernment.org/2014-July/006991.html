<PRE>I propose we elect a moderator to help us keep our discussions polite.
We shouldn't allow instances of taunting, baiting, or other personal
abuse to go unchecked.  Otherwise we'll have trouble attracting good
members, or holding onto the ones we have.

   PROPOSAL 7
   ----------
   (a) Create the elected office of Moderator.

   (b) The Moderator has the privledges of &quot;list moderator&quot;.
       <A HREF="http://wiki.list.org/display/DOC/Difference+Between+a+Moderator+and+Administrator">http://wiki.list.org/display/DOC/Difference+Between+a+Moderator+and+Administrator</A>

   (c) The Moderator may ask the list administrator to set or clear
       the moderation flag for any particular email address.  This is
       the flag that controls whether or not new posts are to be held
       for review by the Moderator.  The administrator will normally
       comply with such moderation requests, but may refuse under
       either of the following conditions:

          i) a proposal to force a new election is in progress (f); or
         ii) a new election is already in progress.

   (d) The election method for the Moderator will be decided
       separately by applying the decision rule with T = plurality,
       and W = 3 weeks:
       <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules?oldid=3545">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules?oldid=3545</A>

   (e) In deciding the election method (d), each voter will name his
       or her preferred method.  There are no restrictions on what
       methods may be voted for.  For example:

         * I vote we use majority judgment to elect the Moderator.
         * I vote we use plurality.
         * I vote we use range voting.

       Voters may of course change their minds before the decision
       becomes final.  The decision becomes final when a single method
       has maintained a plurality of votes for 3 weeks.

   (f) A new election may be forced at any time by a general community
       decision, which by convention (at time of writing) is T = 66%,
       W = 1 week: <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules?oldid=3545">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules?oldid=3545</A>

   (g) A new election may be called by anyone if one of the following
       conditions is currently met:

           i) the Moderator has resigned; or
          ii) the Moderator is incapacitated; or
         iii) six months have passed since the last election.


   CURRENT VOTES
   -------------
       For: Mike
   Against: (nobody)


I hope we don't need to moderate anyone.  There were several posts in
the last year or so that I felt were personally offensive.  But if it
were known that we have the ability to moderate our own list, and that
we intend to keep the discussions polite, then I think that *alone*
would solve most of the problem.  I think it takes only a light touch
to prevent things from deteriorating.
