Agreed.  IMHO it's also less binding than the vote on Loomio because
it was done years ago before some currently active members were even
on the list.

&gt;<i> The reason we currently follow the decision rule is because we have no
</I>&gt;<i> other formal rule to follow, *not* because we're forced to follow it.
</I>&gt;<i> We follow it freely.
</I>
This is IMHO a big problem: It should have been the first thing
debated and decided when the list and web site were set up.  A
decision rule is the single most important thing for any governing
body to have.

&gt;<i> That means we're not forced to obey the supermajority of 80%, either.
</I>&gt;<i> When we (all of us, not just Votorola users) decide on a decision
</I>&gt;<i> rule, then it'll be our first *binding* decision rule.
</I>
We already did, on Loomio, and it's my simple majority with a minimum
of 1/3 registered voters voting yes rule (I really need a simpler
handle for that thing ;-)

&gt;<i> I'll back-link to this clarification discussion from:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Rules">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Rules</A>
</I>
I appreciate your efforts at getting us over this obstacle.
