<PRE>By requirements set i mean you seem to have two possibly opposing criteria:

1) something about internet democracy
2) something about better world

Generically I though it would be politic to reference your criteria as
having support from my particular proposal.

As far as databases and comparisons and urgency and priority I am not
inclined to go there right now.

Thank you for your reply.

Max

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think you did very well here and in the last sort of catalog post.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought of something to say.  Potentially multiple somethings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I clicked on the link you provided.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I got to the list of names of participants.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I came back here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What i would like to see is a linkage such that i can get to multiple
</I>&gt;<i> page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from my name.  Each page would have a &quot;good thing&quot; I would be supportive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of.  And why.  With the way it relates to your requirement set.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let us then see what we get after a bit.  I am thinking of a few words
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each page title and maybe these can eventually be linked from a list of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; titles.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here is the first thing that came to mind for an example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Support libraries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Provide Internet connectivity to 30% of USA population
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Provide research facilities to many people
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and:
