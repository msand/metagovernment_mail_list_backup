<PRE>The red line for me was the first threat of violence I received in
this list (no names).  It's not so much that I'm physically frightened
by that kind of thing, or even just &quot;offended&quot; by it, as you put it.
I'm more worried about the effects of us tolerating it.  If we don't
aim at a minimal level of civilized behaviour, but accept whatever is
thrown at us, then we'll lose the best people, attract the worst, and
slowly sink into a shithole.  I think that's pretty much guaranteed.

&gt;<i> I'm strongly opposed to this: Unless somebody is spamming the list or

</I>&gt;<i> on someone else being &quot;offended&quot; by their posts would be particularly
</I>&gt;<i> egregious: If we can't stomach dissent or profanity or personal
</I>&gt;<i> attacks or whatever ourselves IMHO that pretty much disqualifies us
