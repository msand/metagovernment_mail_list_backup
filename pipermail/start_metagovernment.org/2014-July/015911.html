Yes, I suppose you could. The only alternative I see to would be to go with an unmodified consensus model.
In a small group I&#8217;m not sure how one would *split the difference* between the two.

&gt;<i> I'd recommend leaving any mention of specific technology out of this
</I>&gt;<i> document. 
</I>
Right, I&#8217;m just in the initial draft phase of things. 
I put in the Loomio reference as suggestive of where we will likely begin.

&gt;<i> I'm still thinking two-phase for this process: The proposal gets rated
</I>&gt;<i> and approved by a special interest group during which the proposer can
</I>&gt;<i> change it at any time (sparing making the determination of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;substantially altered&quot; and consequent squabbling about whether a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal is valid or not, and the issue of quorum).  Once that group
</I>&gt;<i> somehow decides it's ready (and I would leave that to the group and
</I>&gt;<i> primarily the original proposer), they submit it to a vote of the full
</I>&gt;<i> membership during which it can't be altered.
</I>
My sense is that proposal development is ideally a collaborative process&#8230;.kinda like we&#8217;re doing here.  (Yeah, I know you don&#8217;t like that word :)
Maybe when the group increases in size, though it&#8217;s difficult to imagine ever turning that determination over to a &quot;special interest group&#8221;.

&gt;<i> I still like my &quot;25% yes votes&quot; quorum rule.  
</I>
I don&#8217;t understand. How does that work?

&gt;<i> With your proposed policy, I predict people trying to game the system by holding a vote
</I>&gt;<i> between Christmas and New Year's or during a power outage (or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever), and passing something with a tiny fraction of the
</I>&gt;<i> membership.
</I>
Hmmm. I suppose any system can be gamed, one way or the other. Trying to find the middle ground.


&gt;&gt;<i> Notification:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Notification of a proposal must be given to all members (of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Organization) immediately following introduction of the proposal. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notification must be easily verifiable and recorded in an online database
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is readily accessible to all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This one's tough.  Would simply sending an email be sufficient?  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> inclined to use time in my system.  Maybe have all votes close on the
</I>&gt;<i> 1st of the month.  Send an email to remind people, but if that email
</I>&gt;<i> gets spam filtered or whatever you still have a binding vote because
</I>&gt;<i> they should *know* to log in and check if something is running (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> thinking Sunday evening closing, but then I'm anticipating a much
</I>&gt;<i> busier government system).
</I>
A quorum isn&#8217;t possible until after one week following notification. (unless the entire membership agrees.)
And most notifications will be automatic using Loomio.

&gt;&gt;<i> Proxy:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If a member is unable to participate in the discussion and voting of any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> given proposal, or will be out of reach for any (reasonable) period of time,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and would like to be represented during their absence, they may select any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other member to be their proxy. The member selecting a proxy must notify the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Organization of their choice for proxy, as well as the proposal, or period
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of time, for which they will be absent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good, although Loomio doesn't support this.  
</I>
Not yet. One of Loomio&#8217;s best features (IMO) is their openness to adding features requested by their users.
They are about to add *modifiable* buttons.  I&#8217;m thinking one could possibly be used to track the *quorum* and maybe *proxies* as well.

&gt;&gt;<i> Discussion:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Discussion of a proposal may begin immediately following notification. Once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a quorum has been established, the discussion will remain open until there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are no unresolved objections.  If and when this occurs, any member of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quorum may call for a vote of consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You know my position on this one: If your (or really anyone's) purpose
</I>&gt;<i> is to preserve the target property as undeveloped open space, this is
</I>&gt;<i> the way to achieve it.
</I>
Grin.  yes.  such pessimism Scott! 
Though to some extent I agree. So much depends on the nature of the group (their coherence)...and their willingness to collaborate (or get beyond the individual ego).
I&#8217;ve experienced this and it&#8217;s quite empowering. I suspect it&#8217;s a phenomenon we are evolving into as a culture&#8230;maybe as a species. I&#8217;m holding the optimistic realm.  ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> Exigency Voting:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If a majority of an established quorum decides the proposal is both urgent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and crucial, they may pass a proposal with an exigency vote.
</I>
&gt;<i> This I predict would be the default operating mode.  
</I>
Maybe so. Again, looking for the middle ground. Perhaps there needs to be some distinctive definition of &#8220;urgent and crucial&#8221;.

&gt;<i> Again, if your goal is to preserve that land as open space, allowing
</I>&gt;<i> blocks is a great way to achieve it.
</I>
My thinking is that allowing &#8220;blocks&#8221;...along side the ability of the membership to expel someone who uses them irresponsibly should limit their abuse.

&gt;<i> The only thing I see missing is some mention of the &quot;executive
</I>&gt;<i> branch&quot;.  As you may know from my book, I consider how Managers are
</I>&gt;<i> chosen and an enumeration of their powers to be a key feature of how
</I>&gt;<i> successful organizations actually operate.  They have to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> make and implement the small decisions themselves, but there there has
</I>&gt;<i> to be built-in authority for the group to override and even replace
</I>&gt;<i> them if the need arises.
</I>
Right, our Food Coop has a store manager who answers to the BOD. 
The hybrid seems to be working pretty well.

&gt;<i> Do keep us posted as to the progress of this proposal, if only to
</I>&gt;<i> inform us when they decide to follow some lawyer's advice to structure
</I>&gt;<i> it like any other HOA ;-)
</I>
Grin. There it is again. 
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

Thanks for your feedback Scott, I do appreciate it.
