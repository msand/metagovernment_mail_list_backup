That story, and several like it, are covered in Boehm's book too.
Although those groups are very egalitarian and show a remarkable
degree of compassion and sharing when times are tough they are also
quite brutal when it comes to dealing with free-riders and other
problematic individuals.  They'll basically give them a break a few
times, then either banish them (which drastically reduces that
individual's chances of survival) or just take a democratic vote and
then kill them outright (there were no jails or mental hospitals in
the Pleistocene ;-)

Humans are a strange bunch, to be sure.  But speaking from an
engineering perspective I've found Evolutionary Psychology to be a
very useful microscope for examining and  understanding their behavior
(this after getting a PhD in Cognitive Psychology and having been
raised in an extended family of psychologists, including both of my
parents).

&gt;<i> US urban areas have about a 3 day food supply.  In case of a problem the
</I>&gt;<i> local emergency people are not there and it will be three days before

</I>
I certainly agree that we're a lot closer to the abyss than most
people believe.  And it won't even have to be anything dramatic like a
major disruption in the food supply to push us over the edge: Even the
*threat* of resource shortages can quickly lead to people giving up
their liberty to a totalitarian leader who promises to provide for
them.  It's what got Hitler elected as dictator, for example, on a
platform of increasing &quot;living space&quot;, the invasion of Poland being
him delivering on that promise.  I still think the best way to prevent
this would be to replace history with psychology in elementary school
education (i.e., it doesn't matter what happened, what matters is
understanding which psychological flaws *cause* things to happen), but
the next best thing is providing an alternative outlet for their
tendency to act out of fear. For example in a real direct democracy
fearmongering is going to be a lot less effective, the result being
that people will be far more likely to vote to banish or incarcerate
someone like Hitler than elect him dictator.  And other than that 25%
authoritarian contingent, they simply won't vote to invade Poland
themselves (as Altemeyer's Global Change Game experiments clearly
demonstrated).
  Regards,
    Scott
