<PRE>Meantime I assume the answer is 'none'.  You have ideas about a theory
(quotes below), but none (as yet) about how to put it into practice.

You're in good company, Henri.  It looks like 'none' will be a common
answer in this little survey.  But that should come as no surprise.
The reason we ask the question is because we don't know the answer.

&gt;<i> And you, Henri?  Maybe you can answer our question.  By what steps do
</I>&gt;<i> you hope to advance the field of participatory democracy, or otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> achieve an outcome that is beneficial to humanity?

&gt;<i> You have to understand first, what you can already observe in the
</I>&gt;<i> political arena. Why do representative structures build up? Take a
</I>&gt;<i> pen and paper draw some smilies and get an idea how structures of
</I>&gt;<i> dominance build up.  Democracy is not a consensual system. It is a
</I>&gt;<i> civilized form of war. But besides being stable because of that
</I>&gt;<i> fundation, it is economically optimal.  Democracy is not only given
</I>&gt;<i> naturally. It is free and great ans superb.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take two of your smilies and draw a circle around them. This first
</I>&gt;<i> group can dominate all others. No proposals needed!! But a program
</I>&gt;<i> on which one of the group acts as a politician and the other as a
</I>&gt;<i> voter. That is all you need to know to understand democracy. Groups
</I>&gt;<i> can cooperate with a coalition program. There is consensus within
</I>&gt;<i> groups and competition between them.

&gt;<i> Grab yourself a pen and a paper, put up an amount of smilies
</I>&gt;<i> voluntarily on the paper, draw a line around two of such smilies to
</I>&gt;<i> form a first group, and ask yourself why such group can dominate all
</I>&gt;<i> others? That is decentralized dominance. Unite et impera. Ask
</I>&gt;<i> yourself, what happens, if such group-buildings goes on. What ideal
</I>&gt;<i> structures come up? Work with contracts to get a civilized
</I>&gt;<i> version. And you are fit with democracy.
