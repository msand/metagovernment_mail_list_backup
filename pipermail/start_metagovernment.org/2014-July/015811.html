<PRE>Setting a high quorum in the beginning was a bad idea but understandable,
our experience in Airesis where different quorums could be set in each
proposal by the proposer itself shows that many proposals stuck because
where requested high participation, therefore we change and we add the time
constraints that can be set at the beginning of the proposal for the debate
time (obligatory),for the reflection time and finally for the vote windows
time. (the obligatory was by tree choice We discussed for months about this
issue and we had more than 8 different and complicated solution evaluated,
We settle for this and we have being happy with it. The result is that if
you care you participate!  The right quorum number, if you could not live
without could be searched by the median algorithm, Pietro proposed
this system when is necessary to search for a single numerical value I
think we can test it.
Kind Regards
Jacopo

PS I will not vote in a ML for such important matter maybe is time to test
another tool?

PPS The following is the result of *one of the proposals related to quorums
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.airesis.it/groups/il-gruppo-di-sviluppo-di-airesis/proposals/1067-criteri-di-personalizzazione-quorum-e-votazioni-troppa-libert-poca-democrazia">http://www.airesis.it/groups/il-gruppo-di-sviluppo-di-airesis/proposals/1067-criteri-di-personalizzazione-quorum-e-votazioni-troppa-libert-poca-democrazia</A>&gt;*
(
the discussion went for very long time in different proposals ) that the
Airesis development group decision made:

*Criteria for customization quorum and voting - too much freedom = a little
democracy?*


*(the solution that win was the N1, sorry for the poor translation, Google,
if you follow the link you can read all the debate and comments) *
Restriction on the freedom of the customization of quorums to avoid
exploitation

Problems
WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (1/1)

The ability to customize the quorum is really very beautiful, but in my
opinion too loose, exposing a group made to suffer for the decisions due to
inertia and lack of participation (see eg. Quorum Fast, really not very
demanding in terms of constraints) . It could be a weapon to drive some
decisions with actions lightning, giving little time for other members to
participate in the discussion and then bring it to a vote and tick
resolution by acting at the hands of a small group of willingness to agree
... if we think through a quorum with discussion time at night than 2 days,
is deliberating in favor of a severance millionaire in a CDA of a large
company acting through Airesis ...

Objectives
WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (0/0)

1. Allow a minimum level of democracy and shared for all proposals

2. Avoid exploitation and privileges mold oligarchic

Solution 1 :

Solution 1
WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (1/1)

1. Allow for each active participant within a group to declare the term of
consent and which it considers to be optimal with respect to the quorum
(via survey or voting within the context of the proposal to the
participation of the same proposal), in order to create a quorum weighted,
shared and dynamic (but with certain date, see below).

Set at the same time a maximum between 15-30 days. than the declared value
by the user, so in case of emergency if the participants agree on the need
... will be worth the weighted average. The maximum limit serves mainly to
limit the impact of the event in which participants Late \ obstructionists
fit values of the quorum required at time intervals of years in the future
... in order to block the proposal or artificially rising and
instrumentally the mean value.

Establishing a maximum value claimable, the resulting weighted average,
even if dynamic, in any case lead to a certain date with regard to the
conclusion of the debate.

2. The definition of the date and duration of the vote should go for a
share-level participants in the proposal.Each participant may declare the
value of life you want and declare its readiness to vote in a certain
period (up to 15-30days?) After which the system would be to weight the
mean value and choose the dates depending on the time frame in which it
would provided the largest number of users potentially voting. You could
take a cue from Doodle.

3. The same system (the active user and participant declares that the
values considered optimal and it yields an average of the maximum values
are fixed to avoid exploitation), could also be applied to the definition
of a quorum for voting.

In this way we will have greater sharing and democracy , eliminating much
of the centralization of power in the hands of today's spokesperson grupp i.

TIPS INTEGRATED:

- Order the proposals on the basis of their maturity or their proximity to
the achievement \ satisfying the quorum set

- The quorum should be inversely proportional to the availability of time
to compensate for the risk that an organized group face pass quietly a
proposal to the detriment of the group. Time low with low quorum favor over
this danger (DO FURTHER VERIFICATION)

CONSIDERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN PERSPECTIVE:

The solution proposed here is to be taken into account as a point of
arrival in a more general process of improvement of the software in the
coming months will bring a reduction in the power of the spokesperson

Solution 2 :

Solution 2
WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (1/1)

[+ Boris Scluzero]: leaving the situation as a present, you could introduce
a retrospective (eg, post-poll vote) to evaluate the process of &quot;drafting
of the proposal&quot; (including quorum)?
, I think only the collection of these data can be derived of useful
conclusions

Solution 3 :

Solution 3
WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (0/0)

AMENDMENT TO THE SOLUTION 1 [+ Luke Zanellato]:

It is considered useful to experiment with solution 1 Common Space of
proposals, while within groups would prefer to affect the adoption of such
a system to an appropriate setting to be configured properly.

Solution 4 :

Solution 4 - STATUS QUO
WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (0/0)

STATUS QUO -&gt; solution that it plans to leave the situation unchanged.
