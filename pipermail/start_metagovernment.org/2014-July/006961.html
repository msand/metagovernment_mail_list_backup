<PRE>There are two ways to make a decision:  agreement and combat.  On agreement
it would seem consensus is a best we can do.  I disagree.

Suppose I have my tyrant license and the obligations and privledges thereof
and am looking for a position.

I circulate my resume and start dating.  Eventually a group has a unanimous
vote to hire me.  Even though we were dating heavily I still turn them down.

I think the key is that we are not dealing here in voting within a group.
We are dating and I do not want to marry you and assume the obligations
thereof because of something I learned in the dating process. Or maybe
someone important publicly supported me but privately said no.

Sounds like a super elector in there!  But the process was of democratic
method.  And  so we might ask about super electors.

The topic generalized to division of power and separation of power.  The
last is important in the United States right now.  I call it a critical
point.  I have never seen it come up in this forum.
