<PRE>Outliers are what you concentrate on.  *You* throw them out because even
the 99% is unpredictable in any deep way.  And if your outlier is rare you
cannot learn anything by assuming there is a guassian distribution.  Gee.
But down to the end question:

There is no home page because I get too snarky thinking about why there is
not one.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Scott it seems to me that you started out saying consensus was
</I>&gt;<i> impossible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then we had my and Steve personal experience examples.  And my easy to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access quaker history example.  Now it becomes for you that consensus is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impossible except in homogenous groups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ever hear the term &quot;outlier&quot;?  In psychology, we wave a magic wand and
</I>&gt;<i> exclude them from the analysis (albeit usually with a disclaimer).
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that 1% of organizations can function with a consensus
</I>&gt;<i> decision rule is irrelevant to the operation of the MG web site, or
</I>&gt;<i> indeed 99% of the other organizations out there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You also say only the decision matters but not the reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sort of: The reason matters to the voters, but should not be encoded
</I>&gt;<i> in the law itself because, as I explained previously, there's no need
</I>&gt;<i> to agree on the reason, only the law itself.  Requiring agreement on
</I>&gt;<i> the reason only hinders making the decision yet offers no benefit to
</I>&gt;<i> the governed afterwards (at least assuming a civil law vs. a common
</I>&gt;<i> law legal system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will specify quakers in new jersey in 1740 were homogeneous.  Further
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; were a slave economy.  And they walked away from that.  I do not exactly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sure that that they were religious was the additional defining factor.
</I>&gt;<i>  Lots
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of homogenous religious groups end up killing each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True, although not as often as conflicting religious groups.  As an
</I>&gt;<i> aficionado of irony, I particularly enjoy the reports of Buddhists
</I>&gt;<i> attacking Muslims so much in the news recently, e.g.,:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/04/world/asia/myanmar-mandalay-religious-violence/">http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/04/world/asia/myanmar-mandalay-religious-violence/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone who knows anything about Buddhism must realize that this is an
</I>&gt;<i> incredible hypocrisy.  But then again, it makes perfect sense to me
</I>&gt;<i> because religion to me is not so much an expression of faith as an
</I>&gt;<i> expression of latent authoritarianism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I might suggest a critical element was the quakers right of conscience.
</I>&gt;<i>  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; am not that much of a 18th century scholar but at least I read what was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easily accessible on the net when I got interested.  I doubt you did.
</I>&gt;<i>  There
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a tendency for people to come up with  the first facile explanation
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; explains away inconvenient experiences.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me very abstract here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The axiom of choice says that every collection is a set.  If this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applicable to reality then every possible grouping of people is
</I>&gt;<i> homogeneous.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Speculative 100% consensus is inadequate because the reasons for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; electors to be in the consensus are not in synch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like handwaving to me.  Please deal with this specific example:
</I>&gt;<i> Do we have consensus on a new Home page?  If not, why not?
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
