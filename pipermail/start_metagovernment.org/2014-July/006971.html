<PRE>Jacopo said:
&gt;<i> Q - By what steps do you hope to advance the field of participatory
</I>&gt;<i> democracy (pd), or otherwise achieve an outcome that is beneficial
</I>&gt;<i> to humanity?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A - Is easy to demonstrate the unfitness of the past , recent, current
</I>&gt;<i> political establishment, (first step)
</I>
If this is a practical step, Jacopo, then how would you do it?  It
does not sound like a step to me, however, but only a justification,
or prior reason (cause) for moving forward.  So it's more theoretical
than practical.

&gt;<i> Is harder but not impossible to demonstrate that a participatory democracy
</I>&gt;<i> is beneficial to humanity, (second step)
</I>
Here too, how would you demonstrate this?  We want to know the steps
to reach the benefit.

&gt;<i> Here at MG we discuss the how but i feel that the discussion enter
</I>&gt;<i> into a loop and therefore is not producing an outcome. We discuss
</I>&gt;<i> about overplan and we, IMHO miss to act in such structured and
</I>&gt;<i> methodological way that [we are allowed] to* dynamically* change the
</I>&gt;<i> overplan if deemed necessary.
</I>
You can change your overplan any time you like, Jacopo, in any way.

In this thread, we want to know how *you* think we should move
forward.  That's your overplan by definition, and you can change it as
freely as you can change your mind.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The perfect participatory democracy must be flexible to adapt to the
</I>&gt;<i> contest, what is good in the US may not be appropriate in Italy and the
</I>&gt;<i> same for many different countries, The variables are many. Certainly I
</I>&gt;<i> believe that as the society evolve and &quot;connect&quot; more and more the
</I>&gt;<i> differences will diminish in time and there will be less need of
</I>&gt;<i> different methodology here and there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The set of rules each group (local,regional national etc) will set for
</I>&gt;<i> themselves  that can be shared will permit to federalize group to share
</I>&gt;<i> decision (third step) so that larger group will participate to the decision
</I>&gt;<i> where the interest are shared.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore we can elaborate that certain policies can be elaborated if
</I>&gt;<i> certain shared rules are accepted.
</I>&gt;<i> (certain here means very little because this will come from the
</I>&gt;<i> participatory process and will be defined by the rules that can be shared)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to bored you with my theories but I have the strongest feeling
</I>&gt;<i> that this will happen naturally and automatically. Unfortunately recent
</I>&gt;<i> Italian political evidence show that the participatory democracy movement
</I>&gt;<i> can be derailed easily if fall under any leadership. Therefore IMHO, ANY pd
</I>&gt;<i> model, where is present even the slightest delegated feature or leadership
</I>&gt;<i> structure, will eventually fail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i> Jacopo
