<PRE>Thanks for answering, Marc.  I have three questions (a-c):

Marc said:
&gt;<i> ... if I understand you right, there is not just one, but an
</I>&gt;<i> unlimited number of overplans around. Everyone could have it's own
</I>&gt;<i> overplan. That would make it hard to compare the designs against, to
</I>&gt;<i> find the common ground, I guess. ...  But if we would have found one
</I>&gt;<i> single overplan by consenus, than we could use this to identify
</I>&gt;<i> common ground as you suggested ...
</I>
Exactly.  If two technical designs specify the same overplan, then
common ground between them is at least *indicated*.  But whether
&quot;overplan&quot; belongs in your definition of &quot;common ground&quot;, I can't say.
Maybe it's better to leave it out for now.  So here's our latest
summary of the way forward, as I think you see it:

   Compare the technical designs
     |
     V

   Identify the common ground.
       * Here &quot;ground&quot; means a design pattern that's employed; or a
         requirement that must be met in order to implement a design;
         or a problem that the design would solve.
     |
     V

   Focus on the common ground


(a) What does &quot;focus&quot; mean here, Marc?  Suppose the previous step has
identified the common ground between two designs as being (say) a
shared requirement.  Wouldn't both teams of designers *already* be
focused on that shared requirement?  After all, by definition, their
designs cannot run without it.

I think all designers are already focused on *all* their design
grounds, which includes their *common* design grounds.  Maybe you mean
something like &quot;work together&quot; here, instead of &quot;focus&quot;?

(b) Then what?  After the design teams work together (or whatever) on
their common ground, what's the next step forward, if any?  Or is the
next step unknown at this stage, i.e. something to be filled in later?

&gt;<i> If we could agree on this [way forward], a next step might be to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss the questionnaire for the survey that we are currently
</I>&gt;<i> drafting at AG MFT?
</I>
(c) Before agreeing and moving forward in this way, would it make
sense to look at other, alternative ways of moving forward?  Or is
that unnecessary?  Or would it come later?

Mike
