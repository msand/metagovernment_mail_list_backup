<PRE>Wow!
a lot of interesting observation from Scott and from
Pietro, unfortunately I cannot decipher Max entry due to too many
subjective (metaphorical?) examples, I really can't!
But the analysis by Scott is deep and i catch some insight that was put by
parenthesis....
&quot;(none of us are trying to game this Home Page decision, are we?)&quot; This is
something I had sensed too.
I believe we agreed on a Condorcet ranking method and there is a lot of
them out there, that is not the issue, in Airesis we use Schulze that is
a Condorcet variation that bring a unambiguous decision.
But the problem is not the voting method that by slight differences may
bring the same result.
The problem rely on the construction method, how or like Pietro say HOW we
build the outcome of the proposal... in our case the text of the
metagovernment home page! This is the Graal or Holy Grail of consensus
building. In that sense I believe that Vilfredo did a great job because we
patiently use it enough to read trough all the &quot;mutations&quot;, for this I
think that Vilfredo will be better to build shorter sentences! Regarding
Airesis, as I say before I will not guide you through an Airesis proposal,
I know is working fine and more than a thousand people are using it on a
monthly basis to decide the rules in their groups and take decisions. When
the group will be ready to try it, it will. I suggest who ever try it to
take screen shot of the wizard guided process to show the decision that
must be addressed BEFORE opening a proposal. Another way is to decide them
previously and whoever open the proposal follow the agreed quorums.
Regardless if you do not test the platform you'll never know how it works.
I will ask to some of my colleague to join the group as observer and
facilitator once the first proposal is started.

Will be Simone Curini, Nicola Giulietti, Carlo Mion and Alessandro Rodi all
of them have good English knowledge and are deeply involved in the Airesis
project.

CC Simone, Nicola, Carlo and Alessandro
Regards
Jacopo

PS the result of the test in Airesis will NOT be binding, at least we can
relax and concentrate on the construction method.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Groups No!  Looks to me like you're just kicking the can down the road.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Assuming you can even get multiple groups (which I doubt), how would you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integrate the results?  It'd end up just like the Vilfredo experiment: Lots
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of candidate material, no decision.  Process rather than results.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Speaking of which, for those who aren't on Loomio, the Loomio vote for my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Home Page proposal failed 3 to 2.  None of the 3 no votes made any comment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about *why* they voted no other than a vague claim that it wasn't proper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> procedure to even hold a vote.  Which puzzles me.  I've read thousands of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pages of the research in this area over the last few months and yet never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> came across a single case like we have here where people insist on voting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the voting method before they vote on any particular issue.  Voting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems like Condorcet and Borda are *optimizations*, and will not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamentally alter the decisionmaking process.  Indeed, I'd be willing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bet that we'd come up with the same decision voting on each proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separately on Loomio and just picking the one with the most yes votes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Especially considering the main benefit of these other voting algorithms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is to thwart people trying to game the system by appealing to a subset of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the voters and relying on &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; to deal with the rest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (none of us are trying to game this Home Page decision, are we?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since none of them will deign to explain the justification for their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior I have very little to go on, but my gut tells me that the main
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem is still the fantasy about collaborative government and consensus,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disagreement about which is the very reason why the Home page was taken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down.  It also explains why Loomio gets such short shrift because it just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't even claim to support either even though it would work fine (albeit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhat inefficiently) for any decision we have to make.  As I see it our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main problem is not choosing a voting method, it's that members of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group can't even agree on what it means to make a group decision.  A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> secondary problem being that those members who insist on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaboration/consensus *also* refuse to debate that issue (e.g., *why*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isn't a vote on Loomio binding?) or indeed the issue of whether or not the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old decision rule (80% majority according to Ed) is even still in effect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Propose all the clever things you want, but if you're not willing to face
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the facts about human behavior (even *our* behavior) this group will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue to shed members who actually value getting things done over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handwaving, in which case we might as well ask Ed to just take down the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> site and sell the domain to somebody who actually wants to use it for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something productive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for Airesis, I'm willing to give that a try, but as I told Jacopo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previously, it didn't seem to be working correctly last time I tried it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the language barrier goes both ways (certainly his English is vastly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> superior to my Italian!)  If he wants to run a full beta-test of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software, count me in, but *he* will have to organize it and lead us
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through the process or it just isn't going to happen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another proposal: It occurs to me that another one of our problems a sort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of reverse Luddism, where we seem to be expecting some fancy new software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to magically reach inside each of our brains and extract (or worse,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manufacture) consensus.  Ain't going to happen.  There are few enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people involved now we could collaboratively design the Home Page using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just this mailing list, each of us just posting our requirements (as I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done *twice* now) and any one of us integrating the result to be confirmed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with another mailing-list vote.  If you agree, please post your list and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll volunteer to integrate with the understanding that anyone who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *doesn't* post their list has exercised their right to not vote and so we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therefore have a mandate to make a binding decision without them.  The only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remaining issue would be to establish quorum, which I'd propose to use a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> majority of the people who have posted to the list in the last 2 months
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (since the Home Page decision came up).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Scott
