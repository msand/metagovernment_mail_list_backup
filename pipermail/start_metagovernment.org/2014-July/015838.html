&gt;<i> Scott it seems to me that you started out saying consensus was impossible.

</I>
Ever hear the term &quot;outlier&quot;?  In psychology, we wave a magic wand and
exclude them from the analysis (albeit usually with a disclaimer).
The fact that 1% of organizations can function with a consensus
decision rule is irrelevant to the operation of the MG web site, or
indeed 99% of the other organizations out there.

&gt;<i> You also say only the decision matters but not the reason.
</I>
Sort of: The reason matters to the voters, but should not be encoded
in the law itself because, as I explained previously, there's no need
to agree on the reason, only the law itself.  Requiring agreement on
the reason only hinders making the decision yet offers no benefit to
the governed afterwards (at least assuming a civil law vs. a common
law legal system).

&gt;<i> I will specify quakers in new jersey in 1740 were homogeneous.  Further they
</I>&gt;<i> were a slave economy.  And they walked away from that.  I do not exactly
</I>&gt;<i> sure that that they were religious was the additional defining factor.  Lots
</I>&gt;<i> of homogenous religious groups end up killing each other.
</I>
True, although not as often as conflicting religious groups.  As an
aficionado of irony, I particularly enjoy the reports of Buddhists
attacking Muslims so much in the news recently, e.g.,:
<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/04/world/asia/myanmar-mandalay-religious-violence/">http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/04/world/asia/myanmar-mandalay-religious-violence/</A>

Anyone who knows anything about Buddhism must realize that this is an
incredible hypocrisy.  But then again, it makes perfect sense to me
because religion to me is not so much an expression of faith as an
expression of latent authoritarianism.

&gt;<i> I might suggest a critical element was the quakers right of conscience.  I
</I>&gt;<i> am not that much of a 18th century scholar but at least I read what was
</I>&gt;<i> easily accessible on the net when I got interested.  I doubt you did.  There
</I>&gt;<i> is a tendency for people to come up with  the first facile explanation that
</I>&gt;<i> explains away inconvenient experiences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me very abstract here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The axiom of choice says that every collection is a set.  If this is
</I>&gt;<i> applicable to reality then every possible grouping of people is homogeneous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speculative 100% consensus is inadequate because the reasons for the
</I>&gt;<i> electors to be in the consensus are not in synch.
</I>
Looks like handwaving to me.  Please deal with this specific example:
Do we have consensus on a new Home page?  If not, why not?
  Regards,
    Scott
