I'm not sure, yet.  These appear to be practical steps as requested
(thanks), but I can't picture what you mean by &quot;common ground&quot;.  Can
you give a few specific examples, just to make it clear?

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is a very good idea!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the following I would like to refer to current approaches regarding your 
</I>&gt;<i> list (<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/soc/des-22">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/soc/des-22</A>) as &quot;designs&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We at AG MFT currently prepare a questionnaire to follow up with a survey 
</I>&gt;<i> where any of this designs could give their feedback in a quite structured 
</I>&gt;<i> form.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For this purpose we are customizing an existing tool called &quot;PM Delta&quot; to 
</I>&gt;<i> contain our specific set of questions. This tool is able to analyse the 
</I>&gt;<i> survey and provide some sophisticated reports.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be honest, til now we just thought about rough categorizations of the 
</I>&gt;<i> designs, but maybe we could enhance this with a structure that makes it 
</I>&gt;<i> easier to compare the different overplans? But for the beginning we think it 
</I>&gt;<i> might be easier to give specific categories to choose from.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we could proceed as following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) AG MFT is close to finish a first draft of the questionary for the 
</I>&gt;<i> survey.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) As soon as we have completed our proposal, we are going to put it for 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion on the metagov list. Here we could shape the categories and 
</I>&gt;<i> questions together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (3) After gaining a specific degree of agreement, we try to get as many 
</I>&gt;<i> designs as possible to participate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (4) Then we analyse this with PM Delta. The outcome of the analysis should 
</I>&gt;<i> be a better understanding of how the different designs are related to each 
</I>&gt;<i> other. How big or small the common ground is, to build upon. What are the 
</I>&gt;<i> aspects that separate and connect us.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (5) Then we focus on the things that connect us rather than separate us!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> Marc
