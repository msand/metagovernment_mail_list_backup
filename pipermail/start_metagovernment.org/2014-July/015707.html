<PRE>In this thread, we're discussing overplans (step-wise ways forward)
and the idea of comparing them.  So basically this thread is about:

  (1) Overplans and comparative overplanning

Mark, you bring up two additional topics:

  (2) qKonsens, a new tool your team is developing
  (3) How qKonsens might be used in overplanning

Could we discuss those in separate threads?  We should probably wait
till someone has a clear understanding of both (1) and (2) before we
open thread (3), in which we discuss the combination.

&gt;<i> &gt; In your work with AG Meinungsfindungstool and the German Pirates,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for instance, you hope to achieve an outcome that's helpful to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; humanity.  If you were to name that outcome and list the steps to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it, then that would be an overplan.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay...
</I>
So now I guess you roughly understand what overplans are.

&gt;<i> ... So with qK (in its final version) we - as metagovernment - could
</I>&gt;<i> define those stations necessary to compare overplans and then
</I>&gt;<i> everyone is invited to create her own overplan within qK. ...
</I>
Technically we might do that.  I assume qKonsens can host a catalogue
of texts, because overplans are texts.  But politically I think it
would fail.  We'd never get competitors (like you and me) to work from
an overplan catalogue that's hosted by a rival competitor.  Even if
Metagov deploys its own instance of qKonsens independently of the
German Pirate Party and AG Meinungsfindungstool, it would still be
tied to those two.  It wouldn't be neutral.

The Metagov wiki, however, is feasible on both technical and political
grounds.  Ideally qKonsens could still be used in the context of the
wiki by whoever chooses to use it, and I hope we can work together to
make that choice possible.  We've already installed a device in the
wiki for this purpose: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Toolset_switch">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Toolset_switch</A>

Please let's discuss these technical topics in separate threads.  This
thread I hope to reserve for basic discussion of overplans, if anyone
still has questions, etc, about what they are.

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's interesting that qKonsens would allow that kind of customization.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Usually when a process is formalized into steps, they're hard coded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right. But that way qK aligns to whatever process you have and whatever 
</I>&gt;<i> steps you need.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From what I understand, qKonsens &quot;stations&quot; and Metagov &quot;overplans&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are different.  I think stations have these characteristics:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * The station is a group choice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Its steps are executed by the group
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not necessarily. Also a single person could define stations and execute it 
</I>&gt;<i> as steps of a process (e.g. the steps to execute the overplan). But IMHO 
</I>&gt;<i> that would not make much sense in a cooperative environment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * The scope of action may be large or small
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * The purpose of any two stations may differ; stations are used to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      further any kind of action
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure if I understand what you are saying here. Stations are more like 
</I>&gt;<i> different states of a process. Therefore the station represents the current 
</I>&gt;<i> state of a process and its current results. After the transition from one 
</I>&gt;<i> state to another, the next state could use the results from other stations 
</I>&gt;<i> without the need of discussing them again. It's a kind of separation of 
</I>&gt;<i> concerns.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagov overplans differ as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * The overplan is an individual choice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * Its steps are executed by the individual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * The scope of action is always very large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    * The purpose of any two overplans is the same: to move the entire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      field of participatory democracy forward, or more generally to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      move the whole of humanity forward
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In your work with AG Meinungsfindungstool and the German Pirates, for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instance, you hope to achieve an outcome that's helpful to humanity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you were to name that outcome and list the steps to it, then that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be an overplan.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay. I focused more on this CoP, SoP, ToP, XoP flow of actions in your 
</I>&gt;<i> description (<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/c/NxRO">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/c/NxRO</A>). I thought this 
</I>&gt;<i> are the steps to be represented with the qK Station concept. So with qK (in 
</I>&gt;<i> its final version) we - as metagovernment - could define those stations 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to compare overplans and then everyone is invited to create her 
</I>&gt;<i> own overplan within qK. Of course for each overplan the author (or group) 
</I>&gt;<i> could define stations that might represent the steps necessary to execute 
</I>&gt;<i> the overplan itself. Those station could then be discussed within a 
</I>&gt;<i> discourse of its own.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The definition was unclear before, so I re-wrote the wiki page to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it clearer.  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure if I got it now?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> Marc
