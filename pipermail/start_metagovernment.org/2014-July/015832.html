</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new supporters or refine their proposal ...to something more specific,
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; caters more to their needs then what was possible when they were still
</I>&gt;<i> 5...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Who knows what this all grows into.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what do you mean with &quot;gridlock&quot; or &quot;status quo&quot; in the above described
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; context?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, that sounds not so much like &quot;gridlock&quot; as it does &quot;anarchy&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly &quot;gridlock&quot; and long-term preservation of the status quo are
</I>&gt;<i> part of it, but you're apparently proposing an even less effective
</I>&gt;<i> government than that.  I can just see applying this philosophy to the
</I>&gt;<i> question of whether you need to leash your dog when walking on a
</I>&gt;<i> public street: The petless &quot;hardliners&quot; will insist that no dogs be
</I>&gt;<i> allowed on public streets at all and the pitbull owners will just let
</I>&gt;<i> their dogs run at large with no supervision whatsoever because that's
</I>&gt;<i> just the kind of hairpins they are.  And there's no one to stop them
</I>&gt;<i> because it will take 20 or 30 years to make a decision that's binding
</I>&gt;<i> on everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

1. Regarding &quot;some&quot; proposals, like the stuff that you can usually read on
the first pages in countries constitutions, are probably not &quot;islands&quot;
2. Some &quot;not so important&quot; or more &quot;cutting edge issues&quot; are more &quot;islandish

Of course:
If the method i am proposing would be used by governments TOMORROW, this
would end up in chaos.
BUT: It will not be used by the general public soon, so it is a useful
mechanism to build consensus while not being &quot;important&quot; yet.
The time, that this proposed method will transition into mainstream is the
time, when the proposed mechanism has build enough consensus on enough
proposals

It can be used in smaller communities right now and those small communities
can grow into larger following this method.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Again, the purpose of government is to enable collective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decisionmaking.  Without decisionmaking, there is no government.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Decisionmaking is meaningless without &quot;Scope&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is the scope of the decision? This is what i wanted to question with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above example...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;scope&quot; is obviously physical: You can't make a decision about
</I>&gt;<i> whether dogs must be leashed on *my* street unless you also live on
</I>&gt;<i> (or maybe have to use) that street.
</I>

In some cases it might be &quot;physical&quot;, but not in all.


&gt;<i> But your &quot;islands&quot; unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> are theoretical whereas streets and taxation districts and human
</I>&gt;<i> beings are physical.  Until you can explain how dogs will obey your
</I>&gt;<i> theoretical island boundaries, I submit that your proposal is simply
</I>&gt;<i> unworkable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There will be lots of problems how to scope which kind of issue/proposal
and it has to be discussed by those involved.
Thats why the method i am proposing gives the freedom it needs and this
&quot;new system&quot; doesnt have to be effective over night, but
it allows us to get started. Otherwise we are stuck.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that this home page project has clearly shown that this is the case,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can we get back to the business of government by making a decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; about what to put on it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we follow the above mentioned process, we should do two things:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. come up with multiple decisions, each of which has 100% consensus,
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means, &quot;worst case&quot; we come up with as many decisions as we are
</I>&gt;<i> partcipants
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in this discussion + we need then equally many &quot;metagovernment front
</I>&gt;<i> pages&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and maybe the frontpage should be nothing more than a LIST of those many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FRONT PAGES.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Um, I'm thinking this is another example of &quot;unworkable&quot;...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Why? Even after reading my above given explanations?



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe if one &quot;FRONT PAGE&quot; has more support, it shows up further on top of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that list of &quot;FRONT PAGES&quot; which would give motivation to continue the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussion to &quot;unite&quot; the &quot;FRONT PAGES&quot; :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...so each of us could or could not participate in the discussion and
</I>&gt;<i> nobody
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could block anyone else by not participating or being against a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hey, I like visionaries and idealists as much as anyone, but at some
</I>&gt;<i> point &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot; and &quot;the rubber hits the road&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> When you get a little closer to that point in your design by all means
</I>&gt;<i> bring this idea up again.  Mean time, we've got an actual *single*
</I>&gt;<i> home page to develop.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Do we have to create a &quot;single home page&quot; ???
