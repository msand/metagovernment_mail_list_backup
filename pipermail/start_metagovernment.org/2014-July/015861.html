<PRE>Here&#8217;s an interesting article on the Cephu phenomenon.

<A HREF="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_evolution/2012/10/groups_and_gossip_drove_the_evolution_of_human_nature.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_evolution/2012/10/groups_and_gossip_drove_the_evolution_of_human_nature.html</A>

It describes gossip as being the most widely used (and powerful) form of controlling aberrant behavior in a tribal culture.

Given that contemporary tribal culture is operating to such a large degree online, I&#8217;m trying to imagine how that would work&#8230;.(e.g.) on a troll in a forum environment.

</I>&gt;<i> Humans are a strange bunch, to be sure.  But speaking from an

</I>&gt;<i> (this after getting a PhD in Cognitive Psychology and having been
</I>&gt;<i> raised in an extended family of psychologists, including both of my
</I>&gt;<i> parents).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> US urban areas have about a 3 day food supply.  In case of a problem the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> local emergency people are not there and it will be three days before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outside help is available.  If that is not going to arrive in a timely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fashion then your fiat money will not buy food.  And then who will feed you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and why?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I certainly agree that we're a lot closer to the abyss than most
</I>&gt;<i> people believe.  And it won't even have to be anything dramatic like a
</I>&gt;<i> major disruption in the food supply to push us over the edge: Even the
</I>&gt;<i> *threat* of resource shortages can quickly lead to people giving up
</I>&gt;<i> their liberty to a totalitarian leader who promises to provide for
</I>&gt;<i> them.  It's what got Hitler elected as dictator, for example, on a
</I>&gt;<i> platform of increasing &quot;living space&quot;, the invasion of Poland being
</I>&gt;<i> him delivering on that promise.  I still think the best way to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> this would be to replace history with psychology in elementary school
</I>&gt;<i> education (i.e., it doesn't matter what happened, what matters is
</I>&gt;<i> understanding which psychological flaws *cause* things to happen), but
</I>&gt;<i> the next best thing is providing an alternative outlet for their
</I>&gt;<i> tendency to act out of fear. For example in a real direct democracy
</I>&gt;<i> fearmongering is going to be a lot less effective, the result being
</I>&gt;<i> that people will be far more likely to vote to banish or incarcerate
</I>&gt;<i> someone like Hitler than elect him dictator.  And other than that 25%
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian contingent, they simply won't vote to invade Poland
</I>&gt;<i> themselves (as Altemeyer's Global Change Game experiments clearly
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrated).
