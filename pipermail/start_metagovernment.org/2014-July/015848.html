<PRE>Here is my offer of useful on Scott's proposal:

It need not be so ahistorical. The earliest example of direct democracy in
western civ that comes to mind is Athens.

The ones I work around as a goal are items like the Thing and some current
examples that scale to 5000 people.  This is probably influenced by recent
local behaviors around say 1880.

The interesting part is the idea of community as people who want to see
each other face to face even without governance decisions to be made.  Thus
I find the technology orientation to be needful of wideness.  How do you
enhance a big celebration?

&gt;<i> I've started a new vote on Loomio for my proposed new Home page.  The
</I>&gt;<i> previously approved decision rule (simple majority with a minimum of
</I>&gt;<i> 1/3 of registered voters voting yes) will be used and any &quot;block&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> votes will simply be counted as no.  Comments and &quot;forks&quot; of the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal are welcome and I'll update the proposal and restart the
</I>&gt;<i> voting if I find any of them compelling. Closing date is Wednesday,
</I>&gt;<i> July 23rd, which is one week from today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No votes on this list will count as anyone who's serious about the MG
</I>&gt;<i> project should have a Loomio account anyway and there is no way to
</I>&gt;<i> integrate the systems.  But if you want to view the proposed text
</I>&gt;<i> without or before voting, I've temporarily put it as my &quot;user&quot; page on
</I>&gt;<i> the MG site:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Metamerman">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Metamerman</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the process of developing this page I think I've also come up with
</I>&gt;<i> a possible compromise on the issue of &quot;collaboration&quot;, which I don't
</I>&gt;<i> have any problem with in principle.  My problem with it is in
</I>&gt;<i> practice, as was demonstrated by our Vilfredo run: I just don't see
</I>&gt;<i> how any of the existing systems that promise that will work to run an
</I>&gt;<i> actual government, and I don't have any faith that people working on
</I>&gt;<i> them really grok authoritarian and other irrational behavior or have
</I>&gt;<i> specifically dealt with it in their designs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nevertheless, I'm certainly open to the possibility that deeply
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative systems will be implementable in the future.  So the
</I>&gt;<i> compromise would be that we publicly acknowledge that we have a two
</I>&gt;<i> phase philosophy, the first phase being adoption of a simple direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy along the lines of my proposal or Loomio, and the second
</I>&gt;<i> phase being a more fully integrated collaborative system.  This
</I>&gt;<i> approach is necessary for two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The science and technology for deep collaboration simply isn't
</I>&gt;<i> developed enough yet, whereas that for simpler direct democracy is
</I>&gt;<i> already in our hands.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It's too big of a leap: The People are just not ready to put their
</I>&gt;<i> lives in the hands of something like Blinap (and Ned and I have
</I>&gt;<i> already had this conversation), promising though the concepts behind
</I>&gt;<i> it might be.  But once they're working in a functioning
</I>&gt;<i> direct-democracy system, they might be willing to take that next step.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can get behind this two-phase proposal, please vote to approve
</I>&gt;<i> my Home Page and we'll work on updating the pages on the web site that
</I>&gt;<i> address collaborative development and consensus-building to reflect
</I>&gt;<i> this compromise.

</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
