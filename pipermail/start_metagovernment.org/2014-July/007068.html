<PRE>Hi Guys,
I am being a little stretched, hence delays. I can't comment on your
proposal because it hasn't sunk in yet. However, I was gobbling together a
more palpable, less theoretical 'story' of my thoughts on the subject.
Clearly from an entirely different perspective.

I noticed that my previous elaboration on trustless architecture was very
abstract and I meet people and talked to them and thought I could make it
obvious but the problem is that it is rather hard to grasp. I try to make
it more tangible with a concrete example.
I am a bit sorry for pushing so much stuff on the mailing list but if you
bother to read it you'll certainly get the point I was trying to make
earlier.
As prerequisite you should have some knowledge about Accountancy, Bitcoin,
the blockchain and advanced concepts like Ethereum/Maidsafe (trustless
computation)

*1. The basics*
I came across the hippy commune house management software, it&#8217;s basically a
perfect starting ground. Think of the commune as people who have to trust
each other to fulfill certain tasks. In essence the house may need 10h of
attention every week, cleaning, taking the garbage out, sweeping the porch,
washing the dishes etc.
Everybody who had flat mates knows this problem and it gets more
complicated as more people live together.

A trustless implementation would be that we issue a token that represents
1h of community work. They are created on a linear curve, say every week 10
token. The number of token issued may raise or fall with the number of
people currently occupying the building.

Everybody gets a token and the idea is to get rid of them because they
present the obligation to do something. If you have too many token it&#8217;s
obvious that you are the lazy bum. Think of it like a bitcoin that is
returned to the wallet of the &#8216;house&#8217;. The &#8216;house&#8217; is an autonomous agent,
let&#8217;s say a fork of Bitcoin with a few tweaks. It can easily life on
Ethereum.

A simple implementation would for example mean that we have a trigger in
order to acknowledge a token as spent. For that 2 people would have to
confirm that a 3rd person has attended to a certain task. Like cleaning the
bathroom and the transaction of on House-Token from this person back to
house wallet is confirmed.

For that, a person proposes to do a certain task and if accomplished 2
others acknowledge it and one token is spent.

With that each of the 10 people in the house is presented with the
challenge to find a task every week to get his balance to 0. If one person
doesn&#8217;t do something for a while he would obviously accumulate a number of
token. As such, pressure mounts to contribute. It makes maintaining the
house very orderly and straight forward.

Outside of the house there would be no purpose for this specific
house-token (currency?) but for the inhabitants it&#8217;s an important metric.

All of that could be created for example with a &#8216;contract&#8217; on Ethereum.

Now think this further. As we have the house &#8216;application&#8217; anyway making
sure the house is maintained why couldn&#8217;t it do other things as well?
Technically it&#8217;s not hard to imagine that there may be a sensor that
notices when a light bulb reached its end of life. Now the improved
House-OS could check online what a new light bulb cost and hire a
contractor to exchange it.

Nobody would noticed that the light bulb went out except the House-OS, in
real time. It can simply query 2000 houses in the neighborhood and find out
what the most efficient course of action would be to fix it. Once done, it
pays the contractor with a little allowance of Bitcoin that it keeps in
escrow and notifies it&#8217;s inhabitant about the expense.

Think even further, light is energy, it&#8217;s already easily measured. The
house could read the meter. What would be the trouble to find out how
inhabitants made use of the light bulb? Their smartphone would indicate
their presence in the room and so the bill would be split accordingly.
Maybe one particular person used the lamp 80% of the time to study and so
others wouldn&#8217;t have to pay for something they didn&#8217;t use.

Thinking this even further drives also the message home that this couldn&#8217;t
be done by some central authority because trust would have to be proxied to
so many people that hardly anybody would want to life in an iHouse made by
Apple. The implications would be too severe. Not even to mention the fact
that you&#8217;d have the NSA as flat mate as well. But on a blockchain it&#8217;d be
trustless. No authority could interfere. There is only you. Your house
stays your castle. It doesn&#8217;t need to push advertisements into your living
room or try to up-sell you because it adheres only to the open source
algorithm that life&#8217;s on the blockchain and no corporate finance scheme.

This could be even abstracted further, to bring up another example, a guy
at google proposed a self-driving car that could own itself!
<A HREF="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129553.700-bitcoin-how-its-core-technology-will-change-the-world.html#null">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129553.700-bitcoin-how-its-core-technology-will-change-the-world.html#null</A>

And it goes further! The car is just a smart property and the algorithm
could just be some &#8220;Mobility&#8221; or &#8220;Transportation&#8221; App that runs on your
Personal Operating System. It would just organize a way of transportation
according to your priorities of speed, price or comfort.

Only think about trust and all of a sudden it becomes clear how
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are better stewards then
centralized organizations driven by agency, human self-interest.

But you wonder what all of that has to do with voting and liquid democracy?

*2. How would it look like?*

Let me bring up another example that may hit closer to home. Let me
introduce you to Johanna Doe. Let her life in the previous mentioned house
and assume that she is mid-aged, tired of her 9 to 5 job and eager to
fulfill her life dream of opening a restaurant. She is a gifted chef and
all her friends know it, but she has been working as a Consultant and has
also 2 dependable children which force her to stay put. She couldn&#8217;t take
any risk, right?

Of course under current conditions she could go to a bank, mortgage off her
few belongings and her kids&#8217; future and give it a try. Never mind that she
couldn&#8217;t return to the the save job she has and her future would be
shattered if that didn&#8217;t work out. - Clearly, she wouldn&#8217;t take the risk to
open the restaurant today.
But after implementing the blockchain technology at home she figures that
with it she doesn&#8217;t need a bank! She can just run her own IPO and limit her
exposure by substituting it with the trust that all her friends put into
her.

Instead, she puts up 25k of her savings as upfront investment and uses
another blockchain-contract on the trustless layer to issue a new token.
It&#8217;s Johana&#8217;s Restaurant-Share-Token and she issues 100 of them.

She can only back it with 25k but she needs 250k to get off the ground.
Under current conditions &#8216;investing&#8217; in her would be a crazy complicated
task because it would involve so many layers of trust like lawyers working
out agreements, banks, rating agencies, accountants and all the government
regulation.

On the blockchain she can simply issue the token and give the trustless
application the ability to distribute her initial investment equally to
everybody who bought a token in the event of insolvency. She can also
attach the business to it.

Not only that is possible but Johanna is smart so she also tabs into a
broader market. She issues a second token that allows its owners to have a
dinner of their choice + a drink. She structures the trustless contract so
that these token are valid for 3 years after the official opening. Here we
witness the birth of Johana&#8217;s Restaurant-EAT-Token.

All of that is super frictionless and basically just requires the exchange
of 2 hash codes for anybody to join in.

In order to raise awareness she starts organizing dinner parties and
advertises it to friends, family her community and also some kind of
Kickstarter online.

It&#8217;s easy to see that for example Herbert who just attends one of her
dinner parties and is enchanted by the delicious feast just procures with a
tap on his smartphone 25 Restaurant-Eat-Tokens for 250 and also one
Restaurant-Share-Token.

No 3rd party is involved, he can trust everything because the
Contract-Applications are open source, peer reviewed and operate on a
trustless layer. Nobody can interfere with it, neither Johana nor any
arbitrary trust-monopolist who would like to coherence a profit out of
either party.

Now Herbert&#8217;s ledger would look like below:
25 Restaurant-Eat-Tokens -&gt; He paid 250
// The value of a future menu is estimated to be 20; implied value = 500
1 Restaurant-Share-Token -&gt; He paid 250k/100= 2.5k
// 2.5k is the initial value but Johana has provided only 25k/100=250 as
collateral
-&gt; In addition he assumes the liquidation value of the enterprise if it
fails would be at least 100k (average for Restaurants).

His value at Risk is 2500-250(Collateral)-1000(Liquidation value)= 1250,
this is additionally offset with the spread between cost and price of
Restaurant-Eat-Tokens of 250.
Final value at risk: 1000.

- He believes that Johanna is a great chef and even if he lost 1000 he is
really proud of supporting this endeavor (important he is not an anonymous
shareholder!)
And if it succeeds, his investment may even pay out handsomely. He is part
of the story because he will bring his friends to the place and spent his
Restaurant-Eat-Tokens.

Obviously due to the frictionless, secure and easy to use of the blockchain
implementation Johanna manages to sell 50 Restaurant-Share-Token for 125k
and another 2500 Restaurant-Eat-Tokens because all her friends on the
trustless implementation of a social-network just buy some like they would
have done with a click on &#8220;like&#8221; in the old days.

In the end, after the money is raised and she got the lease for the place
she can quit her job and get going. Important: No interest payments, no
debt service, no mortgage, no hassle!

Meet Maria, a smart venture capitalist with special taste-buds notices
Johanna&#8217;s potential and buys on the open market 25 Restaurant-SHARE-Token
for 500k because she sees an opportunity to bring her expertise into the
business and create a franchises later on.

One Restaurant-SHARE-Token is now valued at 10k (2.5k at issuance). The
total business is now valued at 1Mio.

## I AM MAD BECAUSE I READ UNTIL HERE AND STILL DON&#8217;T GET WHAT THIS HAS TO
DO WITH LIQUID DEMOCRACY!!!
-&gt; Follow me down the rabbit hole ...
<A HREF="https://piratenpad.de/p/trustless_democracy">https://piratenpad.de/p/trustless_democracy</A>

I guess this should give you some food of thought. Please let me know what
you think, I know its complex but please acknowledge that each part of it
is only exposed to the particular interest group. The trustless
architecture isn't a revolution but rather a way to make trust visible
which creates accountability. &#8220;Transparency cures almost every ill!&#8221;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forward to study it over the coming weeks as I find time. - However
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can't seem to find it, can you provide a link?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's been some initial talk in the Metagov list.  That's where I
</I>&gt;<i> first posted about the idea of comparing these step-wise plans.  That
</I>&gt;<i> was just before I posted it to you, Martin.  Here's the thread:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-June/006807.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-June/006807.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (so I cc them, also because I moot the idea of using their wiki)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic idea of comparing overplans (if that's a good name for them)
</I>&gt;<i> is itself a kind of overplan.  I drafted it up and posted it to the
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov wiki: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's mostly what the above thread is about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... I think my [specific] proposal and also yours Mike is in essence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really a bit away from the other approaches ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also wrote up a full, specific overplan (my own), which shows what
</I>&gt;<i> one might look like: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a lot more than the single step (DvI) that I first suggested to
</I>&gt;<i> you, Martin.  If anyone wants to discuss it, then it would probably be
</I>&gt;<i> a topic for a separate thread.  Here I hope we can talk about the much
</I>&gt;<i> simpler, basic idea of &quot;one step at a time&quot; (as Martin puts it), and
</I>&gt;<i> the idea of comparing the various step-wise plans that would emerge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... and during many recent Brunch and Lunch discussions I found that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is really hard to drive the idea of trustless architecture
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; home. Never mind opinion aggregation, as far as I understood it, as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is less applicable outside of a narrow scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Driving ideas...  I've been involved in attempts to drive the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> something or other into someone or other in this field for 7 years
</I>&gt;<i> with little to show for it.  We made progress as a small team.  We
</I>&gt;<i> spawned several good inventions in tight discussions by Skype or
</I>&gt;<i> email.  But we never made much progress communicating with rival
</I>&gt;<i> teams, or with a general audience, or uncommitted individuals (as in
</I>&gt;<i> lists), despite huge efforts.  Often the idea we wanted to communicate
</I>&gt;<i> was nothing but, &quot;Hey, let's cooperate on something (anything) at a
</I>&gt;<i> minimal level, and mature this field a little.&quot; *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So... One thing to like about this approach of comparing overplans (or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever we call them) is it seems to be unstoppable.  We don't really
</I>&gt;<i> need to convince anyone of the approach up front, or even explain it
</I>&gt;<i> (though probably we should try).  Instead it'll be enough to start
</I>&gt;<i> doing it.  Others will get sucked in willee nillee, because there's
</I>&gt;<i> just no reasonable alternative.  Or am I wrong?  Is there a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to the steps below?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    CoP    Compare the overplans (or whatever we call them)
</I>&gt;<i>     |
</I>&gt;<i>    SoP    Select the best overplan
</I>&gt;<i>     |
</I>&gt;<i>    ToP    Track discussion of the overplan
</I>&gt;<i>     |
</I>&gt;<i>    XoP    Execute the overplan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing to like about this approach is that you can never get
</I>&gt;<i> seriously stuck or lost.  You just keep following the steps of your
</I>&gt;<i> chosen overplan.  At worst, you'll have to cycle back to earlier steps
</I>&gt;<i> (like SoP) more often than you hoped.  But eventually you'll succeed,
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed.  Or again, am I wrong?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * One exception is Metagov where we hammered away for over 5 years.
</I>&gt;<i>    They were always a very open, democratic community, but now they're
</I>&gt;<i>    a neutral one, too.  They take no sides.  (I imagine that's partly
</I>&gt;<i>    because of Thomas and me, and our efforts there.)  So I figure the
</I>&gt;<i>    Metagov wiki is a good place to start posting overplans.
</I>&gt;<i>
