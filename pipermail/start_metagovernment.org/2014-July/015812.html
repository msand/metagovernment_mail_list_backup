<PRE>If anyone is interested here is the analysis of a very good system (was not
implemented because of usability issue) Dealing with quorum can be very
confusing for average thinker, choosing values may be too demanding.

We opted for a simplified solution

</I>&gt;<i> PPS The following is the result of *one of the proposals related to
</I>&gt;<i> quorums
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.airesis.it/groups/il-gruppo-di-sviluppo-di-airesis/proposals/1067-criteri-di-personalizzazione-quorum-e-votazioni-troppa-libert-poca-democrazia">http://www.airesis.it/groups/il-gruppo-di-sviluppo-di-airesis/proposals/1067-criteri-di-personalizzazione-quorum-e-votazioni-troppa-libert-poca-democrazia</A>&gt;* (
</I>&gt;<i> the discussion went for very long time in different proposals ) that the
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis development group decision made:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Criteria for customization quorum and voting - too much freedom = a
</I>&gt;<i> little democracy?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *(the solution that win was the N1, sorry for the poor translation,
</I>&gt;<i> Google, if you follow the link you can read all the debate and comments) *
</I>&gt;<i> Restriction on the freedom of the customization of quorums to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> exploitation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problems
</I>&gt;<i> WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (1/1)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ability to customize the quorum is really very beautiful, but in my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion too loose, exposing a group made to suffer for the decisions due to
</I>&gt;<i> inertia and lack of participation (see eg. Quorum Fast, really not very
</I>&gt;<i> demanding in terms of constraints) . It could be a weapon to drive some
</I>&gt;<i> decisions with actions lightning, giving little time for other members to
</I>&gt;<i> participate in the discussion and then bring it to a vote and tick
</I>&gt;<i> resolution by acting at the hands of a small group of willingness to agree
</I>&gt;<i> ... if we think through a quorum with discussion time at night than 2 days,
</I>&gt;<i> is deliberating in favor of a severance millionaire in a CDA of a large
</I>&gt;<i> company acting through Airesis ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Objectives
</I>&gt;<i> WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (0/0)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Allow a minimum level of democracy and shared for all proposals
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Avoid exploitation and privileges mold oligarchic
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solution 1 :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solution 1
</I>&gt;<i> WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (1/1)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Allow for each active participant within a group to declare the term of
</I>&gt;<i> consent and which it considers to be optimal with respect to the quorum
</I>&gt;<i> (via survey or voting within the context of the proposal to the
</I>&gt;<i> participation of the same proposal), in order to create a quorum weighted,
</I>&gt;<i> shared and dynamic (but with certain date, see below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Set at the same time a maximum between 15-30 days. than the declared value
</I>&gt;<i> by the user, so in case of emergency if the participants agree on the need
</I>&gt;<i> ... will be worth the weighted average. The maximum limit serves mainly to
</I>&gt;<i> limit the impact of the event in which participants Late \ obstructionists
</I>&gt;<i> fit values of the quorum required at time intervals of years in the future
</I>&gt;<i> ... in order to block the proposal or artificially rising and
</I>&gt;<i> instrumentally the mean value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Establishing a maximum value claimable, the resulting weighted average,
</I>&gt;<i> even if dynamic, in any case lead to a certain date with regard to the
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion of the debate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The definition of the date and duration of the vote should go for a
</I>&gt;<i> share-level participants in the proposal.Each participant may declare the
</I>&gt;<i> value of life you want and declare its readiness to vote in a certain
</I>&gt;<i> period (up to 15-30days?) After which the system would be to weight the
</I>&gt;<i> mean value and choose the dates depending on the time frame in which it
</I>&gt;<i> would provided the largest number of users potentially voting. You could
</I>&gt;<i> take a cue from Doodle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The same system (the active user and participant declares that the
</I>&gt;<i> values considered optimal and it yields an average of the maximum values
</I>&gt;<i> are fixed to avoid exploitation), could also be applied to the definition
</I>&gt;<i> of a quorum for voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this way we will have greater sharing and democracy , eliminating much
</I>&gt;<i> of the centralization of power in the hands of today's spokesperson grupp i.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TIPS INTEGRATED:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Order the proposals on the basis of their maturity or their proximity to
</I>&gt;<i> the achievement \ satisfying the quorum set
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The quorum should be inversely proportional to the availability of time
</I>&gt;<i> to compensate for the risk that an organized group face pass quietly a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to the detriment of the group. Time low with low quorum favor over
</I>&gt;<i> this danger (DO FURTHER VERIFICATION)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CONSIDERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN PERSPECTIVE:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The solution proposed here is to be taken into account as a point of
</I>&gt;<i> arrival in a more general process of improvement of the software in the
</I>&gt;<i> coming months will bring a reduction in the power of the spokesperson
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solution 2 :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solution 2
</I>&gt;<i> WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (1/1)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [+ Boris Scluzero]: leaving the situation as a present, you could
</I>&gt;<i> introduce a retrospective (eg, post-poll vote) to evaluate the process of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;drafting of the proposal&quot; (including quorum)?
</I>&gt;<i> , I think only the collection of these data can be derived of useful
</I>&gt;<i> conclusions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solution 3 :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solution 3
</I>&gt;<i> WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (0/0)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AMENDMENT TO THE SOLUTION 1 [+ Luke Zanellato]:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is considered useful to experiment with solution 1 Common Space of
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, while within groups would prefer to affect the adoption of such
</I>&gt;<i> a system to an appropriate setting to be configured properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solution 4 :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solution 4 - STATUS QUO
</I>&gt;<i> WRITE AND VIEW CONTRIBUTIONS (0/0)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> STATUS QUO -&gt; solution that it plans to leave the situation unchanged.
