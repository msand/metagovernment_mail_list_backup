Exactly!  

The way I see it, we&#8217;re a disparate group of individuals, each with our individual visions of how to successfully manage the decision making of an enormously (if not infinitely) complex system. Perhaps it&#8217;s a bit idealistic to imagine that any single vision (system or method) will ever sufficiently address the massive diversity of demand encompassed by the whole. Any comprehensive solution to the question &quot;How can we best govern ourselves?&#8221; will very likely include *most of the above*.

On a similar note...I personally don&#8217;t think our coming to *agreement* is either crucial or significant for what is actually developing within our group. In my mind, this list is a crucible. We discuss, challenge, argue, and debate in order to continually refine our individual visions with the feedback that comes from the unending brawl of 'justifiable' opinion. I think it&#8217;s futile to imagine that we will ever agree on anything substantial.  Or that we will ever really need to.   Maybe someday&#8230;..it&#8217;s a nice thought anyway.  ;-)

Until then, let&#8217;s put the *fun* back in &#8216;dysfunctional' and continue on with the &#8220;I&#8217;m right vs. No, I&#8217;m right&#8221; method.   I think it has potential&#8230;.as long as we don&#8217;t take ourselves (and our strategies to save democracy) too seriously.
