<PRE>Hi Michael,

It does depend on the
issue. The issue is a demand and
then software has to consider their opinion directly. For example the issue is
a demand about housing. It is a basic necessity that demand must be addressed. However
building the houses is a technical issue that needs scientific method approach. &#160;
The issue needs only opinion base resolution and then
software has to consider both direct democracy and liquid democracy. For
example security or foreign policies that need opinion based decisions. 
The issue is atechnical and then we have to use
scientific method as a primary method to resolve the problem. Direct democracy
should consider if people are well informed and educated on this issue. If
people don&#8217;t have knowledge but still they want to involve, then they can use
liquid democracy. For example energy production is highly technical issue that
can use scientific method, if the people have knowledge about energy production
and then they can participate directly and the people who don&#8217;t have knowledge
can use liquid democracy. In reality people don&#8217;t have knowledge about such
highly technical issues but we should have a software program that anybody can
participate on the issue as a matter of pure democratic principle.

Thank you!

-----&#160;
Russel

Thanks for replying Russel,

The problem as you see it is: (A) political decisions are based on the
opinion of the few, which (B) is a poor basis for political decisions.

What if political decisions were instead based on the opinion of
everyone affected by them?&#160; Would you still see a problem?

(Once we agree on the problem, we can look at where science fits in.)

&gt;<i> &#160;Hi Michael,&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;A. Political decisions are based on opinion -
</I>&gt;<i> yes
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; B. Opinion is a poor basis for political
</I>&gt;<i> decisions - yes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If so, what is your evidence for A?
</I>&gt;<i> As we know all
</I>&gt;<i> political decisions are made by hands of the few. They are so called
</I>&gt;<i> politicians. Their opinions are political decisions. In democracy, we have just
</I>&gt;<i> illusion of control. 
</I>&gt;<i> Evidence for political
</I>&gt;<i> decisions are based on opinion &#8211; How much money state print, foreign policy,
</I>&gt;<i> State security, education , transportation etc. are all based on opinions. All
</I>&gt;<i> political decisions are made by hand of the few politicians opinions. Our resources,
</I>&gt;<i> security, environment etc. manage by few people&#8217;s opinions. We called that
</I>&gt;<i> system politics.&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> Politics
</I>&gt;<i> I think politic is a
</I>&gt;<i> byproduct of two phenomenons.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Statism &#8211; Use of the
</I>&gt;<i> state power to achieve goals is politics. Who is having the state power? As we
</I>&gt;<i> everybody knows hands of the few. Why it is on the hand of few? Because it is
</I>&gt;<i> establish intuition to maintain the power of few. How the state established?
</I>&gt;<i> State arises as a result competing slave ownership. A large tribe with a slave
</I>&gt;<i> owner is called country. In fact present day country is a tribe with a flag and
</I>&gt;<i> anthem. State use our group behavior to accomplish state goal that maintain the
</I>&gt;<i> establish intuitions on the expense of human freedom and development. 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Failure of economics
</I>&gt;<i> &#8211; Economics is household management in Greek term. Historically we agricultural
</I>&gt;<i> humans had scarcity on supply of the products. That maintains the price base
</I>&gt;<i> economics such as capitalism, communism, socialism or fascism. However we
</I>&gt;<i> industrial humans obtain the technological capacity to produce more than we consume.
</I>&gt;<i> So growth and scarcity no longer exist to maintain the price of product, but
</I>&gt;<i> establish political institutions, banks and co operations want artificially
</I>&gt;<i> create scarcity and growth to maintain price structure. Politics is a byproduct
</I>&gt;<i> of fail economics. When people&#8217;s needs are meet exchange, money, politics are
</I>&gt;<i> obsolete. Educated people need no control. Even we need control we can have
</I>&gt;<i> that control with minimum human opinion.&#160; &#160;&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand not
</I>&gt;<i> only opinion is poor basis politics, politics itself limit our freedom and
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary phenomena for advance economic model such as resource based
</I>&gt;<i> economy. So I hope direct democracy can break the power of establish
</I>&gt;<i> institutions and people will have collective freedom to obtain resource based
</I>&gt;<i> economy that politics and opinions are irrelevant.&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you will
</I>&gt;<i> understand my view. If not please ask any questions. I will explain as much I can. 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank
</I>&gt;<i> you very much
</I>&gt;<i> Russel

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Russel,

</I>&gt;<i> Before looking at your proposed solution, I want to understand the

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; A. Political decisions are based on opinion
