<PRE>Hi guys and gals,

&gt;<i> The text flow is inconsistent between the grey areas (common)
</I>&gt;<i> and the hot pink areas (differences).  In the grey areas, I read from
</I>&gt;<i> left to right across the screen.  In the hot pink areas, I am tempted
</I>&gt;<i> to do the same, and that's wrong.  It confuses my eye.
</I>
I have combined the two layouts in a new one which focusses on identical text 
flow with a monospace font. (1) And the same logged in as Ed. (2) 
Problem: The difference #1 is actually two differences. This anomaly is caused 
by the layout. I could show max. two differently coloured checkboxes in this 
line as a workaround for this corner case, but more than two differences per 
line won't work that way. It is also confusing. Should I keep them joined or 
try to separate them in two differences? We could increase line spacing around 
this line as well to get space for more checkboxes.

I have also added written controls besides each avatar and an extended 
headline to quickly clarify what this interface is about. This might collide 
with the Crossforum header, so we have to sort that out as well. 

Criticism and proposals are very welcome :-)
