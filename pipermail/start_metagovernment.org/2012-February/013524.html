Ned&gt; I confess that I don't quite understand what you are saying here, 
or why you are saying it, or what it has to do with my remark that you 
quoted. (Sometimes I'm slow -- sorry.)


    Analysis Topic 1: Vote Power OR Proposal Power

Ned&gt; The &quot;tongue power&quot; I was referring to (I thought I was following 
your usage ...) is that of **giving reasons** for preferring one 
alternative over another. From the &quot;tongue power&quot; perspective, a vote is 
just a grunt -- a gesture. Beyond merely expressing preference, it is 
not usefully communicative -- it expresses no **reasons** for the choice 
made.

Ned&gt; In order to have collaborative governance, the **reasons** for 
preferences must be given. When I present a thesis that you don't find 
acceptable for various reasons, the most efficient and effective way to 
proceed is for you to articulate an **analysis** (analytically break out 
the parts you find problematic, and articulate the perspectives from 
which you see problems) and then propose **antitheses** (for each part, 
from each perspective, give the **reasons** that you find the part 
problematic). That then gives the two of us (and others who wish to be 
involved) the necessary information to be able to seek a synthesis that 
satisfies everyone. A sketch of the full recursive synthesis process 
might be [thesis &gt; analysis &gt; antitheses &gt; ... (recursive drilling down) 
... &gt; syntheses &gt; synthesis].

Ned&gt; As is done in Votorola, you could present an alternative thesis (or 
thesis fragment -- recombinant text) without articulating any analyses 
or antitheses, but that would leave me (and others) having to guess 
about **why** you prefer your thesis to mine. This would greatly hamper 
attempts by myself and others to come up with a synthesis that might 
satisfy us all. To get from thesis to synthesis most effectively and 
efficiently, it is highly helpful to go through analysis and antithesis.

Ned&gt; Using voting as a decision mechanism short-circuits this recursive 
synthesis process of communicating **reasons**. My suggestion is that we 
abandon voting entirely, and instead create a decision system that uses 
**proposing** (proposal = preference + reasons) as the decision 
mechanism. That is what I meant when I said &quot;I am a really big fan of 
tongue power -- I think that that's the way we should go.&quot;


    Analysis Topic 2: The Political Power of a Vote

Ned&gt; If all votes are weighted equally, then the **maximum** relative 
political power that each vote can have (in terms of its formal effect 
in making the legislative decision) is 1/N. When the voting population 
numbers (N) in the millions or billions, this is a vanishingly small 
serving of political power. I see an attempt to increase the political 
power of the vote of each citizen from zero to 1/N as an attempt to give 
each citizen a bigger thimble with which to try to bail out this global 
Titanic that we are on.


    Analysis Topic 3: The Other Structural Fault

Mike&gt; Nor could we claim (as I do) that the lack of that vote [carrying 
the full 1/N political power] is the root cause of political bondage, 
economic injustice and other widespread human rights violations [and 
war, poverty, biosphere degradation, fleecing future generations, etc.].

Ned&gt; After a legislative decision is made (even through full-power 1/N 
voting), the legislation is then handed over to hierarchs and 
capitalists and banksters for execution and adjudication. The governance 
systems of the hierarchs and the capitalists and banksters are not 
democratic: about the best that the general citizenry can do to try to 
affect those decisions is to stand out in the streets (in the freezing 
cold) waving signs.

Ned&gt; In my view, trying to create a voting system that increases the 
political power of the vote of each citizen from zero to 1/N is like 
trying to fix a crack in the legislative sidewalk (structural fault #1) 
of Jiminy Cricket Land. At the end of that sidewalk (at the point that 
the legislation is passed) lies the Grand Canyon (structural fault #2). 
On the other side of that Grand Canyon lies the Land of the Hierarchs 
and Capitalists and Banksters to which the legislation is passed, where 
democracy and collaboration are not to be found, and where political 
bondage, economic injustice, widespread human rights violations, etc. 
flourish -- it is the land where we all actually live, when we are not 
in Jiminy Cricket Land voting to generate better quality legislation for 
the hierarchs and capitalists and banksters to ignore.

Ned&gt; In order for collaborative governance to be able to actually 
produce good governance outcomes in the real world, the collaborative 
governance system must be capable of rendering hierarchies and 
capitalism and parasitic banking obsolete, which means that the system 
must be capable of making all of the governance decisions that hierarchs 
and capitalists and banksters now make, more effectively and efficiently 
than hierarchs and capitalists and banksters now make those decisions.

Ned&gt; To me it seems that resolving structural fault #1 without resolving 
structural fault #2 would be an empty gesture. And, any collaborative 
governance system that was capable of resolving structural fault #2 
would almost certainly also be capable of resolving structural fault #1 
as well. For both those reasons, I would suggest that we should be 
focusing on conceiving and creating a collaborative governance system 
capable of resolving structural fault #2.


    Analysis Topic 4: The &quot;Just Do It!&quot; Approach

Mike&gt; Would it [the full-power 1/N vote] really make a difference? I say 
yes, you say no, but really nobody knows because nobody ever tried it 
before. So we'll try it: we'll put a working ballot in the elector's 
hands and see what comes of it.

Ned&gt; There is indeed much to commend the &quot;Just Do It!&quot; approach. I wish 
you well with your experiment. (And also, we would all potentially be 
more effective in our quest to &quot;make things better&quot; if we could 
collaboratively work through to conceiving an experiment that we would 
all be willing to collaborate on running together. Our efforts and 
resources could then be synergistically rather than dysergistically 
employed.)


    Analysis Topic 5: Diagnosing The Primary Root Problem

Mike&gt; What is the root cause in your own theory?

Ned&gt; I see our primary root problem as being that some of the social 
arrangements we have now set up positive feedback loops that (over 
generations) steadily concentrate more and more wealth and power into 
fewer and fewer hands. These days, the three main social arrangement 
concentrators happen to be hierarchies, capitalism, and parasitic 
banking. In other times, other social arrangements have served to 
increasingly concentrate power.


    Analysis Topic 6: Solving The Primary Root Problem

Ned&gt; So long as we continue to be dependent on the decision making of 
hierarchs, capitalists, and banksters, we cannot remove them from power, 
nor render their roles and their systems obsolete. Therefore, we first 
need a fully operational collaborative governance *decision system* 
capable of making all of the decisions that hierarchs, capitalists, and 
banksters now make, more effectively and efficiently than they now make 
those decisions.

Ned&gt; As with the &quot;working ballot experiment&quot;, the &quot;full collaborative 
governance experiment&quot; has never been run before, and has not until now 
even been possible -- the new governance systems will need to use 
technologies that are only now available.


    Analysis Topic 7: Experimental Validation

Mike: Is it [your proposed root problem, your proposed governance 
solution] open to experimental validation?

Ned&gt; I would say yes. *Any* proposed root problem diagnosis, and any 
proposed governance system solution can be experimentally validated (at 
least indirectly). Governance systems produce governance outcomes (war, 
poverty, biosphere degradation, etc. on the &quot;bad&quot; side, citizens 
thriving and such on the &quot;good&quot; side) that are objectively observable 
and measurable phenomena. To determine whether a proposed problem 
diagnosis is valid, and whether a proposed solution does effectively 
resolve the problem, one would measure and track the governance 
*outcomes* produced by the decisions of the governance system. For 
example, if the diagnosis were that concentrated power is the root cause 
of wars, and the proposed governance system then leads to no more wars, 
that would constitute evidence (however fuzzy and disputable) that the 
diagnosis and solution were valid.
