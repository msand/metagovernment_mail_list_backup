<PRE>Ned&gt; Alex, Greetings! (I have not at all forgotten that I still have not 
responded to your second excellent critique on the Appraisal System 
thread back in July. I am working on two articles now that will have 
various responses to your critiques incorporated into them.)


    Creating &quot;Full-Spectrum&quot; Collaborative Governance Systems

Ned&gt;My thought is that, if we are actually going to be creating *new* 
kinds of governance systems (rather than merely &quot;pouring old wine into 
new bottles&quot;), that we should start out in a virtual laboratory: an 
online game that anyone in the world can play, in which the real world 
is mapped onto the game's virtual world, so that real world governance 
decisions (including virtual company decisions) can be made within the game.

Ned&gt;Scientists generally start in the laboratory when dealing with new 
and not yet understood systems, for good reason. If we were to start out 
in any sort of situation in which people's lives and livelihoods were at 
risk, we would not be able to play at the edges and have things blow up 
from time to time.

Ned&gt;As an example, all of the potential problems for the appraisal 
system that you have pointed to in your critiques are there. In the 
online game, we could plunge heedlessly ahead, study how the problems 
manifest (even inviting obnoxious people to try to break the systems), 
and figure out how to solve them -- without doing real-world damage in 
the process.

Ned&gt;Only after the new collaborative governance systems had proven 
themselves in the virtual world should anyone trust them in the real 
world. (*I* certainly wouldn't trust them until they had.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -- the new governance systems will need to use technologies that are 
</I>&gt;<i> only now available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about starting with &quot;full collaborative governance&quot; for 
</I>&gt;<i> companies? There is the corporate governance, there might be a court 
</I>&gt;<i> of arbitration, security guards, developement of vision, mission 
</I>&gt;<i> statement, and guiding principles, distribution of income streams, 
</I>&gt;<i> make-or-buy-decisions, operational execution, and so on....
</I>&gt;<i> In essence, what we have is a group of people that do selforganisation 
</I>&gt;<i> of their life's ...but in practice they find out, that because of 
</I>&gt;<i> special skills they have and special ressources they have access to, 
</I>&gt;<i> they do NOT selforganize their entire life, but use 
</I>&gt;<i> MAKE-OR-BUY-Decisions to cooperate with others (externals) ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> today, normal organisations are not really groups of people that work 
</I>&gt;<i> together at eye level, but instead they have hierarchies. There might 
</I>&gt;<i> be in fact companys that have very flat hierarchies but they still 
</I>&gt;<i> have them. some might use democracy as a mechanism but that often 
</I>&gt;<i> leads to the reign of the will of majority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what systems do we need to enable companys of partners to be 
</I>&gt;<i> founded adhoc and disbanded adhoc? If u have 5 people, thats probably 
</I>&gt;<i> not a big deal...what if its 50 people? what if its 500? what if its 
</I>&gt;<i> thousands? .....what if its millions - like whole nations?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What principle could be used to make it scale?
</I>&gt;<i> I like votorola, because it scales so nicely, but votorola is only 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the picture - maybe its hard to think about all the things a 
</I>&gt;<i> country has to take care of, we could start with something smaller, 
</I>&gt;<i> like companys... there are small companys and there are large companys 
</I>&gt;<i> - whats there needs?
</I>&gt;<i> maybe its possible to learn about skills that occupy people have and 
</I>&gt;<i> enable them to found their own OCCUPY COMPANYS that use alternative 
</I>&gt;<i> principles backed by the right open source software, that will enable 
</I>&gt;<i> them to be more effective than traditional companys... if thats the 
</I>&gt;<i> case, other companys might start to copy this principles and new 
</I>&gt;<i> startups might uses this mechanisms and so the experience of living in 
</I>&gt;<i> such a system will be spread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not only will it enable occupy to become independent of the 
</I>&gt;<i> traditional systems, because they can cater themselves, but also will 
</I>&gt;<i> they inspire others if they succeed.
</I>&gt;<i> Starting on a company level will also give us feedback of what works 
</I>&gt;<i> an what doesnt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> what do you think of it?

</I>&gt;<i>     world. Its effect would instead be incalculable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I confess that I don't quite understand what you are saying
</I>&gt;<i>     here, or why you are saying it, or what it has to do with my
</I>&gt;<i>     remark that you quoted. (Sometimes I'm slow -- sorry.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Analysis Topic 1: Vote Power OR Proposal Power
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; The &quot;tongue power&quot; I was referring to (I thought I was
</I>&gt;<i>     following your usage ...) is that of **giving reasons** for
</I>&gt;<i>     preferring one alternative over another. From the &quot;tongue power&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     perspective, a vote is just a grunt -- a gesture. Beyond merely
</I>&gt;<i>     expressing preference, it is not usefully communicative -- it
</I>&gt;<i>     expresses no **reasons** for the choice made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; In order to have collaborative governance, the **reasons**
</I>&gt;<i>     for preferences must be given. When I present a thesis that you
</I>&gt;<i>     don't find acceptable for various reasons, the most efficient and
</I>&gt;<i>     effective way to proceed is for you to articulate an **analysis**
</I>&gt;<i>     (analytically break out the parts you find problematic, and
</I>&gt;<i>     articulate the perspectives from which you see problems) and then
</I>&gt;<i>     propose **antitheses** (for each part, from each perspective, give
</I>&gt;<i>     the **reasons** that you find the part problematic). That then
</I>&gt;<i>     gives the two of us (and others who wish to be involved) the
</I>&gt;<i>     necessary information to be able to seek a synthesis that
</I>&gt;<i>     satisfies everyone. A sketch of the full recursive synthesis
</I>&gt;<i>     process might be [thesis &gt; analysis &gt; antitheses &gt; ... (recursive
</I>&gt;<i>     drilling down) ... &gt; syntheses &gt; synthesis].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; As is done in Votorola, you could present an alternative
</I>&gt;<i>     thesis (or thesis fragment -- recombinant text) without
</I>&gt;<i>     articulating any analyses or antitheses, but that would leave me
</I>&gt;<i>     (and others) having to guess about **why** you prefer your thesis
</I>&gt;<i>     to mine. This would greatly hamper attempts by myself and others
</I>&gt;<i>     to come up with a synthesis that might satisfy us all. To get from
</I>&gt;<i>     thesis to synthesis most effectively and efficiently, it is highly
</I>&gt;<i>     helpful to go through analysis and antithesis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Using voting as a decision mechanism short-circuits this
</I>&gt;<i>     recursive synthesis process of communicating **reasons**. My
</I>&gt;<i>     suggestion is that we abandon voting entirely, and instead create
</I>&gt;<i>     a decision system that uses **proposing** (proposal = preference +
</I>&gt;<i>     reasons) as the decision mechanism. That is what I meant when I
</I>&gt;<i>     said &quot;I am a really big fan of tongue power -- I think that that's
</I>&gt;<i>     the way we should go.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Analysis Topic 2: The Political Power of a Vote
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; If all votes are weighted equally, then the **maximum**
</I>&gt;<i>     relative political power that each vote can have (in terms of its
</I>&gt;<i>     formal effect in making the legislative decision) is 1/N. When the
</I>&gt;<i>     voting population numbers (N) in the millions or billions, this is
</I>&gt;<i>     a vanishingly small serving of political power. I see an attempt
</I>&gt;<i>     to increase the political power of the vote of each citizen from
</I>&gt;<i>     zero to 1/N as an attempt to give each citizen a bigger thimble
</I>&gt;<i>     with which to try to bail out this global Titanic that we are on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Analysis Topic 3: The Other Structural Fault
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; Nor could we claim (as I do) that the lack of that vote
</I>&gt;<i>     [carrying the full 1/N political power] is the root cause of
</I>&gt;<i>     political bondage, economic injustice and other widespread human
</I>&gt;<i>     rights violations [and war, poverty, biosphere degradation,
</I>&gt;<i>     fleecing future generations, etc.].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; After a legislative decision is made (even through full-power
</I>&gt;<i>     1/N voting), the legislation is then handed over to hierarchs and
</I>&gt;<i>     capitalists and banksters for execution and adjudication. The
</I>&gt;<i>     governance systems of the hierarchs and the capitalists and
</I>&gt;<i>     banksters are not democratic: about the best that the general
</I>&gt;<i>     citizenry can do to try to affect those decisions is to stand out
</I>&gt;<i>     in the streets (in the freezing cold) waving signs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; In my view, trying to create a voting system that increases
</I>&gt;<i>     the political power of the vote of each citizen from zero to 1/N
</I>&gt;<i>     is like trying to fix a crack in the legislative sidewalk
</I>&gt;<i>     (structural fault #1) of Jiminy Cricket Land. At the end of that
</I>&gt;<i>     sidewalk (at the point that the legislation is passed) lies the
</I>&gt;<i>     Grand Canyon (structural fault #2). On the other side of that
</I>&gt;<i>     Grand Canyon lies the Land of the Hierarchs and Capitalists and
</I>&gt;<i>     Banksters to which the legislation is passed, where democracy and
</I>&gt;<i>     collaboration are not to be found, and where political bondage,
</I>&gt;<i>     economic injustice, widespread human rights violations, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>     flourish -- it is the land where we all actually live, when we are
</I>&gt;<i>     not in Jiminy Cricket Land voting to generate better quality
</I>&gt;<i>     legislation for the hierarchs and capitalists and banksters to ignore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; In order for collaborative governance to be able to actually
</I>&gt;<i>     produce good governance outcomes in the real world, the
</I>&gt;<i>     collaborative governance system must be capable of rendering
</I>&gt;<i>     hierarchies and capitalism and parasitic banking obsolete, which
</I>&gt;<i>     means that the system must be capable of making all of the
</I>&gt;<i>     governance decisions that hierarchs and capitalists and banksters
</I>&gt;<i>     now make, more effectively and efficiently than hierarchs and
</I>&gt;<i>     capitalists and banksters now make those decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; To me it seems that resolving structural fault #1 without
</I>&gt;<i>     resolving structural fault #2 would be an empty gesture. And, any
</I>&gt;<i>     collaborative governance system that was capable of resolving
</I>&gt;<i>     structural fault #2 would almost certainly also be capable of
</I>&gt;<i>     resolving structural fault #1 as well. For both those reasons, I
</I>&gt;<i>     would suggest that we should be focusing on conceiving and
</I>&gt;<i>     creating a collaborative governance system capable of resolving
</I>&gt;<i>     structural fault #2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Analysis Topic 4: The &quot;Just Do It!&quot; Approach
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; Would it [the full-power 1/N vote] really make a difference?
</I>&gt;<i>     I say yes, you say no, but really nobody knows because nobody ever
</I>&gt;<i>     tried it before. So we'll try it: we'll put a working ballot in
</I>&gt;<i>     the elector's hands and see what comes of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; There is indeed much to commend the &quot;Just Do It!&quot; approach. I
</I>&gt;<i>     wish you well with your experiment. (And also, we would all
</I>&gt;<i>     potentially be more effective in our quest to &quot;make things better&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     if we could collaboratively work through to conceiving an
</I>&gt;<i>     experiment that we would all be willing to collaborate on running
</I>&gt;<i>     together. Our efforts and resources could then be synergistically
</I>&gt;<i>     rather than dysergistically employed.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Analysis Topic 5: Diagnosing The Primary Root Problem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; What is the root cause in your own theory?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I see our primary root problem as being that some of the
</I>&gt;<i>     social arrangements we have now set up positive feedback loops
</I>&gt;<i>     that (over generations) steadily concentrate more and more wealth
</I>&gt;<i>     and power into fewer and fewer hands. These days, the three main
</I>&gt;<i>     social arrangement concentrators happen to be hierarchies,
</I>&gt;<i>     capitalism, and parasitic banking. In other times, other social
</I>&gt;<i>     arrangements have served to increasingly concentrate power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Analysis Topic 6: Solving The Primary Root Problem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; So long as we continue to be dependent on the decision making
</I>&gt;<i>     of hierarchs, capitalists, and banksters, we cannot remove them
</I>&gt;<i>     from power, nor render their roles and their systems obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i>     Therefore, we first need a fully operational collaborative
</I>&gt;<i>     governance *decision system* capable of making all of the
</I>&gt;<i>     decisions that hierarchs, capitalists, and banksters now make,
</I>&gt;<i>     more effectively and efficiently than they now make those decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; As with the &quot;working ballot experiment&quot;, the &quot;full
</I>&gt;<i>     collaborative governance experiment&quot; has never been run before,
</I>&gt;<i>     and has not until now even been possible -- the new governance
</I>&gt;<i>     systems will need to use technologies that are only now available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Analysis Topic 7: Experimental Validation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike: Is it [your proposed root problem, your proposed governance
</I>&gt;<i>     solution] open to experimental validation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I would say yes. *Any* proposed root problem diagnosis, and
</I>&gt;<i>     any proposed governance system solution can be experimentally
</I>&gt;<i>     validated (at least indirectly). Governance systems produce
</I>&gt;<i>     governance outcomes (war, poverty, biosphere degradation, etc. on
</I>&gt;<i>     the &quot;bad&quot; side, citizens thriving and such on the &quot;good&quot; side)
</I>&gt;<i>     that are objectively observable and measurable phenomena. To
</I>&gt;<i>     determine whether a proposed problem diagnosis is valid, and
</I>&gt;<i>     whether a proposed solution does effectively resolve the problem,
</I>&gt;<i>     one would measure and track the governance *outcomes* produced by
</I>&gt;<i>     the decisions of the governance system. For example, if the
</I>&gt;<i>     diagnosis were that concentrated power is the root cause of wars,
</I>&gt;<i>     and the proposed governance system then leads to no more wars,
</I>&gt;<i>     that would constitute evidence (however fuzzy and disputable) that
</I>&gt;<i>     the diagnosis and solution were valid.
