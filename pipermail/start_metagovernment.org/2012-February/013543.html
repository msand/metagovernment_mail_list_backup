<PRE>Simplification - what you say is, that architects are not needed. There is
no design issue, its just a matter of rationality. So architects like
Santiago Calatrava schould not be popular.
On the other hand, what you say is that whether houses should be build or
not is an opinion issue only. That's true if someone can afford the money -
that means in such a setting - he has accumulated &quot;votes&quot; (that is money)
that he may spent - that means he has the right to &quot;command&quot; people to
build a house for him. So in a sense, money is like voting, where not
everyone has the same amount of votes, but the amount of votes to let
things be executed by others depends on the amount one has accumulated
(money).

But there is also rules, whether some demands should or could be fullfilled
or not. Some demands cannot be fullfiled, like a house that flies and can
warp to other locations. Maybe there is high demand and there are not
enough companys to build what is needed, or maybe there are many homeles
people - should houses be build for all of them? how much work force or
ressources could the nation afford to fullfill this demand? Is it clever to
do so? Could the ressources be spent in other ways? what other issues are
there? what priorities do they have? ...you could use the scientific method
to figure it out.

So if you look close enough, everything is about opinion and the same time,
it's about using the scientific method.

The pirate party in germany decided to differentiate three kinds of
systems: 1.information system, 2.opinion finding/searching/building 3.
execution system
I dont know if that approach is the best approach and probably these
systems should be entangeled closely with each other to a point where it
becomes impossible to differentiate between those three, but maybe its a
good way to start and to learn or to be inspired of how to move forward.

And the scientific method? you mean citing? who decided on what is worth
citing and what not? thats opinion based.
Or is it about stating and analyzing arguments? ...its only possible if
there are assumptions about reality and maybe in your chain of arguments
you end up with something like gravity - i mean, in my opinion, gravity is
a pretty strong argument, but maybe not everyone would agree. would you
force those to agree? or would you just hope that most people would agree
on a chain of arguments thats based upon gravity? :-)

By the way, many people are not used to write very disciplined, so even if
tools are opinion based, there could be mechanisms that teach and support
the &quot;right&quot; way (maybe the scientific way) of expressing yourself - and
over time - people will get used to it, if they think it makes life easier
and discussions less painful.

</I>&gt;<i> The problem as you see it is: (A) political decisions are based on the
</I>&gt;<i> opinion of the few, which (B) is a poor basis for political decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What if political decisions were instead based on the opinion of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  A. Political decisions are based on opinion -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   B. Opinion is a poor basis for political
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisions - yes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If so, what is your evidence for A?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As we know all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political decisions are made by hands of the few. They are so called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; politicians. Their opinions are political decisions. In democracy, we
</I>&gt;<i> have just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; illusion of control.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Evidence for political
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisions are based on opinion &#8211; How much money state print, foreign
</I>&gt;<i> policy,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; State security, education , transportation etc. are all based on
</I>&gt;<i> opinions. All
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political decisions are made by hand of the few politicians opinions.
</I>&gt;<i> Our resources,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security, environment etc. manage by few people&#8217;s opinions. We called
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system politics.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Politics
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think politic is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; byproduct of two phenomenons.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Statism &#8211; Use of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; state power to achieve goals is politics. Who is having the state power?
</I>&gt;<i> As we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everybody knows hands of the few. Why it is on the hand of few? Because
</I>&gt;<i> it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; establish intuition to maintain the power of few. How the state
</I>&gt;<i> established?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; State arises as a result competing slave ownership. A large tribe with a
</I>&gt;<i> slave
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; owner is called country. In fact present day country is a tribe with a
</I>&gt;<i> flag and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anthem. State use our group behavior to accomplish state goal that
</I>&gt;<i> maintain the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; establish intuitions on the expense of human freedom and development.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Failure of economics
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#8211; Economics is household management in Greek term. Historically we
</I>&gt;<i> agricultural
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; humans had scarcity on supply of the products. That maintains the price
</I>&gt;<i> base
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; economics such as capitalism, communism, socialism or fascism. However we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; industrial humans obtain the technological capacity to produce more than
</I>&gt;<i> we consume.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So growth and scarcity no longer exist to maintain the price of product,
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; establish political institutions, banks and co operations want
</I>&gt;<i> artificially
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; create scarcity and growth to maintain price structure. Politics is a
</I>&gt;<i> byproduct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of fail economics. When people&#8217;s needs are meet exchange, money,
</I>&gt;<i> politics are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; obsolete. Educated people need no control. Even we need control we can
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that control with minimum human opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I understand not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only opinion is poor basis politics, politics itself limit our freedom
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unnecessary phenomena for advance economic model such as resource based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; economy. So I hope direct democracy can break the power of establish
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; institutions and people will have collective freedom to obtain resource
</I>&gt;<i> based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; economy that politics and opinions are irrelevant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope you will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand my view. If not please ask any questions. I will explain as
</I>&gt;<i> much I can.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you very much

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Russel,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Before looking at your proposed solution, I want to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem as you see it.  Is it the following?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   A. Political decisions are based on opinion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   B. Opinion is a poor basis for political decisions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If so, what is your evidence for A?
