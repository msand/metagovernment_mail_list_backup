<PRE>&#160;Hi Michael,&#160;
&#160;A. Political decisions are based on opinion -
yes
&#160; B. Opinion is a poor basis for political
decisions - yes

If so, what is your evidence for A?
As we know all
political decisions are made by hands of the few. They are so called
politicians. Their opinions are political decisions. In democracy, we have just
illusion of control. 
Evidence for political
decisions are based on opinion &#8211; How much money state print, foreign policy,
State security, education , transportation etc. are all based on opinions. All
political decisions are made by hand of the few politicians opinions. Our resources,
security, environment etc. manage by few people&#8217;s opinions. We called that
system politics.&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;
Politics
I think politic is a
byproduct of two phenomenons.
1. Statism &#8211; Use of the
state power to achieve goals is politics. Who is having the state power? As we
everybody knows hands of the few. Why it is on the hand of few? Because it is
establish intuition to maintain the power of few. How the state established?
State arises as a result competing slave ownership. A large tribe with a slave
owner is called country. In fact present day country is a tribe with a flag and
anthem. State use our group behavior to accomplish state goal that maintain the
establish intuitions on the expense of human freedom and development. 
2. Failure of economics
&#8211; Economics is household management in Greek term. Historically we agricultural
humans had scarcity on supply of the products. That maintains the price base
economics such as capitalism, communism, socialism or fascism. However we
industrial humans obtain the technological capacity to produce more than we consume.
So growth and scarcity no longer exist to maintain the price of product, but
establish political institutions, banks and co operations want artificially
create scarcity and growth to maintain price structure. Politics is a byproduct
of fail economics. When people&#8217;s needs are meet exchange, money, politics are
obsolete. Educated people need no control. Even we need control we can have
that control with minimum human opinion.&#160; &#160;&#160;
As I understand not
only opinion is poor basis politics, politics itself limit our freedom and
unnecessary phenomena for advance economic model such as resource based
economy. So I hope direct democracy can break the power of establish
institutions and people will have collective freedom to obtain resource based
economy that politics and opinions are irrelevant.&#160; 
I hope you will
understand my view. If not please ask any questions. I will explain as much I can. 
Thank
you very much
Russel

Hi Russel,

Before looking at your proposed solution, I want to understand the
problem as you see it.&#160; Is it the following?

&#160; A. Political decisions are based on opinion
&#160; B. Opinion is a poor basis for political decisions

If so, what is your evidence for A?

</I>&gt;<i> My thinking is
</I>&gt;<i> transition from plutocratic capitalist political system to more humane resource
