<PRE>Hello

I am Amir Kolahchi, Software Engineer, Iranian,
from Netherlands. I&#8217;ve prepared a Proposal for launching an Institute-Website for
promoting Democracy in Iran. The Institute will work more in the field of Introducing
the Parties, Surveying and Polling. 
The Information that will be published through
the website, is for polling from 3 categories: &#160;General Public, Parties and Experts. In fact,
the main basis of the proposal is the following:
&#160;
One: Declaring the clear and the accurate
positions and Opinions by Parties about Policies for Iran&#8217;s ideal governmence, such
as:
Constitution
Governence Framework 
Economic 
Social 
Cultural and&#160;Religius 
Scientific&#160;and&#160;Artistic
Military and Security Policies
&#160;
Two: Polling based on these declared opinions.
&#160;
Some Moduels of the Proposal are:
1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Constitution&#8217;s
Editor&#8221; that is provided to Parties and faciliates documanting the Constitution.
2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;User Match
Test&#8221; with the declared positions of the Parties
3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Per Day
Question Poll&#8221;
4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;Constitution
Poll&#8221;
5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Poll Tracker
6.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ...
As you may know, there is not any Institute to
provide such services to Iranians and I made sure about that after consultation
with some expert.
Success Factor of the Proposal is in participation
and involvement of the whole Iranian Parties and groups and undoubtedly it will
not happen without cooperation and association of Political Parties and International
Institutes and Organizations.

For this reason, I intend to introduce the
Plan to you in addition to get consults in order to better implimentation.
Business Plan and Strategic Plan is prepared
and I can sent it to you if interested.
For reviewing the Business Model and more
information please use these links:&#160;

and Information are in Persian.
&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For graphical
representation and better understanding, as well as specifying the activity
field, I used a prestigious Website in this field.
&#160;
If possible&#160;please&#160;tell me&#160;what
is&#160;your opinion&#160;about&#160;this&#160;plan?
What kind of Professional, Technological or
other kind of assistance is possible for your organization?
&#160;
Best Regards,
Amir Kolahchi
