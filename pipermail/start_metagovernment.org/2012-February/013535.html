I can explain if you like.  Basically we'll give each elector a ballot
(strike at the root) and see if it enables communicative action, which
is a kind of tongue power.  Voting in itself might be worthless by
some estimations, but not communicative action.  All we need to
understand is the connection between the two.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; What is the root cause in your own theory?  Is it open to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experimental validation?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see our primary root problem as being that some of the social
</I>&gt;<i> arrangements we have now set up positive feedback loops that (over
</I>&gt;<i> generations) steadily concentrate more and more wealth and power
</I>&gt;<i> into fewer and fewer hands. These days, the three main social
</I>&gt;<i> arrangement concentrators happen to be hierarchies, capitalism, and
</I>&gt;<i> parasitic banking. In other times, other social arrangements have
</I>&gt;<i> served to increasingly concentrate power.
</I>
You see three root causes.  Should we understand the combination of
all three *together* to be the cause, or is each alone sufficient
cause in itself?

Might there be a fourth cause?  What is the rationale of inclusion?
People might want to add their favourite scapegoats to the list.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Analysis Topic 1: Vote Power OR Proposal Power
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The &quot;tongue power&quot; I was referring to (I thought I was following 
</I>&gt;<i> your usage ...) is that of **giving reasons** for preferring one 
</I>&gt;<i> alternative over another. From the &quot;tongue power&quot; perspective, a vote is 
</I>&gt;<i> just a grunt -- a gesture. Beyond merely expressing preference, it is 
</I>&gt;<i> not usefully communicative -- it expresses no **reasons** for the choice 
</I>&gt;<i> made.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In order to have collaborative governance, the **reasons** for 
</I>&gt;<i> preferences must be given. When I present a thesis that you don't find 
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable for various reasons, the most efficient and effective way to 
</I>&gt;<i> proceed is for you to articulate an **analysis** (analytically break out 
</I>&gt;<i> the parts you find problematic, and articulate the perspectives from 
</I>&gt;<i> which you see problems) and then propose **antitheses** (for each part, 
</I>&gt;<i> from each perspective, give the **reasons** that you find the part 
</I>&gt;<i> problematic). That then gives the two of us (and others who wish to be 
</I>&gt;<i> involved) the necessary information to be able to seek a synthesis that 
</I>&gt;<i> satisfies everyone. A sketch of the full recursive synthesis process 
</I>&gt;<i> might be [thesis &gt; analysis &gt; antitheses &gt; ... (recursive drilling down) 
</I>&gt;<i> ... &gt; syntheses &gt; synthesis].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; As is done in Votorola, you could present an alternative thesis (or 
</I>&gt;<i> thesis fragment -- recombinant text) without articulating any analyses 
</I>&gt;<i> or antitheses, but that would leave me (and others) having to guess 
</I>&gt;<i> about **why** you prefer your thesis to mine. This would greatly hamper 
</I>&gt;<i> attempts by myself and others to come up with a synthesis that might 
</I>&gt;<i> satisfy us all. To get from thesis to synthesis most effectively and 
</I>&gt;<i> efficiently, it is highly helpful to go through analysis and antithesis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Using voting as a decision mechanism short-circuits this recursive 
</I>&gt;<i> synthesis process of communicating **reasons**. My suggestion is that we 
</I>&gt;<i> abandon voting entirely, and instead create a decision system that uses 
</I>&gt;<i> **proposing** (proposal = preference + reasons) as the decision 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism. That is what I meant when I said &quot;I am a really big fan of 
</I>&gt;<i> tongue power -- I think that that's the way we should go.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Analysis Topic 2: The Political Power of a Vote
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; If all votes are weighted equally, then the **maximum** relative 
</I>&gt;<i> political power that each vote can have (in terms of its formal effect 
</I>&gt;<i> in making the legislative decision) is 1/N. When the voting population 
</I>&gt;<i> numbers (N) in the millions or billions, this is a vanishingly small 
</I>&gt;<i> serving of political power. I see an attempt to increase the political 
</I>&gt;<i> power of the vote of each citizen from zero to 1/N as an attempt to give 
</I>&gt;<i> each citizen a bigger thimble with which to try to bail out this global 
</I>&gt;<i> Titanic that we are on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Analysis Topic 3: The Other Structural Fault
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mike&gt; Nor could we claim (as I do) that the lack of that vote [carrying 
</I>&gt;<i> the full 1/N political power] is the root cause of political bondage, 
</I>&gt;<i> economic injustice and other widespread human rights violations [and 
</I>&gt;<i> war, poverty, biosphere degradation, fleecing future generations, etc.].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; After a legislative decision is made (even through full-power 1/N 
</I>&gt;<i> voting), the legislation is then handed over to hierarchs and 
</I>&gt;<i> capitalists and banksters for execution and adjudication. The governance 
</I>&gt;<i> systems of the hierarchs and the capitalists and banksters are not 
</I>&gt;<i> democratic: about the best that the general citizenry can do to try to 
</I>&gt;<i> affect those decisions is to stand out in the streets (in the freezing 
</I>&gt;<i> cold) waving signs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In my view, trying to create a voting system that increases the 
</I>&gt;<i> political power of the vote of each citizen from zero to 1/N is like 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to fix a crack in the legislative sidewalk (structural fault #1) 
</I>&gt;<i> of Jiminy Cricket Land. At the end of that sidewalk (at the point that 
</I>&gt;<i> the legislation is passed) lies the Grand Canyon (structural fault #2). 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other side of that Grand Canyon lies the Land of the Hierarchs 
</I>&gt;<i> and Capitalists and Banksters to which the legislation is passed, where 
</I>&gt;<i> democracy and collaboration are not to be found, and where political 
</I>&gt;<i> bondage, economic injustice, widespread human rights violations, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> flourish -- it is the land where we all actually live, when we are not 
</I>&gt;<i> in Jiminy Cricket Land voting to generate better quality legislation for 
</I>&gt;<i> the hierarchs and capitalists and banksters to ignore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In order for collaborative governance to be able to actually 
</I>&gt;<i> produce good governance outcomes in the real world, the collaborative 
</I>&gt;<i> governance system must be capable of rendering hierarchies and 
</I>&gt;<i> capitalism and parasitic banking obsolete, which means that the system 
</I>&gt;<i> must be capable of making all of the governance decisions that hierarchs 
</I>&gt;<i> and capitalists and banksters now make, more effectively and efficiently 
</I>&gt;<i> than hierarchs and capitalists and banksters now make those decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; To me it seems that resolving structural fault #1 without resolving 
</I>&gt;<i> structural fault #2 would be an empty gesture. And, any collaborative 
</I>&gt;<i> governance system that was capable of resolving structural fault #2 
</I>&gt;<i> would almost certainly also be capable of resolving structural fault #1 
</I>&gt;<i> as well. For both those reasons, I would suggest that we should be 
</I>&gt;<i> focusing on conceiving and creating a collaborative governance system 
</I>&gt;<i> capable of resolving structural fault #2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Analysis Topic 4: The &quot;Just Do It!&quot; Approach
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mike&gt; Would it [the full-power 1/N vote] really make a difference? I say 
</I>&gt;<i> yes, you say no, but really nobody knows because nobody ever tried it 
</I>&gt;<i> before. So we'll try it: we'll put a working ballot in the elector's 
</I>&gt;<i> hands and see what comes of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; There is indeed much to commend the &quot;Just Do It!&quot; approach. I wish 
</I>&gt;<i> you well with your experiment. (And also, we would all potentially be 
</I>&gt;<i> more effective in our quest to &quot;make things better&quot; if we could 
</I>&gt;<i> collaboratively work through to conceiving an experiment that we would 
</I>&gt;<i> all be willing to collaborate on running together. Our efforts and 
</I>&gt;<i> resources could then be synergistically rather than dysergistically 
</I>&gt;<i> employed.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Analysis Topic 5: Diagnosing The Primary Root Problem
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mike&gt; What is the root cause in your own theory?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I see our primary root problem as being that some of the social 
</I>&gt;<i> arrangements we have now set up positive feedback loops that (over 
</I>&gt;<i> generations) steadily concentrate more and more wealth and power into 
</I>&gt;<i> fewer and fewer hands. These days, the three main social arrangement 
</I>&gt;<i> concentrators happen to be hierarchies, capitalism, and parasitic 
</I>&gt;<i> banking. In other times, other social arrangements have served to 
</I>&gt;<i> increasingly concentrate power.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Analysis Topic 6: Solving The Primary Root Problem
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; So long as we continue to be dependent on the decision making of 
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchs, capitalists, and banksters, we cannot remove them from power, 
</I>&gt;<i> nor render their roles and their systems obsolete. Therefore, we first 
</I>&gt;<i> need a fully operational collaborative governance *decision system* 
</I>&gt;<i> capable of making all of the decisions that hierarchs, capitalists, and 
</I>&gt;<i> banksters now make, more effectively and efficiently than they now make 
</I>&gt;<i> those decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; As with the &quot;working ballot experiment&quot;, the &quot;full collaborative 
</I>&gt;<i> governance experiment&quot; has never been run before, and has not until now 
</I>&gt;<i> even been possible -- the new governance systems will need to use 
</I>&gt;<i> technologies that are only now available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Analysis Topic 7: Experimental Validation
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mike: Is it [your proposed root problem, your proposed governance 
</I>&gt;<i> solution] open to experimental validation?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I would say yes. *Any* proposed root problem diagnosis, and any 
</I>&gt;<i> proposed governance system solution can be experimentally validated (at 
</I>&gt;<i> least indirectly). Governance systems produce governance outcomes (war, 
</I>&gt;<i> poverty, biosphere degradation, etc. on the &quot;bad&quot; side, citizens 
</I>&gt;<i> thriving and such on the &quot;good&quot; side) that are objectively observable 
</I>&gt;<i> and measurable phenomena. To determine whether a proposed problem 
</I>&gt;<i> diagnosis is valid, and whether a proposed solution does effectively 
</I>&gt;<i> resolve the problem, one would measure and track the governance 
</I>&gt;<i> *outcomes* produced by the decisions of the governance system. For 
</I>&gt;<i> example, if the diagnosis were that concentrated power is the root cause 
</I>&gt;<i> of wars, and the proposed governance system then leads to no more wars, 
</I>&gt;<i> that would constitute evidence (however fuzzy and disputable) that the 
</I>&gt;<i> diagnosis and solution were valid.
