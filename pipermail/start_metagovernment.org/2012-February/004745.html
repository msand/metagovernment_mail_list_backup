<PRE>Hi,
I don&#8217;t know whether
you heard about resource based economic model that used scientific method to
arrive at decision instead of human opinion. However present world we have to
use human opinion for decision making process because we are so familiar with
opinion based decision making process, but gradual introduction scientific
method of decision making process to replace the human opinion based decision
making process will lead to have more accurate and fair resolutions. Even in
classical resource based economic model human opinion may relevant for some
extend for advance research programs. We cannot use scientific method in
current representative democratic system because that will lead to
dictatorship. Therefore we must have participatory democracy, before even think
about resource based economy. 
My thinking is
transition from plutocratic capitalist political system to more humane resource
based economy that not use money can be done through digital direct democratic
platform.&#160; 
First let the people
decide what kind of challenges get opinion base decision making process and
which challenges are arrive at decision by scientific method. For example
foreign policy, security must need a human opinion based decision making
process. However food, water, transportation and housing can be managed by
intelligent resource management through scientific method with minimal human
opinion. 
Scientific method of
social concern:
&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; State the problem- Recognizing a new
idea or problem that needs to be resolved.
&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Gather information- The use of logical
reasoning to create a hypothesis, considering all information available. 
&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Test the hypothesis in the physical
world through observation and state the conclusion. &#160;
Human
opinion is biased, irrational and sometime no common sense. On the other hand
scientific method is easy, no biases at all and logical conclusion can be
achieved very effective and efficient manner. The main advantage that adding
the scientific method on direct democracy is majority of the issues can be
resolved by simple scientific method software platform. As a result it does
reduce the complexity of direct democracy process. Most of human challenges are
technical. So scientific method is the best tool to resolve our problems. 
Governance
= Direct Democracy + Liquid Democracy + Scientific Method
Please
feel free to ask any question on this regard.
