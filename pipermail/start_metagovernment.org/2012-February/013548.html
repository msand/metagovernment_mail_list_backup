<PRE>By the way - is building weapons - even when it's done automatically -
energy efficient?
Isn't doing nothing the most &quot;energy efficient method&quot;?
Isn't war something that consumes a lot of energy?

In pure theory, what are weapons good for? It's to protect something.... i
think. So what exactly is it that you want to protect? From what?

And about energy efficiency: Isn't the most unefficient way of doing
something the most energy efficient way to do exactly that?
Whats the criterion for optimizing &quot;energy efficiency&quot; ? - if it's not
&quot;fun&quot;, &quot;joy&quot; or any similar concept however that concept is exactly defined

</I>&gt;<i> dont work anymore? more forcing? more commanding?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So eventually after a lot of forcing and commanding to do the right
</I>&gt;<i> things, you end up with a fully automated economy ... what should it
</I>&gt;<i> produce? the same house, over and over again? how do you decide what is
</I>&gt;<i> fancy and what not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way: &quot;  I will not have irrational desire to have fancy staff.  &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sex is fancy, isnt it? Dressing &quot;hot&quot; is fancy - think about all the
</I>&gt;<i> clothes you have to buy and stuff you have to do to seduce someone.... why
</I>&gt;<i> not choose the perfect partner from genetic code, let one masturbate and
</I>&gt;<i> transmit it to the place in the world where that perfect partner sits... so
</I>&gt;<i> you can save the cost to fly over there.... why do football? why do
</I>&gt;<i> dancing? why listen to music? why singing songs? why making jokes? - its
</I>&gt;<i> all energy inefficient stuff, isnt it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it's not and some day we will decode what it is useful for, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> some scientific disciplines have already done so and you can fit together
</I>&gt;<i> the parts of the puzzle... but at least the fit puzzle - if it exists (i
</I>&gt;<i> doubt it) is not mainstream yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the place of humans in that model you describe? what will they do?
</I>&gt;<i> there might be no work left - maybe only a handful of experts are needed
</I>&gt;<i> and what there task is might be perfectly calculatable :-) ...so the more
</I>&gt;<i> advanced your proposed concept becomes, the less experts are needed,
</I>&gt;<i> because eventually the semantic web can decide everything and learn on its
</I>&gt;<i> own and eventually it can build robots for all kinds of purposes to do
</I>&gt;<i> stuff - in your vision, there seems to be no place for humans at all :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you dont seem to go for kybernetically enhanced humans that love to play -

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inaccessibility due to patents.    ****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Before I explain housing building challenge I should explain resource

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Resource Based Economy:****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#183;         Resource Accounting****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#183;         Dynamic equilibrium****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#183;         Strategic design( technological efficiency)****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Particular region must calculate their resources, use the dynamic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> equilibrium for resource management for example production of wood must
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relate to planting of trees. Products must produce collaborative way with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best technology we can use in this moment. ****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a central planning system. Interdisciplinary team (experts)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involve for planning the cities, industries and farming. Demand or opinion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> influenced by resource of the region and technology of the region. Other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way to demand is fulfilled with access abundance system. Instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> property based system we should have access based system, for example
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead of own a car we have access to cars at any time. Once we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access to houses and build according to resource base economic model then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our opinion is not use as an infinite demander, as a participant on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system, because we know our limitation of resources and technologies. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think this is a true participatory democracy. For produce the stuffs of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> course we will use scientific method. Our opinion and interdisciplinary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> team opinion are subject to resources, dynamic equilibrium and technologies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thus voting to produce stuff will be more rational and unbiased. Access
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abundance may lead to the property ownership obsolete.  ****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Simplification- Design everything collaborative democratic manner with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resource base economic model--- Produce the stuffs according to scientific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> method------ access abundance.  ****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we have advance super computer, then we can design software for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resource accounting, dynamic equilibrium, strategic design with that super
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computer to produce best stuffs with minimum human opinion and less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interdisciplinary team involvement. Actually United States military has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such a system to produce weapons that not use human opinion.     ****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Only thing that we have to develop software to unite people, industries
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and professionals that come together to allocate one place to develop a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prototype city then rest of people can follow. I think direct democratic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software can play crucial role to overcome this challenge. ****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let me explain housing building in resource based economy. I have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inform interdisciplinary and central computer that I need a house at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular region. Since it is not my property and it is an access based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> method I will not have irrational desire to have fancy staff. The house is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going to build according to resource based economic model thus I already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know what resources utilize for build the houses and technological
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parameters. So my opinion is reconciled with experts and supercomputer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However in monetary system how we can ever accept experts plan that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don&#8217;t have any idea of resources and technologies. More over manipulate the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> masses by the advertising lead to over consumption of the finite resources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think opinion of the people and expert&#8217;s opinion are never going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reconcile in the monetary system.     ****
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is why I advocate participation of the people to understand and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> educate by themselves to restriction of the resources and technologies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then they will have self control and satisfaction that driven by knowledge.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The participation of people on decision making process would lead to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> psychological tendency that they are not under control by some authority.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So participation of the people is not a problem, it is a solution. It is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessity until them confident over that system.     ****

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Could be, they dont like the color
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Could be, because they want to use the building in a way that was not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anticipated by the experts (a requirement that was not expressed in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first place)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Could be, because people have habits (structure in mind or body (like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> muscle memory) that built over time) and they know its too much change to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anticipate the &quot;new ways&quot; of doing/living - so they might need smaller
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increments
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. It could be, because they don't see or comprehend how they could do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the stuff that they did in the past with the new design.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5. Could be, that cooking in the kitchen was of intrinsic value for some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people, they enjoyed cooking food, and maybe the new approach uses a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replicator like the one used in Star Trek - and they hate it to not be able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to do their hobby, or maybe they FEAR that they are not needed anymore and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dont see how they will fit into the new way of doing things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...its lot of potential issues - and everyone has a subjective view on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the topic, so who knows if experts do not miss a perspective or maybe there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are conflicting perspectives and experts need to make trade offs, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is no technology known yet that could solve the issue with a win-win
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situation, or maybe in an actual situation there is no one imaginative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough to find that solution...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So in essence it SCIENCE vs ART - Is programming ART? Or is it SCIENCE?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...is XY an ART or is it SCIENCE?? - where there is room for Art and there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> normaly is if the issue is not trivial, - and with enough subjective

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ... However building the houses is a technical issue that needs

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; have to use scientific method as a primary method to resolve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; problem. Direct democracy should consider if people are well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; informed and educated on this issue. ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When it comes to deciding *how* to build the housing, the opinion of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the people who are affected might *not* matter, or it might matter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *less*, or in some qualified way.  I want to understand exactly what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you mean here.  Please consider this situation:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  (1) The people who live in a community all agree that housing is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      top priority for the infrastructure budget.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  (2) A detailed plan is drafted by experts.  The experts agree it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      a good plan.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  (3) The people who live in the community do not like the plan.  They
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      agree it is a bad plan.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ought the plan (2) to be executed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ... If people don&#8217;t have knowledge but still they want to involve,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; then they can use liquid democracy. For example energy production is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; highly technical issue that can use scientific method, if the people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; have knowledge about energy production and then they can participate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; directly and the people who don&#8217;t have knowledge can use liquid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; democracy. In reality people don&#8217;t have knowledge about such highly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; technical issues but we should have a software program that anybody
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; can participate on the issue as a matter of pure democratic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; principle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You see liquid democracy (transitive delegation) as a solution to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem, or part of a solution.  But before talking about the possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solutions, we need a better understanding of the problem.  We wished
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> away the problematic fact of decisions being made by the opinion of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the few and are now in a counterfactual situation where we confront
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the opinion of the many (3).  In this new situation, what exactly is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the problem we face?
