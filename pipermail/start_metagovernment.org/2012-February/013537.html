<PRE>hi Amir,

I am a member of democracy international  <A HREF="http://www.democracy-international.org/">http://www.democracy-international.org/</A>  wich may be of interest to you. (e-book for free download on <A HREF="http://www.democracy-international.org/book-direct-democracy.html">http://www.democracy-international.org/book-direct-democracy.html</A> in 8 languages)
On the other hand we have bad experiences with political parties and their involvement in direct democracy. They are interested in so far that it not endangers their position to decide and at best they want to launch referenda when it suits them (this system of government induced referenda is prohibited by law in Switzerland). 
That is why we were very interested in the Demoex experiment in Vallentuna, a suburb of Stockholm (Sweden ) who got an elected representative in 2002.
They forced entry in a representative system with a direct democratic initiative.
All over the world similar initiatives are starting and recently they start to work together on E2D. <A HREF="http://e2d-international.org/">http://e2d-international.org/</A>
In very short:

-in public office elected members of  Parties, members of E2D, will vote 
accordingly to the decision of the citizens in the circumscription involved (on a dedicated website).
- The party will not have or develop a &quot;program&quot;. Citizens can induce 
initiatives who result in a proposal of law submitted by the elected 
representative(s) or vote in referendums on laws or propositions, proposed 
by politicians, if they want to do so.

Options: (not limited) - Liquid Democracy, secret voting, use of Electronic 
Identity card, end to end auditable voting system (Helios) , forum discussions, 
possiblity to propose amendments, counter proposals,...

There are websites who provide the possibility for citizens to express their views but it is very frustrating if they are only consultative at best. Make it possible to let decide the people themselves if they want to (if the people want they can  work with liquid democracy that allows delegation, but delegation can be redrawn at any moment ), it can be done now.

We (from E2D) gave a workshop on the ENA conference in Freiburg last year, ppt presentations, preparations and report are available on <A HREF="http://www.e2d-i.net/">http://www.e2d-i.net/</A> (forum is closed and transferred to the E2D forum)

Anyway, I try to make time to read your plans, they may be of help to all of us.


Kind regards and success with the organisation.

Subject: [MG] Forming a poll Institute-Website for Iranian groups &amp;parties's reconciliation

Hello

I am Amir Kolahchi, Software Engineer, Iranian, from Netherlands. I&#8217;ve prepared a Proposal for launching an Institute-Website for promoting Democracy in Iran. The Institute will work more in the field of Introducing the Parties, Surveying and Polling. 
The Information that will be published through the website, is for polling from 3 categories:  General Public, Parties and Experts. In fact, the main basis of the proposal is the following:

One: Declaring the clear and the accurate positions and Opinions by Parties about Policies for Iran&#8217;s ideal governmence, such as:
Constitution
Governence Framework 
Economic 
Social 
Cultural and Religius 
Scientific and Artistic
Military and Security Policies

Two: Polling based on these declared opinions.

Some Moduels of the Proposal are:
1.       &#8220;Constitution&#8217;s Editor&#8221; that is provided to Parties and faciliates documanting the Constitution.
2.       &#8220;User Match Test&#8221; with the declared positions of the Parties
3.       &#8220;Per Day Question Poll&#8221;
4.       &#8220;Constitution Poll&#8221;
5.       Poll Tracker
6.       ...
As you may know, there is not any Institute to provide such services to Iranians and I made sure about that after consultation with some expert.
Success Factor of the Proposal is in participation and involvement of the whole Iranian Parties and groups and undoubtedly it will not happen without cooperation and association of Political Parties and International Institutes and Organizations.

For this reason, I intend to introduce the Plan to you in addition to get consults in order to better implimentation.
Business Plan and Strategic Plan is prepared and I can sent it to you if interested.
For reviewing the Business Model and more information please use these links:

&#183;         Screen-shots and Information are in Persian.
&#183;         For graphical representation and better understanding, as well as specifying the activity field, I used a prestigious Website in this field.

If possible please tell me what is your opinion about this plan?
What kind of Professional, Technological or other kind of assistance is possible for your organization?

Best Regards,
Amir Kolahchi
