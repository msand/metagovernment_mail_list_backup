<PRE>No - you are wrong!

The current system creates money from debt - alternatives are possible
1.  <A HREF="http://www.positivemoney.org.uk/">http://www.positivemoney.org.uk/</A> (and countless others - where money is
put into the economy through the state, without debt, or through the
citizens)
My personal favourite - to bad it uses german language - but i can
translate if you are interested:  <A HREF="http://titanpad.com/ecbsystem">http://titanpad.com/ecbsystem</A> )

2. It's not the problem that money is created from debt, also it's not nice
- in theory it could work without the expoential function doing its work.
If you don't believe that, i can give you a small example where you can see
that - or i give it to you right away - but its an automatic google
translation so if its not understandable - tell me and i will manually
translate it ( <A HREF="http://titanpad.com/example">http://titanpad.com/example</A> )

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Alex and Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Main Problems &#8211; Money,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infinite material desire that generate by monetary system, lack of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understanding about resources management and technology inaccessibility
</I>&gt;<i> due to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patents.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Before I explain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; housing building challenge I should explain resource based economy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Resource Based Economy:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183;         Resource Accounting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183;         Dynamic equilibrium
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#183;         Strategic design( technological
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; efficiency)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Particular region must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calculate their resources, use the dynamic equilibrium for resource
</I>&gt;<i> management
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for example production of wood must relate to planting of trees.
</I>&gt;<i> Products must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; produce collaborative way with best technology we can use in this
</I>&gt;<i> moment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a central
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; planning system. Interdisciplinary team (experts) involve for planning
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cities, industries and farming. Demand or opinion influenced by resource
</I>&gt;<i> of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; region and technology of the region. Other way to demand is fulfilled
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access abundance system. Instead of property based system we should have
</I>&gt;<i> access
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; based system, for example instead of own a car we have access to cars at
</I>&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time. Once we have access to houses and build according to resource base
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; economic model then our opinion is not use as an infinite demander, as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; participant on the system, because we know our limitation of resources
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technologies. I think this is a true participatory democracy. For
</I>&gt;<i> produce the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stuffs of course we will use scientific method. Our opinion and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interdisciplinary team opinion are subject to resources, dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> equilibrium
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and technologies thus voting to produce stuff will be more rational and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unbiased. Access abundance may lead to the property ownership obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Simplification- Design
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everything collaborative democratic manner with resource base economic
</I>&gt;<i> model---
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Produce the stuffs according to scientific method------ access
</I>&gt;<i> abundance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we have advance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; super computer, then we can design software for resource accounting,
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; equilibrium, strategic design with that super computer to produce best
</I>&gt;<i> stuffs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with minimum human opinion and less interdisciplinary team involvement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually United States military has such a system to produce weapons
</I>&gt;<i> that not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use human opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Only thing that we have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to develop software to unite people, industries and professionals that
</I>&gt;<i> come together
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to allocate one place to develop a prototype city then rest of people can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; follow. I think direct democratic software can play crucial role to
</I>&gt;<i> overcome
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this challenge.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me explain housing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; building in resource based economy. I have to inform interdisciplinary
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; central computer that I need a house at particular region. Since it is
</I>&gt;<i> not my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; property and it is an access based method I will not have irrational
</I>&gt;<i> desire to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have fancy staff. The house is going to build according to resource based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; economic model thus I already know what resources utilize for build the
</I>&gt;<i> houses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and technological parameters. So my opinion is reconciled with experts
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supercomputer. However in monetary system how we can ever accept experts
</I>&gt;<i> plan
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that we don&#8217;t have any idea of resources and technologies. More over
</I>&gt;<i> manipulate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the masses by the advertising lead to over consumption of the finite
</I>&gt;<i> resources.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think opinion of the people and expert&#8217;s opinion are never going
</I>&gt;<i> reconcile in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the monetary system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is why I advocate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; participation of the people to understand and educate by themselves to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; restriction of the resources and technologies. Then they will have self
</I>&gt;<i> control
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and satisfaction that driven by knowledge. The participation of people
</I>&gt;<i> on decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making process would lead to psychological tendency that they are not
</I>&gt;<i> under
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control by some authority. So participation of the people is not a
</I>&gt;<i> problem, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a solution. It is a necessity until them confident over that system.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the people do not like it, it is because of REASONS :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Could be, they dont like the color
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Could be, because they want to use the building in a way that was not
</I>&gt;<i> anticipated by the experts (a requirement that was not expressed in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Could be, because people have habits (structure in mind or body (like
</I>&gt;<i> muscle memory) that built over time) and they know its too much change to
</I>&gt;<i> anticipate the &quot;new ways&quot; of doing/living - so they might need smaller
</I>&gt;<i> increments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. It could be, because they don't see or comprehend how they could do
</I>&gt;<i> all the stuff that they did in the past with the new design.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5. Could be, that cooking in the kitchen was of intrinsic value for some
</I>&gt;<i> people, they enjoyed cooking food, and maybe the new approach uses a
</I>&gt;<i> replicator like the one used in Star Trek - and they hate it to not be able
</I>&gt;<i> to do their hobby, or maybe they FEAR that they are not needed anymore and
</I>&gt;<i> dont see how they will fit into the new way of doing things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...its lot of potential issues - and everyone has a subjective view on
</I>&gt;<i> the topic, so who knows if experts do not miss a perspective or maybe there
</I>&gt;<i> are conflicting perspectives and experts need to make trade offs, because
</I>&gt;<i> there is no technology known yet that could solve the issue with a win-win
</I>&gt;<i> situation, or maybe in an actual situation there is no one imaginative
</I>&gt;<i> enough to find that solution...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So in essence it SCIENCE vs ART - Is programming ART? Or is it SCIENCE?
</I>&gt;<i> ...is XY an ART or is it SCIENCE?? - where there is room for Art and there
</I>&gt;<i> normaly is if the issue is not trivial, - and with enough subjective
</I>&gt;<i> perspectives there will be many requirements and thus the issue wont be
</I>&gt;<i> trivial anymore and there will be always room for ART :-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; addressed. ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;So when it comes to deciding whether to build housing, the opinion of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;the people who are affected by that decision matters.  However:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; ... However building the houses is a technical issue that needs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; scientific method approach.  The issue needs only opinion base
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; resolution and then software has to consider both direct democracy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; and liquid democracy. For example security or foreign policies that

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; have to use scientific method as a primary method to resolve the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; problem. Direct democracy should consider if people are well
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; informed and educated on this issue. ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;When it comes to deciding *how* to build the housing, the opinion of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;the people who are affected might *not* matter, or it might matter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;*less*, or in some qualified way.  I want to understand exactly what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;you mean here.  Please consider this situation:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (1) The people who live in a community all agree that housing is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     top priority for the infrastructure budget.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (2) A detailed plan is drafted by experts.  The experts agree it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     a good plan.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (3) The people who live in the community do not like the plan.  They
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     agree it is a bad plan.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;Ought the plan (2) to be executed?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; ... If people don&#8217;t have knowledge but still they want to involve,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; then they can use liquid democracy. For example energy production is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; highly technical issue that can use scientific method, if the people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; have knowledge about energy production and then they can participate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; directly and the people who don&#8217;t have knowledge can use liquid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; democracy. In reality people don&#8217;t have knowledge about such highly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; technical issues but we should have a software program that anybody
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; can participate on the issue as a matter of pure democratic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; principle.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;You see liquid democracy (transitive delegation) as a solution to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;problem, or part of a solution.  But before talking about the possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;solutions, we need a better understanding of the problem.  We wished
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;away the problematic fact of decisions being made by the opinion of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;the few and are now in a counterfactual situation where we confront
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;the opinion of the many (3).  In this new situation, what exactly is
