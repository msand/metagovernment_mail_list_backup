<PRE>Regarding getting people to use the app, I know for a fact that this is 
always the big problem in this whole genre of apps...

I have been building/running a &quot;shadow election&quot; app in two national 
elections now, and we think we finally nailed it in the last elections, 
as we were the dominant force on facebook, in the &quot;political 
app/content&quot; genre. On our best single day, we got impressions from 8% 
of the finnish FB population.

Thats 8% of the population per day folks.
While our app does not solve all the problems of internet democracy, it 
demonstrably solves the problem of getting people to come in the first 
place.


I'm sure you guys know all about the subject, so try it out: 
<A HREF="http://www.vaalikone2012.fi/?l=en">http://www.vaalikone2012.fi/?l=en</A>
This is the finnish presidential election, with the last 2 candidates 
remaining in the runoff...
the UI is in english, but the content is finnish gibberish, you have to 
use your imagination...

or if you have google translator, this link should kinda work with it: 
<A HREF="http://www.shadowelection.com/vaalikone2/?l=en">http://www.shadowelection.com/vaalikone2/?l=en</A>

It is also embeddable on blogs: <A HREF="http://eduskuntavaalikone.blogspot.com/">http://eduskuntavaalikone.blogspot.com/</A>

The questions ranged from &quot;when where you drunk last?&quot; to questions 
about Guantanamo, to GMO issues, to scenarios like &quot;if the US is sending 
prisoner transport planes over our territory, what do you do?&quot;, and so on.

The answers come in free text (sourced or directly entered by the 
candidate), or video, or a yes-no opinion slider thing, lots of options 
to fit any Q&amp;A format...

Our next step (after taking a stab at the US elections) is a global 
shadow election, Think of it as &quot;the election for the facebook president 
of Earth&quot;, A powersharing game with potentially real consequences.

Very much in line with what anonymous, occupy, etc. stand for...

I am acutely aware that my app is just a piece of some puzzle, so I'm 
totally willing to try and integrate it with whatever... and this global 
square thing sounds pretty good.
