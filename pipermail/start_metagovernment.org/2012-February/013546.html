<PRE>Hi Alex and Michael, 
Main Problems &#8211; Money,
infinite material desire that generate by monetary system, lack of
understanding about resources management and technology inaccessibility due to
patents.&#160; &#160;&#160;
Before I explain
housing building challenge I should explain resource based economy. 
Resource Based Economy:
&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Resource Accounting
&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Dynamic equilibrium
&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Strategic design( technological
efficiency)
Particular region must
calculate their resources, use the dynamic equilibrium for resource management
for example production of wood must relate to planting of trees. Products must
produce collaborative way with best technology we can use in this moment. 
This is a central
planning system. Interdisciplinary team (experts) involve for planning the
cities, industries and farming. Demand or opinion influenced by resource of the
region and technology of the region. Other way to demand is fulfilled with
access abundance system. Instead of property based system we should have access
based system, for example instead of own a car we have access to cars at any
time. Once we have access to houses and build according to resource base
economic model then our opinion is not use as an infinite demander, as a
participant on the system, because we know our limitation of resources and
technologies. I think this is a true participatory democracy. For produce the
stuffs of course we will use scientific method. Our opinion and
interdisciplinary team opinion are subject to resources, dynamic equilibrium
and technologies thus voting to produce stuff will be more rational and
unbiased. Access abundance may lead to the property ownership obsolete.&#160; 
Simplification- Design
everything collaborative democratic manner with resource base economic model---
Produce the stuffs according to scientific method------ access abundance.&#160; 
If we have advance
super computer, then we can design software for resource accounting, dynamic
equilibrium, strategic design with that super computer to produce best stuffs
with minimum human opinion and less interdisciplinary team involvement.
Actually United States military has such a system to produce weapons that not
use human opinion. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only thing that we have
to develop software to unite people, industries and professionals that come together
to allocate one place to develop a prototype city then rest of people can
follow. I think direct democratic software can play crucial role to overcome
this challenge. 
Let me explain housing
building in resource based economy. I have to inform interdisciplinary and
central computer that I need a house at particular region. Since it is not my
property and it is an access based method I will not have irrational desire to
have fancy staff. The house is going to build according to resource based
economic model thus I already know what resources utilize for build the houses
and technological parameters. So my opinion is reconciled with experts and
supercomputer. However in monetary system how we can ever accept experts plan
that we don&#8217;t have any idea of resources and technologies. More over manipulate
the masses by the advertising lead to over consumption of the finite resources.
I think opinion of the people and expert&#8217;s opinion are never going reconcile in
the monetary system.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;
That is why I advocate
participation of the people to understand and educate by themselves to
restriction of the resources and technologies. Then they will have self control
and satisfaction that driven by knowledge. The participation of people on decision
making process would lead to psychological tendency that they are not under
control by some authority. So participation of the people is not a problem, it
is a solution. It is a necessity until them confident over that system. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Subject: Re: [MG] scientific method
 

If the people do not like it, it is because of REASONS :-)

1. Could be, they dont like the color
2. Could be, because they want to use the building in a way that was not anticipated by the experts (a requirement that was not expressed in the first place)
3. Could be, because people have habits (structure in mind or body (like muscle memory) that built over time) and they know its too much change to anticipate the &quot;new ways&quot; of doing/living - so they might need smaller increments
4. It could be, because they don't see or comprehend how they could do all the stuff that they did in the past with the new design.
5. Could be, that cooking in the kitchen was of intrinsic value for some people, they enjoyed cooking food, and maybe the new approach uses a replicator like the one used in Star Trek - and they hate it to not be able to do their hobby, or maybe they FEAR that they are not needed anymore and dont see how they will fit into the new way of doing things
...
...its lot of potential issues - and everyone has a subjective view on the topic, so who knows if experts do not miss a perspective or maybe there are conflicting perspectives and experts need to make trade offs, because there is no technology known yet that could solve the issue with a win-win situation, or maybe in an actual situation there is no one imaginative enough to find that solution...
So in essence it SCIENCE vs ART - Is programming ART? Or is it SCIENCE? ...is XY an ART or is it SCIENCE?? - where there is room for Art and there normaly is if the issue is not trivial, - and with enough subjective perspectives there will be many requirements and thus the issue wont be trivial anymore and there will be always room for ART :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>When it comes to deciding *how* to build the housing, the opinion of

</I>&gt;<i>*less*, or in some qualified way. &#160;I want to understand exactly what
</I>&gt;<i>you mean here. &#160;Please consider this situation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&#160;(1) The people who live in a community all agree that housing is the
</I>&gt;<i>&#160; &#160; &#160;top priority for the infrastructure budget.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&#160;(2) A detailed plan is drafted by experts. &#160;The experts agree it is
</I>&gt;<i>&#160; &#160; &#160;a good plan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&#160;(3) The people who live in the community do not like the plan. &#160;They
</I>&gt;<i>&#160; &#160; &#160;agree it is a bad plan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ought the plan (2) to be executed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... If people don&#8217;t have knowledge but still they want to involve,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then they can use liquid democracy. For example energy production is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> highly technical issue that can use scientific method, if the people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have knowledge about energy production and then they can participate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly and the people who don&#8217;t have knowledge can use liquid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy. In reality people don&#8217;t have knowledge about such highly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical issues but we should have a software program that anybody
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can participate on the issue as a matter of pure democratic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> principle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You see liquid democracy (transitive delegation) as a solution to a
</I>&gt;<i>problem, or part of a solution. &#160;But before talking about the possible
</I>&gt;<i>solutions, we need a better understanding of the problem. &#160;We wished
</I>&gt;<i>away the problematic fact of decisions being made by the opinion of
</I>&gt;<i>the few and are now in a counterfactual situation where we confront
</I>&gt;<i>the opinion of the many (3). &#160;In this new situation, what exactly is
</I>&gt;<i>the problem we face?
