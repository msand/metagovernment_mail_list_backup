<PRE>Thanks for replying Russel,

The problem as you see it is: (A) political decisions are based on the
opinion of the few, which (B) is a poor basis for political decisions.

What if political decisions were instead based on the opinion of
everyone affected by them?  Would you still see a problem?

(Once we agree on the problem, we can look at where science fits in.)

&gt;<i> &#160;Hi Michael,&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;A. Political decisions are based on opinion -
</I>&gt;<i> yes
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; B. Opinion is a poor basis for political
</I>&gt;<i> decisions - yes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If so, what is your evidence for A?
</I>&gt;<i> As we know all
</I>&gt;<i> political decisions are made by hands of the few. They are so called
</I>&gt;<i> politicians. Their opinions are political decisions. In democracy, we have just
</I>&gt;<i> illusion of control. 
</I>&gt;<i> Evidence for political
</I>&gt;<i> decisions are based on opinion &#8211; How much money state print, foreign policy,
</I>&gt;<i> State security, education , transportation etc. are all based on opinions. All
</I>&gt;<i> political decisions are made by hand of the few politicians opinions. Our resources,
</I>&gt;<i> security, environment etc. manage by few people&#8217;s opinions. We called that
</I>&gt;<i> system politics.&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> Politics
</I>&gt;<i> I think politic is a
</I>&gt;<i> byproduct of two phenomenons.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Statism &#8211; Use of the
</I>&gt;<i> state power to achieve goals is politics. Who is having the state power? As we
</I>&gt;<i> everybody knows hands of the few. Why it is on the hand of few? Because it is
</I>&gt;<i> establish intuition to maintain the power of few. How the state established?
</I>&gt;<i> State arises as a result competing slave ownership. A large tribe with a slave
</I>&gt;<i> owner is called country. In fact present day country is a tribe with a flag and
</I>&gt;<i> anthem. State use our group behavior to accomplish state goal that maintain the
</I>&gt;<i> establish intuitions on the expense of human freedom and development. 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Failure of economics
</I>&gt;<i> &#8211; Economics is household management in Greek term. Historically we agricultural
</I>&gt;<i> humans had scarcity on supply of the products. That maintains the price base
</I>&gt;<i> economics such as capitalism, communism, socialism or fascism. However we
</I>&gt;<i> industrial humans obtain the technological capacity to produce more than we consume.
</I>&gt;<i> So growth and scarcity no longer exist to maintain the price of product, but
</I>&gt;<i> establish political institutions, banks and co operations want artificially
</I>&gt;<i> create scarcity and growth to maintain price structure. Politics is a byproduct
</I>&gt;<i> of fail economics. When people&#8217;s needs are meet exchange, money, politics are
</I>&gt;<i> obsolete. Educated people need no control. Even we need control we can have
</I>&gt;<i> that control with minimum human opinion.&#160; &#160;&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand not
</I>&gt;<i> only opinion is poor basis politics, politics itself limit our freedom and
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary phenomena for advance economic model such as resource based
</I>&gt;<i> economy. So I hope direct democracy can break the power of establish
</I>&gt;<i> institutions and people will have collective freedom to obtain resource based
</I>&gt;<i> economy that politics and opinions are irrelevant.&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you will
</I>&gt;<i> understand my view. If not please ask any questions. I will explain as much I can. 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank
</I>&gt;<i> you very much
</I>&gt;<i> Russel

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Russel,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Before looking at your proposed solution, I want to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> problem as you see it.&#160; Is it the following?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; A. Political decisions are based on opinion
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; B. Opinion is a poor basis for political decisions
