<PRE>Yeah whatever - i don't care if it's a game or for real world examples...
:<i>-)
</I>what i'm interested in is concepts for tools and processes and how they
might be solved. Thats na necessity for real world practice as its for a
game that might be played.
So if you/we have a game, i might take the mechanics to try them in the
field, while u create a game and find players that play it...

...but before we can play the game or use the mechanics in the real world
we actually NEED the mechanics :)
And thats what i'm curious about. Before you can program a game, you have
to think about what you want to program..

</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Alex, Greetings! (I have not at all forgotten that I still have not
</I>&gt;<i> responded to your second excellent critique on the Appraisal System thread
</I>&gt;<i> back in July. I am working on two articles now that will have various
</I>&gt;<i> responses to your critiques incorporated into them.)
</I>&gt;<i> Creating &quot;Full-Spectrum&quot; Collaborative Governance Systems
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt;My thought is that, if we are actually going to be creating *new*kinds of governance systems (rather than merely &quot;pouring old wine into new
</I>&gt;<i> bottles&quot;), that we should start out in a virtual laboratory: an online game
</I>&gt;<i> that anyone in the world can play, in which the real world is mapped onto
</I>&gt;<i> the game's virtual world, so that real world governance decisions
</I>&gt;<i> (including virtual company decisions) can be made within the game.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt;Scientists generally start in the laboratory when dealing with new and
</I>&gt;<i> not yet understood systems, for good reason. If we were to start out in any
</I>&gt;<i> sort of situation in which people's lives and livelihoods were at risk, we
</I>&gt;<i> would not be able to play at the edges and have things blow up from time to
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt;As an example, all of the potential problems for the appraisal system
</I>&gt;<i> that you have pointed to in your critiques are there. In the online game,
</I>&gt;<i> we could plunge heedlessly ahead, study how the problems manifest (even
</I>&gt;<i> inviting obnoxious people to try to break the systems), and figure out how
</I>&gt;<i> to solve them -- without doing real-world damage in the process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt;Only after the new collaborative governance systems had proven
</I>&gt;<i> themselves in the virtual world should anyone trust them in the real world.
</I>&gt;<i> (*I* certainly wouldn't trust them until they had.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ned&gt; As with the &quot;working ballot experiment&quot;, the &quot;full collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> governance experiment&quot; has never been run before, and has not until now
</I>&gt;<i> even been possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -- the new governance systems will need to use technologies that are
</I>&gt;<i> only now available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about starting with &quot;full collaborative governance&quot; for companies?
</I>&gt;<i> There is the corporate governance, there might be a court of arbitration,
</I>&gt;<i> security guards, developement of vision, mission statement, and guiding
</I>&gt;<i> principles, distribution of income streams, make-or-buy-decisions,
</I>&gt;<i> operational execution, and so on....
</I>&gt;<i> In essence, what we have is a group of people that do selforganisation of
</I>&gt;<i> their life's ...but in practice they find out, that because of special
</I>&gt;<i> skills they have and special ressources they have access to, they do NOT
</I>&gt;<i> selforganize their entire life, but use MAKE-OR-BUY-Decisions to cooperate
</I>&gt;<i> with others (externals) ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> today, normal organisations are not really groups of people that work
</I>&gt;<i> together at eye level, but instead they have hierarchies. There might be in
</I>&gt;<i> fact companys that have very flat hierarchies but they still have them.
</I>&gt;<i> some might use democracy as a mechanism but that often leads to the reign
</I>&gt;<i> of the will of majority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what systems do we need to enable companys of partners to be founded
</I>&gt;<i> adhoc and disbanded adhoc? If u have 5 people, thats probably not a big
</I>&gt;<i> deal...what if its 50 people? what if its 500? what if its thousands?
</I>&gt;<i> .....what if its millions - like whole nations?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What principle could be used to make it scale?
</I>&gt;<i> I like votorola, because it scales so nicely, but votorola is only part of
</I>&gt;<i> the picture - maybe its hard to think about all the things a country has to
</I>&gt;<i> take care of, we could start with something smaller, like companys... there
</I>&gt;<i> are small companys and there are large companys - whats there needs?
</I>&gt;<i> maybe its possible to learn about skills that occupy people have and
</I>&gt;<i> enable them to found their own OCCUPY COMPANYS that use alternative
</I>&gt;<i> principles backed by the right open source software, that will enable them
</I>&gt;<i> to be more effective than traditional companys... if thats the case, other
</I>&gt;<i> companys might start to copy this principles and new startups might uses
</I>&gt;<i> this mechanisms and so the experience of living in such a system will be
</I>&gt;<i> spread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not only will it enable occupy to become independent of the traditional
</I>&gt;<i> systems, because they can cater themselves, but also will they inspire
</I>&gt;<i> others if they succeed.
</I>&gt;<i> Starting on a company level will also give us feedback of what works an
</I>&gt;<i> what doesnt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> what do you think of it?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways that were potentially effective then we could no longer claim that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote is absolutely without effect in the world. Its effect would instead be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incalculable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I confess that I don't quite understand what you are saying here, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why you are saying it, or what it has to do with my remark that you quoted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Sometimes I'm slow -- sorry.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Analysis Topic 1: Vote Power OR Proposal Power
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The &quot;tongue power&quot; I was referring to (I thought I was following
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your usage ...) is that of **giving reasons** for preferring one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative over another. From the &quot;tongue power&quot; perspective, a vote is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just a grunt -- a gesture. Beyond merely expressing preference, it is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usefully communicative -- it expresses no **reasons** for the choice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In order to have collaborative governance, the **reasons** for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preferences must be given. When I present a thesis that you don't find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acceptable for various reasons, the most efficient and effective way to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proceed is for you to articulate an **analysis** (analytically break out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the parts you find problematic, and articulate the perspectives from which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you see problems) and then propose **antitheses** (for each part, from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each perspective, give the **reasons** that you find the part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problematic). That then gives the two of us (and others who wish to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involved) the necessary information to be able to seek a synthesis that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> satisfies everyone. A sketch of the full recursive synthesis process might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be [thesis &gt; analysis &gt; antitheses &gt; ... (recursive drilling down) ... &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> syntheses &gt; synthesis].
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; As is done in Votorola, you could present an alternative thesis (or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thesis fragment -- recombinant text) without articulating any analyses or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> antitheses, but that would leave me (and others) having to guess about *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *why** you prefer your thesis to mine. This would greatly hamper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attempts by myself and others to come up with a synthesis that might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> satisfy us all. To get from thesis to synthesis most effectively and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efficiently, it is highly helpful to go through analysis and antithesis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Using voting as a decision mechanism short-circuits this recursive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synthesis process of communicating **reasons**. My suggestion is that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abandon voting entirely, and instead create a decision system that uses *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *proposing** (proposal = preference + reasons) as the decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanism. That is what I meant when I said &quot;I am a really big fan of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tongue power -- I think that that's the way we should go.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Analysis Topic 2: The Political Power of a Vote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; If all votes are weighted equally, then the **maximum** relative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political power that each vote can have (in terms of its formal effect in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making the legislative decision) is 1/N. When the voting population numbers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (N) in the millions or billions, this is a vanishingly small serving of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political power. I see an attempt to increase the political power of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote of each citizen from zero to 1/N as an attempt to give each citizen a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bigger thimble with which to try to bail out this global Titanic that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Analysis Topic 3: The Other Structural Fault
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike&gt; Nor could we claim (as I do) that the lack of that vote [carrying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the full 1/N political power] is the root cause of political bondage,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economic injustice and other widespread human rights violations [and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> war, poverty, biosphere degradation, fleecing future generations, etc.].
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; After a legislative decision is made (even through full-power 1/N
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting), the legislation is then handed over to hierarchs and capitalists
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and banksters for execution and adjudication. The governance systems of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hierarchs and the capitalists and banksters are not democratic: about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best that the general citizenry can do to try to affect those decisions is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to stand out in the streets (in the freezing cold) waving signs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In my view, trying to create a voting system that increases the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political power of the vote of each citizen from zero to 1/N is like trying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to fix a crack in the legislative sidewalk (structural fault #1) of Jiminy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cricket Land. At the end of that sidewalk (at the point that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legislation is passed) lies the Grand Canyon (structural fault #2). On the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other side of that Grand Canyon lies the Land of the Hierarchs and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Capitalists and Banksters to which the legislation is passed, where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy and collaboration are not to be found, and where political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bondage, economic injustice, widespread human rights violations, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flourish -- it is the land where we all actually live, when we are not in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jiminy Cricket Land voting to generate better quality legislation for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hierarchs and capitalists and banksters to ignore.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In order for collaborative governance to be able to actually produce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good governance outcomes in the real world, the collaborative governance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system must be capable of rendering hierarchies and capitalism and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parasitic banking obsolete, which means that the system must be capable of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making all of the governance decisions that hierarchs and capitalists and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> banksters now make, more effectively and efficiently than hierarchs and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capitalists and banksters now make those decisions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; To me it seems that resolving structural fault #1 without resolving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structural fault #2 would be an empty gesture. And, any collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance system that was capable of resolving structural fault #2 would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> almost certainly also be capable of resolving structural fault #1 as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For both those reasons, I would suggest that we should be focusing on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conceiving and creating a collaborative governance system capable of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolving structural fault #2.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Analysis Topic 4: The &quot;Just Do It!&quot; Approach
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike&gt; Would it [the full-power 1/N vote] really make a difference? I say
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yes, you say no, but really nobody knows because nobody ever tried it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before. So we'll try it: we'll put a working ballot in the elector's hands
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and see what comes of it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; There is indeed much to commend the &quot;Just Do It!&quot; approach. I wish
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you well with your experiment. (And also, we would all potentially be more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effective in our quest to &quot;make things better&quot; if we could collaboratively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work through to conceiving an experiment that we would all be willing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaborate on running together. Our efforts and resources could then be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synergistically rather than dysergistically employed.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Analysis Topic 5: Diagnosing The Primary Root Problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike&gt; What is the root cause in your own theory?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I see our primary root problem as being that some of the social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arrangements we have now set up positive feedback loops that (over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generations) steadily concentrate more and more wealth and power into fewer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and fewer hands. These days, the three main social arrangement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concentrators happen to be hierarchies, capitalism, and parasitic banking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In other times, other social arrangements have served to increasingly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concentrate power.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Analysis Topic 6: Solving The Primary Root Problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; So long as we continue to be dependent on the decision making of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hierarchs, capitalists, and banksters, we cannot remove them from power,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nor render their roles and their systems obsolete. Therefore, we first need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a fully operational collaborative governance *decision system* capable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of making all of the decisions that hierarchs, capitalists, and banksters
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now make, more effectively and efficiently than they now make those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; As with the &quot;working ballot experiment&quot;, the &quot;full collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance experiment&quot; has never been run before, and has not until now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even been possible -- the new governance systems will need to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technologies that are only now available.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Analysis Topic 7: Experimental Validation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike: Is it [your proposed root problem, your proposed governance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution] open to experimental validation?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I would say yes. *Any* proposed root problem diagnosis, and any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposed governance system solution can be experimentally validated (at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least indirectly). Governance systems produce governance outcomes (war,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poverty, biosphere degradation, etc. on the &quot;bad&quot; side, citizens thriving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and such on the &quot;good&quot; side) that are objectively observable and measurable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> phenomena. To determine whether a proposed problem diagnosis is valid, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether a proposed solution does effectively resolve the problem, one would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> measure and track the governance *outcomes* produced by the decisions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the governance system. For example, if the diagnosis were that concentrated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power is the root cause of wars, and the proposed governance system then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leads to no more wars, that would constitute evidence (however fuzzy and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disputable) that the diagnosis and solution were valid.
