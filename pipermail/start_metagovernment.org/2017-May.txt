Finally got around to reading the winning essays. What a complete load
of horse shit! No wonder my entry didn't win: These essays are look
just like word-blended versions of all the stuff they've already
published. No real insight into *why* and *how* our current systems
fail to work (nothing on decisionmaking *at all* in *any* of the
winners!) and countless examples of amateur social engineering
(although to be fair the ratio of handwaving to actual social
engineering is at least 10 to 1). It's just sad.

And to make matters worse, their whole setup seems *designed* to
prevent criticism or debate on any of the articles: There's no
comments section, no forum, no mailing list, none of the authors
include their email addresses in their articles, and none of their
websites have "contact" links. So I've taken the opportunity to create
a forum for them and posted my criticism of the "big" winner (first
place in the unrestricted category) there:
http://www.matchism.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=15

I can't say I'm recommending wasting time reading the original article
because I'm sure you'll learn exactly nothing useful from it, but
maybe it's worth doing merely as exercise in criticism and
competition...

Man I could not agree more.

With each other their "solutions" we're just reading more about how
bio-regionalism is cool or something, they're clearly not committed to
enacting any serious plans or even discussing content they post.

Why're these people even here? Do they actually believe in what they're
doing?

Hopefully, the Global Challenges Prize doesn't pull some crap like this.
They seem promising too.

At least in theory what they're funding is actual
development/deployment rather than handwaving, the specialty of the
Next System Project. But I'm having a little trouble conceiving of a
system that would meet their criteria, the sticking point being that
the system has to work with dictators as major participants (because
they rule out changing local decisionmaking as part of the process).
This always leads me back to coercive techniques, something that as a
social engineer I generally reject as being ineffective in the long
term because they create large incentives to invest in ways of gaming
the system. As such I'm starting to consider the Global Challenges
Prize as an exercise in developing barn-door-closing mechanisms that
work after the horse has already bolted.

The discovery by me of the Rojava region and the "libertarian municipalism"
 and the possibility  to extend such system using a internet decisional
based platform is sufficient to look at the future with optimism.
Looks like hardship always brings out the best from humans.

Yeah, right: A "revolution" that's a few years old and which governs a
population the size of a small city is a shining beacon? I think you
would be far better served studying how the soviet system, which
started out a lot like Rojava, eventually failed when the SDAPs
transitioned it to totalitarianism. "libertarian municipalism" is just
another variant of the same kind of amateur social engineering we've
seen repeatedly fail: You either understand how psychopaths create and
control hierarchies or you repeat the mistakes of the past.

> Looks like hardship always brings out the best from humans.

Sure, but it also brings out the psychopaths: Hitler, Mao, Stalin, and
Pol Pot *all* came to power exactly because the people were
experiencing severe resource deprivation and so were inspired to
revolution. Taking this as a lesson will only result in you creating a
system that psychopaths will use to exploit The People. For example,
you can learn a lot more about "cooperatives" by studying how the
Soviets and the Asian communists figured out how to exploit them than
by studying some fresh new example that only hasn't had time to
promote a psychopath that has figured out how to game that particular
system.

Subject: [MG]  epistemology of constitutional design
Message-ID: <CAApCfOBA-u0LPicrMBjDGqMDY3nt5Huj6DNnUJQGwx-f7Lyx4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am still working on the comparison of systems, I am calling it now
epistemology of constitutional design (or prediction of goodness)

the important words in it are "epistemologic strength"
nice example you will find in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine

and some variations of
constitutional (electoral) design (engineering)

Cheers
m.

I definitely hear what you're both saying about hardship, it's one hell of
a double edged sword isn't it?


 I get a good feeling about this Lazslow guy. He saw what ethnic violence
looks like as a kid when he had to flee his own country, and through his
experience in business has seen how necessary this kind of work really is.

He published his book for free online, and the very style of it suggests to
me he's a man trying to leave a legacy his descendants can respect. It's
not 'intellectualist' or elite at all, he basically squeezed a lifetime of
UN analysis into a roughly 100 page book about the
scientifically-established threats to humanity, written in plain English.

He does mention one of the problems as an excess in state sovereignty, and
openly proposes globalism, but only because he sees self-interest as a
threat to world peace. And he's very open about that. I personally agree we
should have a few strong international agreements in place to ensure
countries can take responsible measures without seeing their businesses
just move to shittier countries so they can abuse people and pollute out
there.

I think it's a good read, here's a link to it if anyone wants.

https://api.globalchallenges.org/static/files/the-greatest-challenges-of-our-time.pdf

 As always let me know if you see any bugs but also remember I only wanna
hear it if it's credible. No Illuminati shit for me : )

SDAP find potential threats to expansion extremely undesireable.  On the
other hand, self interest is hardly undesireable.  None of this suggest
democracy as an influence on foreign policy is particularly desireable. On
the other hand, our elites are often remarkedly blind.  Maybe We SHOUlD Fix
Our elITES

Interesting. There is a lot of work in constitutional comparisons, with
whole university courses and chairs on this topic. Are you looking into it?

It's a good list of proximate problems, and at least doesn't include
handwaving about things like "income inequality" or other red
herrings. Of course I also believe that he's missed the true
underlying cause, and you see it in his repeated expressions of
deference to "politicians" and "leaders". It's ironic, and a little
surprising that he cites Einstein at the start of Chapter 6: ?We can?t
solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we
created them" and yet blindly plows on assuming the next system will
be structured almost exactly the same as our current system with a
hierarchy of politicians who we will have to trust to make decisions
for us...

Certainly props due for the attempt, but is publishing this paper
really part of the process of solving any of the problems discussed in
it? I.e., is the problem simply that we don't know these things, or is
it really that we have no decisionmaking system capable of actually
dealing with any of them?

True, but he also specifically rules out any changes to existing
political boundaries because "This is impractical because there are
simply too many and too
great differences among nations? languages, cultures, economies and
political systems." Which IMHO is factually inaccurate (what is the
EU, chopped liver?!?). It's also a recipe for failure, something he
later even directly acknowledges:

"Leaders of undemocratic nations, who place
their own personal interests above those of their people, would
naturally be on the list of losers. That list would also include
politicians who strive for special positions of power, for their
nations or themselves."

Which is a fatal flaw in his proposal: Does he actually expect
dictators and other authoritarian states to volunteer to become
"losers"? If not, then the entire proposal is unworkable because it
*requires* this to happen, and yet "voluntarily" (no wars, no defense
budgets, etc.)

But will international agreements written and then approved by
politicians have any chance of achieving this? We The People I think
could do this, but IMHO we'll have to do it ourselves.

> I think it's a good read, here's a link to it if anyone wants.

I agree it's worth reading, especially if you plan to enter the
competition. But I also think it's important to understand that there
are large loopholes and unsupported assumptions, some of which are
even unstated, in the paper that you'll have to deal with (or exploit,
depending on your requirements ;-)

That there are missing bits is understandable given that's it's
primarily intended as a call to action rather than as a specific
social engineering design. The latter is our job to provide ;-)

True, but also threats to their own power and prestige.

Agreed. It's the engine that drives evolution, and also capitalism.
It's as natural to us as breathing.

Or replace them. IMHO they're mostly unfixable because even if they
could somehow figure out how to represent us, they wouldn't do it
anyway because they're just not that kind of people. I have no
delusion that https://www.proxyfor.me/ is not just another elite-based
system, but at least the elites will be selected from the entire
population rather than just from the subset who have a will to
political power...

Much more complete than the last time I reviewed it. Unfortunately,
now I have a bunch of new criticisms ;-)
1) I repeat my criticism of last time that the "listicle" at the
beginning is not only not necessary, but counterproductive. Everybody
already knows how screwed up our current systems are, but
unfortunately they all disagree as to exactly *how*. This
Chomsky-esque list is going to be a huge turnoff for conservatives,
for example, and if you lose them, your entire system loses legitimacy
as a platform suitable for representing *all* The People.

2) The political party requirement is a non-starter IMHO for the same
reason: You can't allow bundling people together who all agree on some
subset of issues because by doing so you're eliminating the majority
of people who don't agree on the "party platform" for those issues.
Again, legitimacy goes away when you do this.

3) I considered and rejected the multiple choice option for individual
issues because there is no practical way to combine votes into
majority opinion in most cases. It fails even in your "death penalty"
example: What is the decision if equal numbers of people choose each
option?

4) Of course it also doesn't deal with the SDAP/activert
participation-rate issue, the one issue I believe is the key to
success and the one thing that https://www.proxyfor.me/ handles
properly that no other system that I've heard of does.

5) Your delegation system can't work any better than the Liquid
Feedback system which the data clearly showed failed miserably to
properly represent the people. Again, only the proxyfor.me design
(i.e., automatic delegate/proxy assignment) can reliably do this
AFAIK.

I'd therefore recommend you follow your own suggestion WRT
collaboration and figure out what, if anything, is wrong with
proxyfor.me and help fix that instead of proceeding with implementing
this proposal. The "real world" has kept me very busy the past few
weeks and so I haven't had time to do much work on the next phase of
proxyfor.me: marketing (the technical parts all seem to be working
well, and with pleasingly low CPU and bandwidth requirements). But
things look to be opening up for me in a couple/few weeks and I look
forward to getting any suggestions any of you may have as to how to
get people to start signing up and using this new system.

And therefore, yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/  is deemed to fail
I predicted the failure of Votorola and I was right
I predicted the failure of Airesis (just ask Jacopo and Marino) and I was right
I predicted nobody would use Vilfredo and I was right
I now predict that nobody will use yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/
Too complicated

I will work with any software, any one, which is simple and easy to use and I predict will be used by the masses
Your software is just driven by your gigantic ego and will fail

There's a reason I never said his book is the answer, his book is about the
need for an answer, from a reputable source. That's just one of the
elements we need as solution builders to make this thing happen.

Matteo this kind of answer really turn me off, because it is not in any way
educate to address other opinion as stupid or criticize someone to promote
their own project.

Objection to the statement "how frequently". It is probably  not frequent
that someone win the lottery but sure someone do.

Now let me tell you that if you consider proxyfor.me too complicate i doubt
in your intelligence, so far the proxy vote that the system have given
match my vote so I see it as a promising addendum to a collaborative
proposal making software. In the same way I see Vilfredo as potential
method for collaborative paragraph editing of a proposal making software.
Voting multiple choice is not considered in proxyfor.me so far so the
voting in Airesis can be used where this may be necessary.
There is not a single "way" to address world problem and IMHO there will
never be one, but a network of interlaced and integrated intelligent
methods is the answer.
Peace

My wife and I were actually talking about this WRT marketing just last
night: The easiest way to get something unfamiliar adopted by people
who don't have the time or inclination to explore is to have a
celebrity endorse it. It's a Clination, to be sure, but in my opinion
as a social engineer one that we should be actively working to
suppress (in my experience celebrities model bad behavior more often
than good, and many of them are just manipulating psychopaths). That
said, I'm inclined to use "the ends justifies the means" rule,
particularly since the "means" are techniques that people are already
being manipulated by on a vast scale (i.e., advertising) and so one
more instance can't do them any significant additional harm...

This is a textbook example of an ad-hominem attack: If you lack the
facts or intellectual chops to criticize a proposal, criticize the
person who promotes it.

And I note that you didn't respond to any of the specific criticisms:
*That* is the real recipe for failure.

Really, I'm doing him a huge favor: Taking the time to read and find
the flaws (and pointing out how some other system doesn't have them)
is the best way to help the creator make it better. IMHO the cruelest
thing is to allow people to continue to waste time on something that
you can easily find the flaws in that they seem to be blind to.

Yeah, and it's not about frequency anyway: There's just no way to do
Condorcet-type combinations on things like his "Death Penalty"
example. The only reason techniques like that *appear* to work when
choosing representatives is because misrepresentative government is so
bad at "representing" us that we consider even getting it marginally
better a big improvement.

Agreed, and we learn as much from seeing what *doesn't* work in the
various projects as we gain by "borrowing" the best parts. That paper
describing the failure of the LQFB delegation system I consider to be
the single greatest influence in my conception of how direct democracy
can be implemented.

Spoken as someone who has an agenda *other* than implementing
democracy: Your statements may indeed be factual (though I suspect
that most contain at least exaggerations if not outright falsehoods),
but again make it clear that your agenda is reigning in the US and
other superpowers, not doing anything for The People. They're just
tools for you to use in achieving your goals. This is exactly the kind
of thinking that brought us Mao and Stalin.

I submit you have it exactly backwards: At least we're comfortable

I think again you're missing the point: The delegation system in LQFB

Hi all,

thank you for your answers, despite I see many people disagreeing with 
me here

The newsletter system is not, IMHO, the best system to work with as it 
is quite difficult to quote someone in a clear and easy way

This said, I will reply in one mail to criticisms by both Jacopo and Scott

1)

Spoken as someone who has an agenda *other* than implementing
democracy: Your statements may indeed be factual (though I suspect
that most contain at least exaggerations if not outright falsehoods),
but again make it clear that your agenda is reigning in the US and
other superpowers, not doing anything for The People. They're just
tools for you to use in achieving your goals. This is exactly the kind
of thinking that brought us Mao and Stalin. (by Scott)
=>  My statements are factual and you can check any of them in Wikipedia.
I have no agenda reigning in anyone. I just stated facts.
I criticized mostly the US and the West as, IMHO, they are the richest and most powerful people on the planet so they have the moral duty to behave well.
Islamic terrorists and crimes by Russians and Chinese have also be pointed out when they commit crimes
Telling me that the desire to pointing out war crimes and to promote direct democracy is the kind of thinking that brought us Mao and Stalin is an utterly moronic statement
In fact, one of the most moronic statements I have heard in my life (and I have heard many of them)

2)
This is a textbook example of an ad-hominem attack: If you lack the
facts or intellectual chops to criticize a proposal, criticize the
person who promotes it.
And I note that you didn't respond to any of the specific criticisms:
*That*  is the real recipe for failure.  (by Scott)

=>  I criticized the proposals for one single reason: they failed
Airesis failed. This is a fact. Nobody really uses Airesis today. It 
failed, Simple as that. Money, time and resources all wasted, so far.
Vilfredo failed. Same reason above
Am I attacking someone by saying the facts? I do not think so.
I also replied to your criticisms for as much as I could

3)

Really, I'm doing him a huge favor: Taking the time to read and find
the flaws (and pointing out how some other system doesn't have them)
is the best way to help the creator make it better. IMHO the cruelest
thing is to allow people to continue to waste time on something that
you can easily find the flaws in that they seem to be blind to.
(by Scott)
->  Thank you for the favour, but let me ask you..
If you know the flaws of the systems well, why have not you promoted a successful direct democracy system so far?
You have been here much longer than me, and you are talking with many people.
More than me.
If you are so smart to find the flaws in my system, can you please tell me how many governments and/or organizations are using yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/?
Your system is already online, the one I am proposing is just an idea.
So there should be already tens if not hundreds of governments interested in working with you today.
Can you tell me who they are?
Since you are talking and discussing with Jacopo, Pietro and others, and they too have been promoting DD systems for years, could you tell me who is using any of their systems?
Airesis took years and the work of many many people to be brought to life. How many people are using it in the government today?
I have been hearing about Vilfredo for years. Same question

4)
Yeah, and it's not about frequency anyway: There's just no way to do
Condorcet-type combinations on things like his "Death Penalty"
example. The only reason techniques like that*appear*  to work when
choosing representatives is because misrepresentative government is so
bad at "representing" us that we consider even getting it marginally
better a big improvement.  (by Scott)

->  I am looking for marginally better improvements.
There are usually the ones which work.
I would not ask Pietro and Jacopo and you for designing the best system that solves ALL the problems in the world as you have all tried to do so
And failed
And you have yet to understand this simple point, apparently.
So I set the bar for any system a little bit lower
As I do not like failures

5)
Agreed, and we learn as much from seeing what*doesn't*  work in the
various projects as we gain by "borrowing" the best parts. That paper
describing the failure of the LQFB delegation system I consider to be
the single greatest influence in my conception of how direct democracy
can be implemented.  (by Scott)

->  You are talking about your own system again here.
Fine with that.
How many people are using it today?
Millions? Not yet?
Thousands? Not yet?
Hundreds? Not yet?
I hereby officially predict how many people will be using your system one, five and ten years from now.
Reply: Zero
Why I say so?
As it is too complicated and too unnecessarily complicated
People will never use it

6)
Please read your proposal again, specifically item 2.1, 4, 9, and 22.
Did you even write this thing?
(by Scott)

-> I also wrote that a political party may not be needed at the beginning

7)
You missed the point: Your death penalty example (#15) has 7 possible
responses. How do you combine votes for each of them to reach a
decision?
(by Scott)

->  You do not
You just take the two responses who got the largest number of votes and have a vote on those two
Simple as that.
Got the word?
Simple

8)
No, but given that mine came before yours you should at least be
familiar with it before spouting off. Clearly you're not.
(by Scott)
->  I started this thread speaking about a proposed system which is not yours and you used the replies in this thread to write the URL of your system quite a few times so far
Fine with that, I am not jealous
Now, let me ask you
Since as you have pointed out you have been here longer than me, please tell me how many governments/organizations are using your software (which is already in beta stage) now.
Or even consider doing it
Is it 1000?
Is it 100?
Is it 10?
Is it 1?
Is it noone?

9)
I submit you have it exactly backwards: At least we're comfortable
with turning control over to the People. Until you get rid of the
screed that makes up the first half of your proposal it appears to be
more about how to manipulate them into achieving the outcomes*you*
specify.
(by Scott)
-> I just stated facts
Plain facts and the reasons why I believe it is important to be engaged with DD
If people do not like facts, this is their problem
Not mine

10)
Says the guy who hasn't invested even a few minutes to understand how
it works...
(by Scott)
->  Slowly but surely you are getting there
I DO NOT want to invest more than 5 minutes to read your proposal as PEOPLE will not spend more than 5 minutes to read your proposal
Why is it so difficult to understand?
People in general are not ego-driven guys who are looking to have the best system in the world
They just need something simple which works
This is why your complicated system will fail
Same as Airesis
Same as Vilfredo
Same as Votorola
Same as LQFB

11)
I think again you're missing the point: The delegation system in LQFB
*didn't*  work and therefore was a deal breaker for the adoption of the
system. If a system really does manage to capture The Will of The
People no amount of conflict in the SDAP leadership of the movement
will be able to stop it.
(by Scott)
-> This is your opinion. I respect but disagree with it.
At least we can agree that LQFB failed. As Airesis and as Vilfredo

12)
Matteo this kind of answer really turn me off, because it is not in any way
educate to address other opinion as stupid or criticize someone to promote
their own project.
(by Jacopo)
  ->  Well, I always prefer to be honest and straightforward than to be false.
We discussed this before with you, I think. And I did not call anyone as stupid here

13)  Objection to the statement "how frequently". It is probably  not frequent
that someone win the lottery but sure someone do.
(by Jacopo)
  ->  True
But you do not take a huge loan on the grounds that one day you may win the lottery and pay it off, right?
And exceptions like having two proposals with the exact number of votes can always be handled somehow
Right?

14)
Now let me tell you that if you consider proxyfor.me too complicate i doubt
in your intelligence, so far the proxy vote that the system have given
match my vote so I see it as a promising addendum to a collaborative
proposal making software.
(by Jacopo)
->  Please be welcome and doubt of my intelligence!! :)
Along with the intelligence of 100% of the world population who is not using proxyforme and never will


15)  In the same way I see Vilfredo as potential
method for collaborative paragraph editing of a proposal making software.
(by Jacopo)
->  And I see Vilfredo as a total failure.
Nobody is using it.
Nobody is using a system derivative from Vilfredo to govern
The only thing Vilfredo may have been useful for is for Pietro to have his name in some trendy journal article

16)  Voting multiple choice is not considered in proxyfor.me so far so the
voting in Airesis can be used where this may be necessary.
There is not a single "way" to address world problem and IMHO there will
never be one, but a network of interlaced and integrated intelligent
methods is the answer.
(by Jacopo)
  
->  Airesis failed so far and will never be used
Why then even mention it?
Do you remember how many times, when we had those calls at night, I told you airesis was too complicated and would never work?
Do you remember that?
Do you remember when I told this to Alessandro and he replied to me that there were thousands of users and hundreds of organizations working on Airesis so far?
Where are they now?
I first told Nicola giulietti they had to make a simple system back in 2011
He did not listen to me
you did nor listen
You failed
Are not you unhappy to have spent so much money and time and then got out with nothing?

That's a problem with your mail program, not email lists in general.
Most email programs, including gmail and all popular UNIX mail
programs, do quotes as above (with > signs, one per level of quoting).

Yeah, that's a bad idea too: You should respond to messages as they
come in to properly record the context.

And if I claim that you're an idiot that doesn't have any idea what
you're doing, that may be a fact too but it certainly doesn't advance
the case of any of us understanding exactly how and why you fail to
understand why your proposal is generating this response, nor help us
decide what to do about it. Your agenda is revealed by the examples
you provide, which aren't examples of the failure of government
decisionmaking, but rather failures of SDAP personalities in
decisionmaking positions. And then you fail to even deal with that
issue by creating a party and and a new "elite" that will apparently
be responsible for the actual decisionmaking because The People can't
be bothered to spend 5 minutes researching an issue before voting on
it.

> =>  I criticized the proposals for one single reason

That is not a criticism, that's merely a statement of your opinion. A
valid criticism would include an analysis of *why* they failed.

> ->  Thank you for the favour, but let me ask you..

Umm, I'm working on it: proxyfor.me was just recently released for
beta test and as yet has no marketing plan. I also haven't finished
the open-source release yet which is something I need to get done
before I can actually promote it as an open source project which is I
consider to be an essential feature of any new public policy
decisionmaking system.

> ->  I am looking for marginally better improvements.

And yet you've proposed nothing that is even marginally better than
anything that has come before, nor even demonstrated that you
understand *why* any of the other systems "failed" (as you call it).
Just a few data points to put the timeframe of adoption process of
things like this in perspective:
It was 60 years between the publication of the "Communist Manifesto"
and the Bolshevik revolution
The number of Christians didn't break 10000 until over a hundred years
after Jesus died
The American Colonies were established (and immediately began feuding
with the Brits) 170 years before the American Revolution

I.e., it's way too early to call any of the projects you cite as failures...

OK, so your proposal is just confusing and internally inconsistent, not wrong.

Lord help us if they're all as thick-headed and superficial as you,
but fortunately proxyfor.me will work to provide good representation
even if 99.99% of the population turns out to be this way. How does
your system provide this?

It's not an opinion that the LQFB delegation system didn't work, it's
a fact (read the paper). And your delegation system works exactly the
same way: Why won't it fail in exactly the same way?

Hi Scott

And if I claim that you're an idiot that doesn't have any idea what
you're doing, that may be a fact too but it certainly doesn't advance
the case of any of us understanding exactly how and why you fail to
understand why your proposal is generating this response, nor help us
decide what to do about it.

-> I see we are rapidly advancing to the point of insulting each other
I have no interest in taking part to this discussion
Airesis failed as noone is using it today
No government, no major institution
If the goal of a platform is to be used for DD and it is not being used, this is a failure
If you think that Airesis, or proxyforme will be successful in 60 years, good luck with it.
People with problems today need solutions today, not in 60 years
In 60 years or more you will not be here probably nor me
I have now memorized your mail in my agenda
If we will both be here in 2018, I will write you on the 1st of July 2018 a mail
In this mail there will be a question, the question is "why no major institution is using your software"?
You will then claim that the people were bad, the governments were bad, etc etc.
Like every other person does as they do not want to understand why they are failing.
Remember my words.
I have said the same words to Nicola Giulietti in 2011, to Ed and to everybody else
They wasted time and money for nothing
Look at where is Votorola today:  http://reluk.ca/project/votorola/genealogy.xht
Look at where is Airesis today
Ask Jacopo Tolja how many times I have told him they were on the wrong path
They did not listen and they had to close the project after having invested years or work and tens of thousands of $
How sad.
And now some of them is blaming the evil govenrment who is allegedly boycotting the project
How sad..
I believe there WILL be soon a DD system that will be widely used, as soon as some one does not daydream like you and the rest of the people
And creates something useful and easy

After that, I have nothing else to say
After all, the time you are wasting is only yours
You are living in the zone, my friend..
Just do not become sad or angry against the world when you will see that your project has failed

It is worth calling out this assumption as another fatal problem with
your proposal (not that I expect you to respond: You've not addressed
any of the other criticisms with the exception of calling for doubling
the workload when a multiple-choice option is desired):

If you expect any existing organization to adopt your alternative,
especially if that alternative *reduces* their power, you're
delusional. Any new system either stands alone or it will never be
more than a curiosity that will be forcefully shut down just as soon
as it gains any traction. Granted this makes the marketing problem
harder (you have to basically market "revolution" as a product, which
is a hard sell, especially to conservatives) and exposes us to the
risk of a messy transition (many states that already teeter on the
edge of totalitarianism will have to go there first). But if The
People want power, they're going to have to take it, not just beg the
existing power structure to voluntarily release it to them.

Subject: [MG] Need a new word
Message-ID: <CACobxW3gCgLWD0mavB8JO-34qtDdpkLqagUyyF-X9w_==gz0og@mail.gmail.com>

We need a new word. The definition is something like "The belief,
often implicit, that there is inherent value in behavior that evolved
to facilitate gene transmission". It's highly correlated with racism,
nationalism, protectionism, imperialism, tribalism, etc. and of course
with conservatism in general. But it also covers beliefs and behaviors
related to child rearing (i.e., children as possessions, inheritance,
high birth rates, etc.) insofar as it's clear that particular beliefs
and behaviors are designed not so much to promote the well-being of
the child or the parent, but merely to facilitate propagation of the
genes for which they are the vehicles (a la Dawkins' The Selfish
Gene): For example, adoption is rare in small-scale societies and in
most animal species because it specifically works *against* the
propagation of one's own genes. The new term would also would cover
acceptance of a large range of anti-social behaviors (discrimination,
violence, lying/cheating/stealing, etc.) that facilitated replication
of one's own genes over those of competitors during EEA.

It's sort of an antonym for humanism and rationalism, but applies at a
lower level (i.e., it applies to the genetics, not culture).
Curiously, there aren't any antonyms listed in the thesaurus for
either of those either, although I'd have listed "barbarism" and maybe
"spiritualism" in that category (What is the opposite of "humanism"?)

I'm aware that there are some Clinations that we will probably choose
to retain (parent/child bonding, expressions of romantic love,
competitiveness in general, etc.) that will be examples of this
concept, but the crucial distinction is that we will *choose* to
retain them rather than keep them merely as a result of some inherent
value we ascribe to them.

So far I've come up with propagism (or propism), replism
(replicationism?), and geneism (or genism), though the latter only
captures half of the meaning. Vestigialism also partially overlaps
with this concept but doesn't really capture the "value" part of it
(and vestigialism is barely a word itself, since there are only about
400 hits on google for it). Any other suggestions or root words we
should look at?

Message-ID: <CACobxW35yF=Ebsg-6yyN0MYxKePxygvoQB0=s6WrmoHcz05vMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Another data point for how this list is broken. The archive daemon
seems to be dead: If you view the messages by date the last few day's
messages aren't there:
http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2017-May/date.html

But the server is still sending out messages, and is archiving them in
the raw log:
http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2017-May.txt

Again, somebody should look at this, and if no one will we should
resume the debate about moving this domain to someplace where it will
be properly maintained or perhaps just abandoning it (no one seems to
be using the Wiki anymore anyway) and moving this list someplace else.

What are your perceptions on how to handle this contradiction then of
asking for a system to redefine how we organize and yet hoping that this
system can also cater to dictators? I know my model does not scale well for
dictators, very much a direct democracy. Do you think it's important to
justify the position of not allowing dictators ultimate control? Should I
adjust my proposal to allow for this feature? Something that would
contradict my view but fit the criteria. Or should I simply plow through
ignoring it and hope this aspect was more just thrown in there to appease
some people and ultimately it won't matter in the final decision?

To some extent this seems to me to be mostly a moral question: Is it
worth making changes to your model or somehow misrepresenting it
(e.g., by obscuring or omitting conflicting principles) in order to
"win", the idea being that the ends (the possibility of a better
society living under your system) justifies the means? I wouldn't rule
this out (it's human nature to do this and there is very little risk
of any sort of backlash), but it's not the route I'm going to take:
I'd rather have them realize the rules they've specified can't produce
a working system and so are just incompetent social engineering in
hopes they'll fix them for the next time they run the competition.

Assuming there is a next time: Based partly on Teo's negativity and my
general disillusionment with the MetaGovernment wiki I've spend a few
hours reviewing the linked projects and do find there is support for
Teo's position: This field is positively littered with failures and
otherwise abandoned projects. Worse, the peak seems to have long since
passed and there are very few new ones being proposed to keep any of
the ideas alive. This is sad in a way, but also good news for those of
us still persisting, especially if we're doing something different
from what's been tried before. In particular I find the obsession with
secret voting and working with existing government systems rather than
proposing to just replace them to be the social engineering equivalent
of volunteering to compete in a boxing match with one arm tied behind
your back.

I therefore plan to attack the GCF-rules issue head on, including a
strong argument about why any system that complies with their rules is
doomed to failure (albeit with millions to blow on the project it may
take 5-10 years for them to realize it) . This probably means I won't
win, but that's one less competitor for you all to worry about ;-) On
the other hand, maybe this is an opportunity: If we *all* complain
about the rules and ignore the one about being compatible with
governments run by dictators, maybe it will give all of us an
advantage over those proposals that restrict themselves to thinking
inside the box...

Another data point for anyone who may be looking into this MG mailing
list problem: That message I just posted came back to me with a flag
from Gmail "This may be a spoofed message. Gmail couldn't verify that
it was actually sent from your account." Curiously searching for that
phrase in Google only turns up a single link (how often does that
happen?), a google groups post that says this is probably due to

the list to someplace more invested in keeping up with current email

If you expect any existing organization to adopt your alternative,

delusional. Any new system either stands alone or it will never be

The source code for proxyfor.me has been released:
https://github.com/metamerman/proxyfor.me

Installation instructions included, and should be more complete than
anything else I've downloaded from GitHub: Most of those projects seem
to go out of their way to make actually building the packages obscure
and error prone, as if wasting a couple of hours on config issues is
some sort of test to assess whether or not you're actually worthy of
contributing. Proxyfor.me should only take half an hour for a novice
to set up the environment to build and run it, half that if you've
done that kind of thing before or already have some of the tools
installed.

For this group's purposes (validating matches and voting) the
interesting stuff is probably all at the top of db.ts. It's written in
TypeScript but because all my professional experience has been as a
C/C++ programmer it probably mostly looks like that and so should be
readable by anyone who knows those or any derivative language. You've
probably got to be a pretty hard-core MEAN stack programmer to
understand most of the rest of it, though.

Let me know if I've missed anything.

Not at all: They fail because they're way too much work. I also don't
believe in NWO/Illuminati/Deep State conspiracies, but I do understand
why people might be confused into thinking that those exist:
Oligarchies *do* exist, as do SDAP behavior patterns. They *are* the
ones with the real power in our societies and so dealing with this
issue has got to be a key component of any proposed new system. DD is
ideally suited solving these problem, though, so as long as we can
build one that doesn't require everyone to spend hours every day doing
public policy, all we really have to do is avoid the pitfalls (like
designing a system that relies on SDAP leadership voluntarily giving
up power).

There is something related to this in there, but
individualism/collectivism I tend to see as an orthogonal dimension to
what I'm talking about. What I'm trying to get at is the acceptable
*sources* of behavior, not its ultimate benefactor:

spiritualism/deism: you're supposed to abdicate control to god/fate

humanism: decisions should be made based on rationality but the
philosophy also relies on some sort of innate goodness

replism: it's OK to go with what your genes tell you to do

Replism is definitely not the same as individualism because protection
of the group and even sacrifice for the group is a common outcome
(tribalism). And humanism is not necessarily incompatible with
individualism either: individual achievement is certainly encouraged
by most humanists.

Spiritualism/deism is only selectively incompatible with replism with
rules coming from prophets and other amateur social engineers about
which replism-derived behaviors must be suppressed. The problem being
that those amateur social engineers are usually more concerned with
preserving their own power than in what's best for The People overall
and so they let things like replism-based tribalism run free and even
encourage it in many cases.

Humanism and replism are also only partially incompatible because
replism assumes these innate sources are naturally good whereas
humanism would at least impose some constraints based on rational
decisionmaking on them. Most Humanists do seem to assume that most of
these innate behaviors are "good", though, mostly I think because
humanists are just another variety of amateur social engineers and so
don't even consider all the ramifications of allowing each Clination
to be expressed unimpeded.

Matchism would therefore be classified between spiritualism/deism and
humanism: It takes from the former a definite concept that "good" is
to be defined independently of instinctive behavior and enforced by
establishing a set of rules (laws and policies) that people must
follow. It takes from the latter that the rules should be derived from
rational analysis (albeit collective rational analysis) rather than
the proclamations of amateur social engineer religious leaders.
Matchism doesn't make the assumption of innate goodness that humanism
(and even deism to some extent) relies on: Everything is subject to
negotiation depending on the environmental and technological
conditions under which the decisions will be made. It is therefore the
only philosophy that fully rejects the "innate good" aspect of
replism.

I think this means I'm settling on "replism" as the name for this
concept. What does "replism" mean to you?

Science fiction is often useful.

In one story, we did not be allowed to be "wild humans" (since we had
pretty much killed ourselves)

In another all rhe original style humans were kept in a planet sized zoo
and left not quite unsupervized.  I think we would call them heirloom
humans.  Not very nice but the winners really really knew they were the
best most flexible smartness most rurhless and unbeatable and also  knew
that just maybe they were wrong.

In any case I think you are ignoring data that human evolution has speeded
up at when we became civilized.  Even without GMO humans and without
considering lamarcism influences, the selection pressure is intense.

It's sad because I can think of antonyms for humanist, but the most fitting
one, fascism, is already so damn misunderstood/loaded I think we might be
better off just creating one. A-humanist? Inhumanist?

The inhumanity principle was coined by jeffers.  He is usually called a
fascist but more an isolationist and a deeply distrustful person concerning
civilization.  Personally, I doubt that he held a high opinion of any
extant or even archaic political system in the last ten millenia.  That he
is sensibe we can note that few of those political systems are successful.

I enjoyed his poetry.  Would that the only political commentary must need
be in rhyme

I see replism as an abstract form of survivalism, I consider most succesful
system as proof that survivalism is the key to create a continuum.
As tecnology shift and ICT become mature survivalist are the one that are
better in being able to adapt. And they are searching for solution
Politically is just a matter of sufficient means to survive in the short
term, while a survivalist plan the long term. Survivalist can shift from
fascist to leftist, to centeright ect.ect. but they are looking to give
answers to solve problem.
Once survivalist will "take over", and I belive will eventually happen.
then a new era will begin. They will implement sostenibilism as a rule and
all decision will become entangled in the process. I believe that the new
era will become a reality, but maybe I will not be here to see it happen.
Am I a dreamer?
peace

Just to show you how weird Boulder is, the local paper actually
published the Guest Opinion I sent them (albeit a few weeks ago):
http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_31017240/scott-raney-defense-social-engineering

I don't think this is a good general-purpose PR strategy, but it does
show that there are people out there willing to consider a new way of
doing things. It's mainly a matter of figuring out how to find them.
Once we get rolling word-of-mouth should carry us the rest of the
way...

Hmm: it seems survivalist has a completely different meaning here in
the US. Here a survivalist, often called a "prepper", is someone
preparing for the end of civilization (guns, bunkers, long-term food
storage, developing hunting and fighting skills, hording gold, etc.)

"sostenibilism" is another problematic term: There doesn't seem to be
any English equivalent for that, but it seems to translate to being a
proponent of sustainable economics.

But it looks to me like the opposite is happening: The left,
especially in the US, is dying and as I said a few posts ago there are
very few people actively working on new ideas or systems to replace
those that arose out of the civil rights and antiwar movements of the
1960s. Trump's inability to function I think will push the pendulum
back toward that a bit (e.g. Fox News has fallen behind both CNN and
MSNBC for the first time), but overall the movement seems to be toward
nationalism (tribalism) just about everywhere. You may not live to see
the new order, but unfortunately you (we) may all live long enough to
experience the chaos that will lead to it...

I just discovered Mussolini's manifesto, which I hadn't run across
before. Not a great piece of work (maybe a bad translation?) but I
think it is worth dissecting:
http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm

It certainly fits with your claim of it being anti-humanist, at least
so far as it applies to the cultural/political level. In a sense
fascism is a derivative of replism at least as far as you could claim
that the social and organizational directives of replism that
benefited genes in the EEA still apply in the modern world. That
manifesto even treads into social engineering territory a bit, with a
strong prescription for conditioning to ensure that The People are
properly shaped cogs to be working components in the fascist machine.

Unfortunately it's less useful when you try to apply it to individual
behavior that doesn't directly relate to support for the State. For
example, that manifesto contains strong support for religion
(Catholicism) but primarily as an organizational tool, not as a source
of moral code. To the extent the chosen religion conflicts with the
needs of the State, the religion is the one that would have to change.
To the extent that it's directives don't concern an individual's
relationship to the State, *any* religion would work as an organizing
mechanism. In that sense fascism is agnostic WRT the source of a moral
code that would apply to relationships between people rather than
between the individual and the state.

That manifesto has a lot of confusing, contradictory, and even
provably wrong things in it, though. I had to laugh at this one, for
example, which is a weak (and totally wrong) analysis of what is
sometimes called "group selection theory":
"The maxim that society exists only for the well-being and freedom of
the individuals composing it does not seem to be in conformity with
nature's plans, which care only for the species and seem ready to
sacrifice the individual."

I also had to scratch my head at the coining of the term
"authoritarian democracy", which is possibly an oxymoron but at the
very least is not at all the decisionmaking system he seems to be
proposing: Fascism as he describes it, and as it has always been
implemented, is a form of oligarchy, not democracy.

But back to the main topic: I don't think fascism is the opposite of
humanism. In fact if you read the humanist manifesto, there's only
thing in there that is actually directly contradictory to fascism
(humanism contains a prohibition on violence whereas fascism would
seem to endorse the use of violence against targets outside the
State):
https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/manifesto3/

This I think says more about the amateur social engineering
foundations of humanism than anything about its relationship to
fascism. It's an exclusive (as opposed to inclusive) philosophy
because it lacks any mention of individual differences (some of which
cause people to have different goals and to exhibit behavior
incompatible with the "rules"), the source or source of control over
individual behavior (i.e. who decides what is "good", and how, and
what are the consequences of failing to do "good"), any specificity
about the form of government or decisionmaking, or what the Goals of
the People should be, how they should be determined, and what
compromises are allowed in achieving them. Mussolini's fascism at
least takes a stab at all of these things, even though in most cases
it's SDAPs that end up making the decisions to suit themselves (as
"Democratic Authoritarians", I guess ;-)

But can you make a useful prediction about what changes are occurring
and what effect that will have on the optimal system for human
government? My theory is that things are getting worse WRT
oligarchy/misrepresentative democracy/dictatorship because selection
pressures that would have eliminated problematic individuals
(particularly SDAPs) from the population are no longer operating
(psychopaths in particular probably rarely reached adulthood 10,000
years ago). And the reproductive success of some of these individuals
is astounding: For example it's been reported that 10% of men in
Mongolia carry Genghis Khan's Y-chromosome. An interesting related
fact is that the murder rate in Mongolia is almost 10 times that of
China...

Man I could not agree more.

With each other their "solutions" we're just reading more about how
bio-regionalism is cool or something, they're clearly not committed to
enacting any serious plans or even discussing content they post.

Why're these people even here? Do they actually believe in what they're

At least in theory what they're funding is actual
development/deployment rather than handwaving, the specialty of the
Next System Project. But I'm having a little trouble conceiving of a
system that would meet their criteria, the sticking point being that
the system has to work with dictators as major participants (because
they rule out changing local decisionmaking as part of the process).
This always leads me back to coercive techniques, something that as a
social engineer I generally reject as being ineffective in the long
term because they create large incentives to invest in ways of gaming
the system. As such I'm starting to consider the Global Challenges
Prize as an exercise in developing barn-door-closing mechanisms that
work after the horse has already bolted.

The discovery by me of the Rojava region and the "libertarian municipalism"
 and the possibility  to extend such system using a internet decisional

Yeah, right: A "revolution" that's a few years old and which governs a
population the size of a small city is a shining beacon? I think you
would be far better served studying how the soviet system, which
started out a lot like Rojava, eventually failed when the SDAPs
transitioned it to totalitarianism. "libertarian municipalism" is just
another variant of the same kind of amateur social engineering we've
seen repeatedly fail: You either understand how psychopaths create and
control hierarchies or you repeat the mistakes of the past.

> Looks like hardship always brings out the best from humans.

Sure, but it also brings out the psychopaths: Hitler, Mao, Stalin, and
Pol Pot *all* came to power exactly because the people were
experiencing severe resource deprivation and so were inspired to
revolution. Taking this as a lesson will only result in you creating a
system that psychopaths will use to exploit The People. For example,
you can learn a lot more about "cooperatives" by studying how the
Soviets and the Asian communists figured out how to exploit them than
by studying some fresh new example that only hasn't had time to
promote a psychopath that has figured out how to game that particular
system.

Hi,

I am still working on the comparison of systems, I am calling it now
epistemology of constitutional design (or prediction of goodness)

the important words in it are "epistemologic strength"
nice example you will find in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine

and some variations of
constitutional (electoral) design (engineering)

Cheers
m.

I definitely hear what you're both saying about hardship, it's one hell of
a double edged sword isn't it?


 I get a good feeling about this Lazslow guy. He saw what ethnic violence
looks like as a kid when he had to flee his own country, and through his
experience in business has seen how necessary this kind of work really is.

He published his book for free online, and the very style of it suggests to
me he's a man trying to leave a legacy his descendants can respect. It's
not 'intellectualist' or elite at all, he basically squeezed a lifetime of
UN analysis into a roughly 100 page book about the
scientifically-established threats to humanity, written in plain English.

He does mention one of the problems as an excess in state sovereignty, and
openly proposes globalism, but only because he sees self-interest as a
threat to world peace. And he's very open about that. I personally agree we
should have a few strong international agreements in place to ensure
countries can take responsible measures without seeing their businesses
just move to shittier countries so they can abuse people and pollute out
there.

I think it's a good read, here's a link to it if anyone wants.

SDAP find potential threats to expansion extremely undesireable.  On the
other hand, self interest is hardly undesireable.  None of this suggest
democracy as an influence on foreign policy is particularly desireable. On
the other hand, our elites are often remarkedly blind.  Maybe We SHOUlD Fix
Our elITES

Interesting. There is a lot of work in constitutional comparisons, with
whole university courses and chairs on this topic. Are you looking into it?

It's a good list of proximate problems, and at least doesn't include
handwaving about things like "income inequality" or other red
herrings. Of course I also believe that he's missed the true
underlying cause, and you see it in his repeated expressions of
deference to "politicians" and "leaders". It's ironic, and a little
surprising that he cites Einstein at the start of Chapter 6: ?We can?t
solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we
created them" and yet blindly plows on assuming the next system will
be structured almost exactly the same as our current system with a
hierarchy of politicians who we will have to trust to make decisions
for us...

Certainly props due for the attempt, but is publishing this paper
really part of the process of solving any of the problems discussed in
it? I.e., is the problem simply that we don't know these things, or is
it really that we have no decisionmaking system capable of actually
dealing with any of them?

True, but he also specifically rules out any changes to existing
political boundaries because "This is impractical because there are
simply too many and too
great differences among nations? languages, cultures, economies and
political systems." Which IMHO is factually inaccurate (what is the
EU, chopped liver?!?). It's also a recipe for failure, something he
later even directly acknowledges:

"Leaders of undemocratic nations, who place
their own personal interests above those of their people, would
naturally be on the list of losers. That list would also include
politicians who strive for special positions of power, for their
nations or themselves."

Which is a fatal flaw in his proposal: Does he actually expect
dictators and other authoritarian states to volunteer to become
"losers"? If not, then the entire proposal is unworkable because it
*requires* this to happen, and yet "voluntarily" (no wars, no defense
budgets, etc.)

But will international agreements written and then approved by
politicians have any chance of achieving this? We The People I think
could do this, but IMHO we'll have to do it ourselves.

I agree it's worth reading, especially if you plan to enter the
competition. But I also think it's important to understand that there
are large loopholes and unsupported assumptions, some of which are
even unstated, in the paper that you'll have to deal with (or exploit,
depending on your requirements ;-)

That there are missing bits is understandable given that's it's
primarily intended as a call to action rather than as a specific
social engineering design. The latter is our job to provide ;-)

True, but also threats to their own power and prestige.

Agreed. It's the engine that drives evolution, and also capitalism.
It's as natural to us as breathing.

Or replace them. IMHO they're mostly unfixable because even if they
could somehow figure out how to represent us, they wouldn't do it
anyway because they're just not that kind of people. I have no
delusion that https://www.proxyfor.me/ is not just another elite-based
system, but at least the elites will be selected from the entire
population rather than just from the subset who have a will to
political power...

Much more complete than the last time I reviewed it. Unfortunately,
now I have a bunch of new criticisms ;-)
1) I repeat my criticism of last time that the "listicle" at the
beginning is not only not necessary, but counterproductive. Everybody
already knows how screwed up our current systems are, but
unfortunately they all disagree as to exactly *how*. This
Chomsky-esque list is going to be a huge turnoff for conservatives,
for example, and if you lose them, your entire system loses legitimacy
as a platform suitable for representing *all* The People.

2) The political party requirement is a non-starter IMHO for the same
reason: You can't allow bundling people together who all agree on some
subset of issues because by doing so you're eliminating the majority
of people who don't agree on the "party platform" for those issues.
Again, legitimacy goes away when you do this.

3) I considered and rejected the multiple choice option for individual
issues because there is no practical way to combine votes into
majority opinion in most cases. It fails even in your "death penalty"
example: What is the decision if equal numbers of people choose each
option?

4) Of course it also doesn't deal with the SDAP/activert
participation-rate issue, the one issue I believe is the key to
success and the one thing that https://www.proxyfor.me/ handles
properly that no other system that I've heard of does.

5) Your delegation system can't work any better than the Liquid
Feedback system which the data clearly showed failed miserably to
properly represent the people. Again, only the proxyfor.me design
(i.e., automatic delegate/proxy assignment) can reliably do this
AFAIK.

I'd therefore recommend you follow your own suggestion WRT
collaboration and figure out what, if anything, is wrong with
proxyfor.me and help fix that instead of proceeding with implementing
this proposal. The "real world" has kept me very busy the past few
weeks and so I haven't had time to do much work on the next phase of
proxyfor.me: marketing (the technical parts all seem to be working
well, and with pleasingly low CPU and bandwidth requirements). But
things look to be opening up for me in a couple/few weeks and I look
forward to getting any suggestions any of you may have as to how to
get people to start signing up and using this new system.

    Scott

Everything I have written is the truth and facts are easily checkable in the net

Assuming we have hundreds or thousands of votes, how frequently can we have exactly the same number of votes for 2 different options?

REPLY)  Ah, here we go..
You took the time to write a reply to me only as a sneaky way to promote your little system
So sad.
Anyway, I will have a look at it, even if it looks to me as it will never work
Same as the Airesis group, Pietro di Fenizio, the guys of Votorola you seem to be driven by your gigantic ego and looking at the software of your own dreams instead of looking at what people need
And therefore, yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/  is deemed to fail
I predicted the failure of Votorola and I was right
I predicted the failure of Airesis (just ask Jacopo and Marino) and I was right
I predicted nobody would use Vilfredo and I was right
I now predict that nobody will use yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/
Too complicated

5) Your delegation system can't work any better than the Liquid
Feedback system which the data clearly showed failed miserably to
properly represent the people. Again, only the proxyfor.me design
(i.e., automatic delegate/proxy assignment) can reliably do this

REPLY)
My delegation system has nothing to do with Liquid Feedback and Liquid Feedback failed for internal strives and not for the delevation system

I'd therefore recommend you follow your own suggestion WRT
collaboration and figure out what, if anything, is wrong with
proxyfor.me and help fix that instead of proceeding with implementing
this proposal[..more self promotion..]
REPLY)
I will work with any software, any one, which is simple and easy to use and I predict will be used by the masses
Your software is just driven by your gigantic ego and will fail
Like Liquid Feedback
Like Airesis
Like Votorola
Like Vilfredo

There's a reason I never said his book is the answer, his book is about the
need for an answer, from a reputable source. That's just one of the
elements we need as solution builders to make this thing happen.

Matteo this kind of answer really turn me off, because it is not in any way
educate to address other opinion as stupid or criticize someone to promote
their own project.

Objection to the statement "how frequently". It is probably  not frequent
that someone win the lottery but sure someone do.

Now let me tell you that if you consider proxyfor.me too complicate i doubt
in your intelligence, so far the proxy vote that the system have given
match my vote so I see it as a promising addendum to a collaborative
proposal making software. In the same way I see Vilfredo as potential
method for collaborative paragraph editing of a proposal making software.
Voting multiple choice is not considered in proxyfor.me so far so the
voting in Airesis can be used where this may be necessary.
There is not a single "way" to address world problem and IMHO there will
never be one, but a network of interlaced and integrated intelligent
methods is the answer.
Peace

Assuming we have hundreds or thousands of votes, how frequently can we
have exactly the same number of votes for 2 different options?

REPLY)  Ah, here we go..
You took the time to write a reply to me only as a sneaky way to
promote your little system
So sad.
Anyway, I will have a look at it, even if it looks to me as it will never work
Same as the Airesis group, Pietro di Fenizio, the guys of Votorola you
seem to be driven by your gigantic ego and looking at the software of
your own dreams instead of looking at what people need
And therefore, your https://www.proxyfor.me/ is deemed to fail
I predicted the failure of Votorola and I was right
I predicted the failure of Airesis (just ask Jacopo and Marino) and I
was right
I predicted nobody would use Vilfredo and I was right
I now predict that nobody will use your https://www.proxyfor.me/
Too complicated

5) Your delegation system can't work any better than the Liquid
Feedback system which the data clearly showed failed miserably to
properly represent the people. Again, only the proxyfor.me design
(i.e., automatic delegate/proxy assignment) can reliably do this
AFAIK.
REPLY)
My delegation system has nothing to do with Liquid Feedback and Liquid
Feedback failed for internal strives and not for the delevation system

I'd therefore recommend you follow your own suggestion WRT
collaboration and figure out what, if anything, is wrong
withproxyfor.me and help fix that instead of proceeding with
implementing
this proposal[..more self promotion..]
REPLY)
I will work with any software, any one, which is simple and easy to
use and I predict will be used by the masses
Your software is just driven by your gigantic ego and will fail
Like Liquid Feedback
Like Airesis
Like Votorola
Like Vilfredo

My wife and I were actually talking about this WRT marketing just last
night: The easiest way to get something unfamiliar adopted by people
who don't have the time or inclination to explore is to have a
celebrity endorse it. It's a Clination, to be sure, but in my opinion
as a social engineer one that we should be actively working to
suppress (in my experience celebrities model bad behavior more often
than good, and many of them are just manipulating psychopaths). That
said, I'm inclined to use "the ends justifies the means" rule,
particularly since the "means" are techniques that people are already
being manipulated by on a vast scale (i.e., advertising) and so one
more instance can't do them any significant additional harm...

This is a textbook example of an ad-hominem attack: If you lack the
facts or intellectual chops to criticize a proposal, criticize the
person who promotes it.

And I note that you didn't respond to any of the specific criticisms:
*That* is the real recipe for failure.

Really, I'm doing him a huge favor: Taking the time to read and find
the flaws (and pointing out how some other system doesn't have them)
is the best way to help the creator make it better. IMHO the cruelest
thing is to allow people to continue to waste time on something that
you can easily find the flaws in that they seem to be blind to.

Yeah, and it's not about frequency anyway: There's just no way to do
Condorcet-type combinations on things like his "Death Penalty"
example. The only reason techniques like that *appear* to work when
choosing representatives is because misrepresentative government is so
bad at "representing" us that we consider even getting it marginally
better a big improvement.

Agreed, and we learn as much from seeing what *doesn't* work in the
various projects as we gain by "borrowing" the best parts. That paper
describing the failure of the LQFB delegation system I consider to be
the single greatest influence in my conception of how direct democracy
can be implemented.

Spoken as someone who has an agenda *other* than implementing
democracy: Your statements may indeed be factual (though I suspect
that most contain at least exaggerations if not outright falsehoods),
but again make it clear that your agenda is reigning in the US and
other superpowers, not doing anything for The People. They're just
tools for you to use in achieving your goals. This is exactly the kind
of thinking that brought us Mao and Stalin.

Please read your proposal again, specifically item 2.1, 4, 9, and 22.
Did you even write this thing?

You missed the point: Your death penalty example (#15) has 7 possible
responses. How do you combine votes for each of them to reach a
decision?

I submit you have it exactly backwards: At least we're comfortable

I think again you're missing the point: The delegation system in LQFB
*didn't* work and therefore was a deal breaker for the adoption of the

Hi all,

thank you for your answers, despite I see many people disagreeing with 
me here

The newsletter system is not, IMHO, the best system to work with as it 
is quite difficult to quote someone in a clear and easy way

This said, I will reply in one mail to criticisms by both Jacopo and Scott

1)

Spoken as someone who has an agenda *other* than implementing
democracy: Your statements may indeed be factual (though I suspect
that most contain at least exaggerations if not outright falsehoods),
but again make it clear that your agenda is reigning in the US and
other superpowers, not doing anything for The People. They're just
tools for you to use in achieving your goals. This is exactly the kind
of thinking that brought us Mao and Stalin. (by Scott)
=>  My statements are factual and you can check any of them in Wikipedia.
I have no agenda reigning in anyone. I just stated facts.
I criticized mostly the US and the West as, IMHO, they are the richest and most powerful people on the planet so they have the moral duty to behave well.
Islamic terrorists and crimes by Russians and Chinese have also be pointed out when they commit crimes
Telling me that the desire to pointing out war crimes and to promote direct democracy is the kind of thinking that brought us Mao and Stalin is an utterly moronic statement
In fact, one of the most moronic statements I have heard in my life (and I have heard many of them)

2)
This is a textbook example of an ad-hominem attack: If you lack the
facts or intellectual chops to criticize a proposal, criticize the
person who promotes it.
And I note that you didn't respond to any of the specific criticisms:
*That*  is the real recipe for failure.  (by Scott)

=>  I criticized the proposals for one single reason: they failed
Airesis failed. This is a fact. Nobody really uses Airesis today. It 
failed, Simple as that. Money, time and resources all wasted, so far.
Vilfredo failed. Same reason above
Am I attacking someone by saying the facts? I do not think so.
I also replied to your criticisms for as much as I could

3)

Really, I'm doing him a huge favor: Taking the time to read and find
the flaws (and pointing out how some other system doesn't have them)
is the best way to help the creator make it better. IMHO the cruelest
thing is to allow people to continue to waste time on something that
you can easily find the flaws in that they seem to be blind to.
(by Scott)
->  Thank you for the favour, but let me ask you..
If you know the flaws of the systems well, why have not you promoted a successful direct democracy system so far?
You have been here much longer than me, and you are talking with many people.
More than me.
If you are so smart to find the flaws in my system, can you please tell me how many governments and/or organizations are using yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/?
Your system is already online, the one I am proposing is just an idea.
So there should be already tens if not hundreds of governments interested in working with you today.
Can you tell me who they are?
Since you are talking and discussing with Jacopo, Pietro and others, and they too have been promoting DD systems for years, could you tell me who is using any of their systems?
Airesis took years and the work of many many people to be brought to life. How many people are using it in the government today?
I have been hearing about Vilfredo for years. Same question

4)
Yeah, and it's not about frequency anyway: There's just no way to do
Condorcet-type combinations on things like his "Death Penalty"
example. The only reason techniques like that*appear*  to work when
choosing representatives is because misrepresentative government is so
bad at "representing" us that we consider even getting it marginally
better a big improvement.  (by Scott)

->  I am looking for marginally better improvements.
There are usually the ones which work.
I would not ask Pietro and Jacopo and you for designing the best system that solves ALL the problems in the world as you have all tried to do so
And failed
And you have yet to understand this simple point, apparently.
So I set the bar for any system a little bit lower
As I do not like failures

5)
Agreed, and we learn as much from seeing what*doesn't*  work in the
various projects as we gain by "borrowing" the best parts. That paper
describing the failure of the LQFB delegation system I consider to be
the single greatest influence in my conception of how direct democracy
can be implemented.  (by Scott)

->  You are talking about your own system again here.
Fine with that.
How many people are using it today?
Millions? Not yet?
Thousands? Not yet?
Hundreds? Not yet?
I hereby officially predict how many people will be using your system one, five and ten years from now.
Reply: Zero
Why I say so?
As it is too complicated and too unnecessarily complicated
People will never use it

6)
Please read your proposal again, specifically item 2.1, 4, 9, and 22.
Did you even write this thing?
(by Scott)

-> I also wrote that a political party may not be needed at the beginning

7)
You missed the point: Your death penalty example (#15) has 7 possible
responses. How do you combine votes for each of them to reach a
decision?
(by Scott)

->  You do not
You just take the two responses who got the largest number of votes and have a vote on those two
Simple as that.
Got the word?
Simple

8)
No, but given that mine came before yours you should at least be
familiar with it before spouting off. Clearly you're not.
(by Scott)
->  I started this thread speaking about a proposed system which is not yours and you used the replies in this thread to write the URL of your system quite a few times so far
Fine with that, I am not jealous
Now, let me ask you
Since as you have pointed out you have been here longer than me, please tell me how many governments/organizations are using your software (which is already in beta stage) now.
Or even consider doing it
Is it 1000?
Is it 100?
Is it 10?
Is it 1?
Is it noone?

9)
I submit you have it exactly backwards: At least we're comfortable
with turning control over to the People. Until you get rid of the
screed that makes up the first half of your proposal it appears to be
more about how to manipulate them into achieving the outcomes*you*
specify.
(by Scott)
-> I just stated facts
Plain facts and the reasons why I believe it is important to be engaged with DD
If people do not like facts, this is their problem
Not mine

10)
Says the guy who hasn't invested even a few minutes to understand how
it works...
(by Scott)
->  Slowly but surely you are getting there
I DO NOT want to invest more than 5 minutes to read your proposal as PEOPLE will not spend more than 5 minutes to read your proposal
Why is it so difficult to understand?
People in general are not ego-driven guys who are looking to have the best system in the world
They just need something simple which works
This is why your complicated system will fail
Same as Airesis
Same as Vilfredo
Same as Votorola
Same as LQFB

11)
I think again you're missing the point: The delegation system in LQFB
*didn't*  work and therefore was a deal breaker for the adoption of the
system. If a system really does manage to capture The Will of The
People no amount of conflict in the SDAP leadership of the movement
will be able to stop it.
(by Scott)
-> This is your opinion. I respect but disagree with it.
At least we can agree that LQFB failed. As Airesis and as Vilfredo

12)
Matteo this kind of answer really turn me off, because it is not in any way
educate to address other opinion as stupid or criticize someone to promote
their own project.
(by Jacopo)
  ->  Well, I always prefer to be honest and straightforward than to be false.
We discussed this before with you, I think. And I did not call anyone as stupid here

13)  Objection to the statement "how frequently". It is probably  not frequent
that someone win the lottery but sure someone do.
(by Jacopo)
  ->  True
But you do not take a huge loan on the grounds that one day you may win the lottery and pay it off, right?
And exceptions like having two proposals with the exact number of votes can always be handled somehow
Right?

14)
Now let me tell you that if you consider proxyfor.me too complicate i doubt
in your intelligence, so far the proxy vote that the system have given
match my vote so I see it as a promising addendum to a collaborative
proposal making software.
(by Jacopo)
->  Please be welcome and doubt of my intelligence!! :)
Along with the intelligence of 100% of the world population who is not using proxyforme and never will

That's a problem with your mail program, not email lists in general.

Yeah, that's a bad idea too: You should respond to messages as they

And if I claim that you're an idiot that doesn't have any idea what
you're doing, that may be a fact too but it certainly doesn't advance
the case of any of us understanding exactly how and why you fail to
understand why your proposal is generating this response, nor help us
decide what to do about it. Your agenda is revealed by the examples
you provide, which aren't examples of the failure of government
decisionmaking, but rather failures of SDAP personalities in
decisionmaking positions. And then you fail to even deal with that
issue by creating a party and and a new "elite" that will apparently
be responsible for the actual decisionmaking because The People can't
be bothered to spend 5 minutes researching an issue before voting on
it.

That is not a criticism, that's merely a statement of your opinion. A
valid criticism would include an analysis of *why* they failed.

Umm, I'm working on it: proxyfor.me was just recently released for
beta test and as yet has no marketing plan. I also haven't finished
the open-source release yet which is something I need to get done
before I can actually promote it as an open source project which is I
consider to be an essential feature of any new public policy
decisionmaking system.

> ->  I am looking for marginally better improvements.

And yet you've proposed nothing that is even marginally better than
anything that has come before, nor even demonstrated that you
understand *why* any of the other systems "failed" (as you call it).
Just a few data points to put the timeframe of adoption process of
things like this in perspective:
It was 60 years between the publication of the "Communist Manifesto"
and the Bolshevik revolution
The number of Christians didn't break 10000 until over a hundred years
after Jesus died
The American Colonies were established (and immediately began feuding
with the Brits) 170 years before the American Revolution

I.e., it's way too early to call any of the projects you cite as failures...

Lord help us if they're all as thick-headed and superficial as you,
but fortunately proxyfor.me will work to provide good representation
even if 99.99% of the population turns out to be this way. How does
your system provide this?

It's not an opinion that the LQFB delegation system didn't work, it's
a fact (read the paper). And your delegation system works exactly the
same way: Why won't it fail in exactly the same way?

Hi Scott

And if I claim that you're an idiot that doesn't have any idea what
you're doing, that may be a fact too but it certainly doesn't advance
the case of any of us understanding exactly how and why you fail to
understand why your proposal is generating this response, nor help us
decide what to do about it.

-> I see we are rapidly advancing to the point of insulting each other
I have no interest in taking part to this discussion
Airesis failed as noone is using it today
No government, no major institution
If the goal of a platform is to be used for DD and it is not being used, this is a failure
If you think that Airesis, or proxyforme will be successful in 60 years, good luck with it.
People with problems today need solutions today, not in 60 years
In 60 years or more you will not be here probably nor me
I have now memorized your mail in my agenda
If we will both be here in 2018, I will write you on the 1st of July 2018 a mail
In this mail there will be a question, the question is "why no major institution is using your software"?
You will then claim that the people were bad, the governments were bad, etc etc.
Like every other person does as they do not want to understand why they are failing.
Remember my words.
I have said the same words to Nicola Giulietti in 2011, to Ed and to everybody else
They wasted time and money for nothing
Look at where is Votorola today:  http://reluk.ca/project/votorola/genealogy.xht
Look at where is Airesis today
Ask Jacopo Tolja how many times I have told him they were on the wrong path
They did not listen and they had to close the project after having invested years or work and tens of thousands of $
How sad.
And now some of them is blaming the evil govenrment who is allegedly boycotting the project
How sad..
I believe there WILL be soon a DD system that will be widely used, as soon as some one does not daydream like you and the rest of the people
And creates something useful and easy

After that, I have nothing else to say
After all, the time you are wasting is only yours
You are living in the zone, my friend..
Just do not become sad or angry against the world when you will see that your project has failed

It is worth calling out this assumption as another fatal problem with
your proposal (not that I expect you to respond: You've not addressed
any of the other criticisms with the exception of calling for doubling
the workload when a multiple-choice option is desired):

If you expect any existing organization to adopt your alternative,
especially if that alternative *reduces* their power, you're
delusional. Any new system either stands alone or it will never be
more than a curiosity that will be forcefully shut down just as soon
as it gains any traction. Granted this makes the marketing problem
harder (you have to basically market "revolution" as a product, which
is a hard sell, especially to conservatives) and exposes us to the
risk of a messy transition (many states that already teeter on the
edge of totalitarianism will have to go there first). But if The
People want power, they're going to have to take it, not just beg the
existing power structure to voluntarily release it to them.

Subject: [MG] Need a new word
Message-ID: <CACobxW3gCgLWD0mavB8JO-34qtDdpkLqagUyyF-X9w_==gz0og@mail.gmail.com>

We need a new word. The definition is something like "The belief,
often implicit, that there is inherent value in behavior that evolved
to facilitate gene transmission". It's highly correlated with racism,
nationalism, protectionism, imperialism, tribalism, etc. and of course
with conservatism in general. But it also covers beliefs and behaviors
related to child rearing (i.e., children as possessions, inheritance,
high birth rates, etc.) insofar as it's clear that particular beliefs
and behaviors are designed not so much to promote the well-being of
the child or the parent, but merely to facilitate propagation of the
genes for which they are the vehicles (a la Dawkins' The Selfish
Gene): For example, adoption is rare in small-scale societies and in
most animal species because it specifically works *against* the
propagation of one's own genes. The new term would also would cover
acceptance of a large range of anti-social behaviors (discrimination,
violence, lying/cheating/stealing, etc.) that facilitated replication
of one's own genes over those of competitors during EEA.

It's sort of an antonym for humanism and rationalism, but applies at a
lower level (i.e., it applies to the genetics, not culture).
Curiously, there aren't any antonyms listed in the thesaurus for
either of those either, although I'd have listed "barbarism" and maybe
"spiritualism" in that category (What is the opposite of "humanism"?)

I'm aware that there are some Clinations that we will probably choose
to retain (parent/child bonding, expressions of romantic love,
competitiveness in general, etc.) that will be examples of this
concept, but the crucial distinction is that we will *choose* to
retain them rather than keep them merely as a result of some inherent
value we ascribe to them.

So far I've come up with propagism (or propism), replism
(replicationism?), and geneism (or genism), though the latter only
captures half of the meaning. Vestigialism also partially overlaps
with this concept but doesn't really capture the "value" part of it
(and vestigialism is barely a word itself, since there are only about
400 hits on google for it). Any other suggestions or root words we
should look at?

    Scott

What are your perceptions on how to handle this contradiction then of
asking for a system to redefine how we organize and yet hoping that this
system can also cater to dictators? I know my model does not scale well for
dictators, very much a direct democracy. Do you think it's important to
justify the position of not allowing dictators ultimate control? Should I
adjust my proposal to allow for this feature? Something that would
contradict my view but fit the criteria. Or should I simply plow through
ignoring it and hope this aspect was more just thrown in there to appease
some people and ultimately it won't matter in the final decision?

To some extent this seems to me to be mostly a moral question: Is it
worth making changes to your model or somehow misrepresenting it
(e.g., by obscuring or omitting conflicting principles) in order to
"win", the idea being that the ends (the possibility of a better
society living under your system) justifies the means? I wouldn't rule
this out (it's human nature to do this and there is very little risk
of any sort of backlash), but it's not the route I'm going to take:
I'd rather have them realize the rules they've specified can't produce
a working system and so are just incompetent social engineering in
hopes they'll fix them for the next time they run the competition.

Assuming there is a next time: Based partly on Teo's negativity and my
general disillusionment with the MetaGovernment wiki I've spend a few
hours reviewing the linked projects and do find there is support for
Teo's position: This field is positively littered with failures and
otherwise abandoned projects. Worse, the peak seems to have long since
passed and there are very few new ones being proposed to keep any of
the ideas alive. This is sad in a way, but also good news for those of
us still persisting, especially if we're doing something different
from what's been tried before. In particular I find the obsession with
secret voting and working with existing government systems rather than
proposing to just replace them to be the social engineering equivalent
of volunteering to compete in a boxing match with one arm tied behind
your back.

I therefore plan to attack the GCF-rules issue head on, including a
strong argument about why any system that complies with their rules is
doomed to failure (albeit with millions to blow on the project it may
take 5-10 years for them to realize it) . This probably means I won't
win, but that's one less competitor for you all to worry about ;-) On
the other hand, maybe this is an opportunity: If we *all* complain
about the rules and ignore the one about being compatible with
governments run by dictators, maybe it will give all of us an
advantage over those proposals that restrict themselves to thinking
inside the box...

    Scott

Another data point for anyone who may be looking into this MG mailing
list problem: That message I just posted came back to me with a flag
from Gmail "This may be a spoofed message. Gmail couldn't verify that
it was actually sent from your account." Curiously searching for that
phrase in Google only turns up a single link (how often does that
happen?), a google groups post that says this is probably due to

Subject: [MG] proxyfor.me source code released!
Message-ID: <CACobxW0Hndyyhm0uptkLROTkrghoRK7-3KPYW62A9PHovnXnBA@mail.gmail.com>

The source code for proxyfor.me has been released:
https://github.com/metamerman/proxyfor.me

Installation instructions included, and should be more complete than
anything else I've downloaded from GitHub: Most of those projects seem
to go out of their way to make actually building the packages obscure
and error prone, as if wasting a couple of hours on config issues is
some sort of test to assess whether or not you're actually worthy of
contributing. Proxyfor.me should only take half an hour for a novice
to set up the environment to build and run it, half that if you've
done that kind of thing before or already have some of the tools
installed.

For this group's purposes (validating matches and voting) the
interesting stuff is probably all at the top of db.ts. It's written in
TypeScript but because all my professional experience has been as a
C/C++ programmer it probably mostly looks like that and so should be
readable by anyone who knows those or any derivative language. You've
probably got to be a pretty hard-core MEAN stack programmer to
understand most of the rest of it, though.

Let me know if I've missed anything.
  Regards,
     Scott

Not at all: They fail because they're way too much work. I also don't
believe in NWO/Illuminati/Deep State conspiracies, but I do understand
why people might be confused into thinking that those exist:
Oligarchies *do* exist, as do SDAP behavior patterns. They *are* the
ones with the real power in our societies and so dealing with this
issue has got to be a key component of any proposed new system. DD is
ideally suited solving these problem, though, so as long as we can
build one that doesn't require everyone to spend hours every day doing
public policy, all we really have to do is avoid the pitfalls (like
designing a system that relies on SDAP leadership voluntarily giving
up power).

Well.  I think this is not Oranges issue.  For some reason, Ed got a deal
by becoming a reseller and saying he would take care of those details for
his clients.  Anyway that is sort of what I remember.

I think the deal was  FREE as in beer

There is something related to this in there, but
individualism/collectivism I tend to see as an orthogonal dimension to
what I'm talking about. What I'm trying to get at is the acceptable
*sources* of behavior, not its ultimate benefactor:

spiritualism/deism: you're supposed to abdicate control to god/fate

humanism: decisions should be made based on rationality but the
philosophy also relies on some sort of innate goodness

replism: it's OK to go with what your genes tell you to do

Replism is definitely not the same as individualism because protection
of the group and even sacrifice for the group is a common outcome
(tribalism). And humanism is not necessarily incompatible with
individualism either: individual achievement is certainly encouraged
by most humanists.

Spiritualism/deism is only selectively incompatible with replism with
rules coming from prophets and other amateur social engineers about
which replism-derived behaviors must be suppressed. The problem being
that those amateur social engineers are usually more concerned with
preserving their own power than in what's best for The People overall
and so they let things like replism-based tribalism run free and even
encourage it in many cases.

Humanism and replism are also only partially incompatible because
replism assumes these innate sources are naturally good whereas
humanism would at least impose some constraints based on rational
decisionmaking on them. Most Humanists do seem to assume that most of
these innate behaviors are "good", though, mostly I think because
humanists are just another variety of amateur social engineers and so
don't even consider all the ramifications of allowing each Clination
to be expressed unimpeded.

Matchism would therefore be classified between spiritualism/deism and
humanism: It takes from the former a definite concept that "good" is
to be defined independently of instinctive behavior and enforced by
establishing a set of rules (laws and policies) that people must
follow. It takes from the latter that the rules should be derived from
rational analysis (albeit collective rational analysis) rather than
the proclamations of amateur social engineer religious leaders.
Matchism doesn't make the assumption of innate goodness that humanism
(and even deism to some extent) relies on: Everything is subject to
negotiation depending on the environmental and technological
conditions under which the decisions will be made. It is therefore the
only philosophy that fully rejects the "innate good" aspect of
replism.

I think this means I'm settling on "replism" as the name for this
concept. What does "replism" mean to you?

    Scott

Science fiction is often useful.

In one story, we did not be allowed to be "wild humans" (since we had
pretty much killed ourselves)

In another all rhe original style humans were kept in a planet sized zoo
and left not quite unsupervized.  I think we would call them heirloom
humans.  Not very nice but the winners really really knew they were the
best most flexible smartness most rurhless and unbeatable and also  knew
that just maybe they were wrong.

In any case I think you are ignoring data that human evolution has speeded
up at when we became civilized.  Even without GMO humans and without
considering lamarcism influences, the selection pressure is intense.

It's sad because I can think of antonyms for humanist, but the most fitting
one, fascism, is already so damn misunderstood/loaded I think we might be
better off just creating one. A-humanist? Inhumanist?

The inhumanity principle was coined by jeffers.  He is usually called a
fascist but more an isolationist and a deeply distrustful person concerning
civilization.  Personally, I doubt that he held a high opinion of any
extant or even archaic political system in the last ten millenia.  That he
is sensibe we can note that few of those political systems are successful.

I enjoyed his poetry.  Would that the only political commentary must need
be in rhyme

I see replism as an abstract form of survivalism, I consider most succesful
system as proof that survivalism is the key to create a continuum.
As tecnology shift and ICT become mature survivalist are the one that are
better in being able to adapt. And they are searching for solution
Politically is just a matter of sufficient means to survive in the short
term, while a survivalist plan the long term. Survivalist can shift from
fascist to leftist, to centeright ect.ect. but they are looking to give
answers to solve problem.
Once survivalist will "take over", and I belive will eventually happen.
then a new era will begin. They will implement sostenibilism as a rule and
all decision will become entangled in the process. I believe that the new
era will become a reality, but maybe I will not be here to see it happen.
Am I a dreamer?

Just to show you how weird Boulder is, the local paper actually
published the Guest Opinion I sent them (albeit a few weeks ago):
http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_31017240/scott-raney-defense-social-engineering

I don't think this is a good general-purpose PR strategy, but it does
show that there are people out there willing to consider a new way of
doing things. It's mainly a matter of figuring out how to find them.
Once we get rolling word-of-mouth should carry us the rest of the
way...

Hmm: it seems survivalist has a completely different meaning here in
the US. Here a survivalist, often called a "prepper", is someone
preparing for the end of civilization (guns, bunkers, long-term food
storage, developing hunting and fighting skills, hording gold, etc.)

"sostenibilism" is another problematic term: There doesn't seem to be
any English equivalent for that, but it seems to translate to being a
proponent of sustainable economics.

But it looks to me like the opposite is happening: The left,
especially in the US, is dying and as I said a few posts ago there are
very few people actively working on new ideas or systems to replace
those that arose out of the civil rights and antiwar movements of the
1960s. Trump's inability to function I think will push the pendulum
back toward that a bit (e.g. Fox News has fallen behind both CNN and
MSNBC for the first time), but overall the movement seems to be toward
nationalism (tribalism) just about everywhere. You may not live to see
the new order, but unfortunately you (we) may all live long enough to
experience the chaos that will lead to it...

I just discovered Mussolini's manifesto, which I hadn't run across
before. Not a great piece of work (maybe a bad translation?) but I
think it is worth dissecting:
http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm

It certainly fits with your claim of it being anti-humanist, at least
so far as it applies to the cultural/political level. In a sense
fascism is a derivative of replism at least as far as you could claim
that the social and organizational directives of replism that
benefited genes in the EEA still apply in the modern world. That
manifesto even treads into social engineering territory a bit, with a
strong prescription for conditioning to ensure that The People are
properly shaped cogs to be working components in the fascist machine.

Unfortunately it's less useful when you try to apply it to individual
behavior that doesn't directly relate to support for the State. For
example, that manifesto contains strong support for religion
(Catholicism) but primarily as an organizational tool, not as a source
of moral code. To the extent the chosen religion conflicts with the
needs of the State, the religion is the one that would have to change.
To the extent that it's directives don't concern an individual's
relationship to the State, *any* religion would work as an organizing
mechanism. In that sense fascism is agnostic WRT the source of a moral
code that would apply to relationships between people rather than
between the individual and the state.

That manifesto has a lot of confusing, contradictory, and even
provably wrong things in it, though. I had to laugh at this one, for
example, which is a weak (and totally wrong) analysis of what is
sometimes called "group selection theory":
"The maxim that society exists only for the well-being and freedom of
the individuals composing it does not seem to be in conformity with
nature's plans, which care only for the species and seem ready to
sacrifice the individual."

I also had to scratch my head at the coining of the term
"authoritarian democracy", which is possibly an oxymoron but at the
very least is not at all the decisionmaking system he seems to be
proposing: Fascism as he describes it, and as it has always been
implemented, is a form of oligarchy, not democracy.

But back to the main topic: I don't think fascism is the opposite of
humanism. In fact if you read the humanist manifesto, there's only
thing in there that is actually directly contradictory to fascism
(humanism contains a prohibition on violence whereas fascism would
seem to endorse the use of violence against targets outside the
State):
https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/manifesto3/

This I think says more about the amateur social engineering
foundations of humanism than anything about its relationship to
fascism. It's an exclusive (as opposed to inclusive) philosophy
because it lacks any mention of individual differences (some of which
cause people to have different goals and to exhibit behavior
incompatible with the "rules"), the source or source of control over
individual behavior (i.e. who decides what is "good", and how, and
what are the consequences of failing to do "good"), any specificity
about the form of government or decisionmaking, or what the Goals of
the People should be, how they should be determined, and what
compromises are allowed in achieving them. Mussolini's fascism at
least takes a stab at all of these things, even though in most cases
it's SDAPs that end up making the decisions to suit themselves (as
"Democratic Authoritarians", I guess ;-)

But can you make a useful prediction about what changes are occurring
and what effect that will have on the optimal system for human
government? My theory is that things are getting worse WRT
oligarchy/misrepresentative democracy/dictatorship because selection
pressures that would have eliminated problematic individuals
(particularly SDAPs) from the population are no longer operating
(psychopaths in particular probably rarely reached adulthood 10,000
years ago). And the reproductive success of some of these individuals
is astounding: For example it's been reported that 10% of men in
Mongolia carry Genghis Khan's Y-chromosome. An interesting related
fact is that the murder rate in Mongolia is almost 10 times that of
China...
